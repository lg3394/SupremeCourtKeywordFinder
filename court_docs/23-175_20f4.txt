 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-175, City

 of Grants Pass versus Johnson.

 Ms. Evangelis.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEANE D. EVANGELIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Like cities nationwide, Grants Pass 

relies on camping laws to protect its public 

spaces.  These generally applicable laws 

prohibit specific conduct and are essential to 

public health and safety. 

The Ninth Circuit tied cities' hands 

by constitutionalizing the policy debate over 

how to address growing encampments.  Its holding 

that the Eighth Amendment bars Grants Pass from 

enforcing its camping laws is wrong for three 

reasons. 

First, the Cruel and Unusual 

Punishments Clause governs which punishments are 

permitted, not what conduct can be prohibited. 

Second, no precedent supports the

 Ninth Circuit's rule.  Respondents and the

 United States abandon its reliance on Powell.

 Instead, they misread Robinson to bar any 

punishment for involuntary conduct that's linked 

to a status. But Robinson held only that states

 cannot outlaw the status of drug addiction.  It 

made clear that they can prohibit conduct like

 drug use.  This Court should not rewrite 

Robinson six decades later. 

Third, the Ninth Circuit's approach 

has proven unworkable.  The Eighth Amendment 

does not tell courts who is involuntarily 

homeless, what shelter is adequate, or what 

time, place, and manner regulations are allowed. 

But, in 35 suits and counting, federal courts 

are now deciding everything from the exact size 

of campsites in San Rafael to the adequacy of 

empty beds at specific shelters, like the Gospel 

Rescue Mission in Grants Pass, and cities are 

struggling to apply arbitrary, shifting 

standards in the field. 

This Court should reverse and end the 

Ninth Circuit's failed experiment, which has 

fueled the spread of encampments while harming 

those it purports to protect.

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you consider these

 civil or criminal penalties?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  They are both, Justice 

Thomas. There is criminal trespass and civil --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Is that involved in

 this case?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes, it is.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  To what extent?  I 

mean, has any of the Petitioner's -- any of the 

parties here been subject to criminal trespass? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, they are at 

issue in the case.  The district court enjoined 

them. And, yes, they -- they do apply here. 

They are for recidivist offenses. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But which party has 

been held accountable for criminal trespass? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes.  So, here, none 

of the individuals who are currently in the 

case. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what's involved in 

this case? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  For Logan and Johnson, 

civil, the civil penalties. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And so what -- is it

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes, it is.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. So that's

 civil, or is it criminal?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  The camping ordinance

 is civil.  And then, for repeat offenders, it's

 punishable --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. So --

MS. EVANGELIS:  -- by criminal 

trespass. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But we're not talking 

about repeat offenders right now, right? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So -- and then -- so 

-- so then have we ever applied the Eighth 

Amendment to civil penalties? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Not the Cruel and 

Unusual Punishments Clause, no. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what 

will the City do if you don't prevail here? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  The City's hands will 

be tied.  It will be forced to surrender its 

public spaces, as it has been.  Unfortunately, 

beds are going unused at the Gospel Rescue 

Mission.  People are not getting the help that

they need.

 The City is under an injunction here, 

and it's unable to rely on these basic

 ordinances.  And the Ninth Circuit's decisions 

give cities like Grants Pass no guidance about 

how they can navigate this very challenging 

area. The Ninth Circuit has effectively imposed 

a municipal code under the Ninth Circuit's 

Martin rule to regulate what the City can do in 

its public spaces. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I 

just stop you a moment?  The Gospel unused beds, 

they're less than a hundred, right? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there's 

thousands of homeless? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  There are, I believe, 

as many as 600 in Grants Pass according to the 

district court's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there's still 

only less than a hundred beds? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  That is right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now can I stop you

MS. EVANGELIS:  We think Robinson was 

wrongly decided and should not be extended, but 

we don't think that the Court needs to overrule

 it here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.

 Assuming it's there --

MS. EVANGELIS:  -- because it's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it prohibits

 you criminalizing homelessness, right?  So what 

you do is say only homeless people who sleep 

outdoors will be arrested?  That's the testimony 

of your chief of -- of police, two -- and two or 

three officers, which is, if you read the crime, 

it's only stopping you from sleeping in public 

if you -- for the purpose of maintaining a 

temporary place to live. 

And the police officers testified that 

that means that if a stargazer wants to take a 

blanket or a sleeping bag out at night to watch 

the stars and falls asleep, you don't arrest 

them. You don't arrest babies who have blankets 

over them.  You don't arrest people who are 

sleeping on the beach, as I tend to do if I've 

been there a while. 

You only arrest people who don't have

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who don't have a

 home?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  So, no.  These laws

 are generally applicable.  They apply to

 everyone.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah, that's what 

you want to say. Give me one example, because 

your police officers couldn't, and they 

explicitly said, if someone has another home --

has a home, and is out there and happens to fall 

asleep, they won't be arrested -- fall asleep 

with something on them. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, Joint Appendix, 

page 98, is one example of a citation issued to 

a person with a home address.  But, more 

importantly, I think what we're getting at here 

is that these laws regulate conduct of everyone. 

There's nothing in the law that criminalizes 

homelessness.  I really want to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what --

that's what you say, but if I look at the record 

and see differently, it's a different argument, 

isn't it?

MS. EVANGELIS:  Grants Pass policy

 actually very clearly says that being homeless 

is not a crime. And that's in --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I -- I know

 that's what you say, but if you're enforcing it 

only against the homeless, I will suggest that

 you look -- there's one brief -- let me see if I

 can find it -- that talks about this.  At any

 rate, I'll find it later and -- and just mention 

it. 

The second thing I want to ask you is 

you seemed to start by saying that the Eighth 

Amendment is limited to forms of punishment and 

not to the nature of punishment, the 

proportionality issue. 

There also is a number of amicus brief 

that lays out for us that from the Magna Carta 

through the founding, through state laws, 

through Weems, which was in 1910, through Trop 

later in the century, that throughout all of 

that, both the English, American colonies, this 

Court has had some form of proportionality in 

their Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. 

You're asking us to ignore all of that 

history.

MS. EVANGELIS:  No, we're not, Justice 

Sotomayor. What we are saying is that this case

 doesn't implicate proportionality.  We're not 

asking the Court to take a position on whether

 it's a proper inquiry under the Eighth

 Amendment.

 For example --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, yes. Yes, you 

are, because you're saying that the only thing 

that's prohibited by the Eighth Amendment is the 

form of punishment.  But, in those cases and in 

our history, we have said that certain 

punishments, Trop, for example, can't be done. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  That's right.  And the 

Court has always looked at, if a particular 

punishment is considered too extreme or 

categorically so, as in the death penalty in 

some cases, the Court looks at whether a lesser 

punishment would be acceptable. 

Again, it's looking at punishment, and 

that's where the inquiry focuses.  Here, only --

what -- what the Respondents are asking this 

Court to do is to extend Robinson beyond --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have hotels 

that are valued at 200, $250 in your city?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's assume 

because, even in New York City, which may be the 

most expensive city in the nation or close to

 it, there are hotels that are less than that or 

at that price. 

If a homeless person had that kind of 

money, do you -- don't you think they'd stay in 

a hotel? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  So, Justice Sotomayor, 

the -- the difficulty here is that this rule 

that the Respondents are proposing rests on 

whether someone's conduct is involuntary.  Most 

importantly here, we're talking about conduct, 

so I want to talk about how this is completely 

distinguishable from Robinson.  The point --

could you criminalize the status of

a status.  It's the status of not having a home. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  I actually -- I 

disagree with that, Justice Kagan, because it is 

so fluid, it's so different.  People 

experiencing homelessness might be one day 

without shelter, the next day with.  The federal

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I -- it's really

 a simple question.  Can you criminalize

 homelessness?  And you're suggesting, yes, you

 could.

 MS. EVANGELIS:  No, we do not

 criminalize homelessness.  I'm not saying --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you criminalize

 homelessness?  Not tell me what you do do, what

 you don't do.  Could you? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  So I think there would 

be due process problems and vagueness problems. 

I don't think there's an Eighth Amendment 

problem in the sense of Robinson because that 

was a limited decision where the holding was 

solely about a disease of addiction.  The Court 

was very clear about distinguishing between 

addiction and possession or use. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, count -- count 

MS. EVANGELIS:  And so --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I -- you're right 

that it's a different status that was involved 

in Robinson.  But Robinson made clear that there

 And when you started off here today, 

you said we're just criminalizing conduct. So, 

to tell you the truth, I thought that this was

 going to be a question where you would say, no, 

of course, we can't criminalize a status, but 

there's conduct here. And then I was going to

 say: What is the conduct here?

 But you didn't say that.  You said you 

could criminalize even the status of 

homelessness, and that suggests to me that --

that you're off on the wrong track in thinking 

about this issue. 

MS. EVANGELIS: So, Justice Kagan, I 

think the -- the point where we are disagreeing 

here is really about whether the Eighth 

Amendment is the right framework for this 

discussion. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the Eighth 

Amendment was the framework in Robinson. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  And I --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So taking Robinson as 

a given, where Robinson said the Eighth 

Amendment protects you against status-based 

crimes --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- a campsite suggests

 something different to people.  It suggests a

 tent. It suggests a conglomeration of people.

 You know, tent camps, if you will.

 But your ordinance does not just 

prohibit that. Your ordinance prohibits a

 single person who is homeless, so does not have

 another place to sleep, that's a status, I don't 

have another place to sleep, a single person 

sleeping instead in public with a blanket. 

That's what I understand your statute to do. 

Is that not what your statute does? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  The statute does --

does not say anything about homelessness.  It's 

a generally applicable law.  One more -- it --

it's very important that it applies to everyone,

 MS. EVANGELIS:  And sleeping in

 conduct is considered -- excuse me, sleeping in

 public is considered conduct.  And this Court --

this Court in Clark discussed that, that that is

 conduct.

 Also, the federal regulations --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, sleeping is --

MS. EVANGELIS:  -- are very --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- a biological 

necessity.  It's sort of like breathing.  I 

mean, you could say breathing is conduct too, 

but, presumably, you would not think that it's 

okay to criminalize breathing in public. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  I would like to point 

to the federal regulations which I brought up. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And for a homeless 

person who has no place to go, sleeping in 

public is kind of like breathing in public. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, two points. 

So, first, even the federal 

regulations prohibit even sleeping.  They don't 

even require any materials, it -- including 

but -- but not necessary under the federal 

regulation.  So this is conduct that is

one set of issues.

that. Your ordinance says as to a person -- and 

I understand that you think it's generally 

applicable, but we only come up with this 

problem for a person who is homeless, who has 

the status of homelessness, who has no other

 that's why that law was so unique. It's a very

 peculiar --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So it seems to me 

that Robinson actually hurts you and not helps

 you in the following sense.  You know, it seems 

both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts

 that constitute basic human needs.

 So, here, unlike in Robinson, where, 

you know, you had at least the sort of disease 

state, drugs and -- and -- and the like, and 

potentially culpable acts that relate to that 

disease state, here, we're talking about 

sleeping that is universal, that is a basic 

function.  And so I guess what I don't 

understand is, in this circumstance, why that 

particular state is being considered conduct for 

the purpose of -- of -- of punishment.

just illustrates the line-drawing problems

 hypothetical?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  -- all sorts of

 behavior.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I give you a

 hypothetical?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes.  Thank you.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  So suppose 

the relevant ordinance prohibited eating on 

public property rather than sleeping or camping. 

We're talking about eating.  And the city, for 

very, you know, rational reasons, has determined 

that when people eat outdoors, it creates 

problems with trash and rodents and the like, 

and so it bans eating in public places and it 

punishes violators. 

Now, just as here, that seems 

generally fine because most people have 

restaurants that they can go to, most people 

have houses that they can eat in.  But some 

people don't have that option. They have to eat 

in public because they're unhoused and they 

can't afford to go to a restaurant. 

So is -- is your argument, same

excuse me, even though that's a human necessity

happening is you're only punishing certain

 saying the law -- that the law draws lines on 

any sort of irrational basis or any equal

MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- there is trash,

human need privately are okay.  They're not

 punished for it.  But people who don't have any

 other option or opportunity except for to do it 

in public are the ones who are being targeted by

 this statute.

 MS. EVANGELIS:  So two responses.

 First, I think the Eighth Amendment is

 the wrong way to look at it.  Someone might have

 a due process challenge to a law like that if 

there is a deeply entrenched liberty interest. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But punishment is 

happening.  In my hypothetical, people are going 

to jail because they're eating in public. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  So, in that case --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why is the Eighth 

Amendment not implicated? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  -- in that case, you 

would have a defense under Oregon law, for 

example, a necessity defense.

MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But -- but, on that 

point, I think we're having some debate about 

where to lodge the defense, whether it's under 

the Eighth Amendment or under the Fourteenth

 Amendment.

 But do you concede that there are 

instances in which a necessity defense, long

 recognized at common law, would apply to eating 

in public, sleeping in public, or other things 

like that? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes, I agree. And, 

actually, here, in the case of camping, Oregon 

law recognizes a necessity defense, so as a 

matter of state law and policy -- and, again, 

that goes to the difficult policy questions --

that's why states are able to address the needs 

of what this issue raises. 

And so, for something under Oregon's 

state law, a person could raise that defense 

under the necessity defense, and then, if that's 

not enough, if they believe that that's not 

broad enough somehow --

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- Oregon law has

MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- already built

 into it?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  Thank

 you. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let me ask you about 

Oregon law, because one sort of threshold 

concern that I have about this case is I 

understand that Oregon has enacted a statute, a 

new statute, that seems to address this very 

issue, so I'm trying to understand why this is 

-- is still a live case. 

As I read the new law, it essentially 

codifies Martin's rule, that it says something 

about all regulations of this nature have to be 

objectively reasonable as to time, place, and 

manner with regard to -- with regards to people 

experiencing homelessness. 

So it seems like the state has already 

precluded Grants Pass from doing the sort of 

thing it's doing here, so why do we need to

weigh in on that?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, no, it hasn't.

 So, first, both sides agree that it -- this case 

is not moot. There is no state law challenge in

 this case.  But, more importantly, that standard 

is very different from Martin, and there's never 

been a challenge to our laws.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  What about

 constitutional avoidance?  So, fine, it's not 

moot, but wouldn't our principle be that we 

don't need to reach the constitutionality of 

this issue if there's another possible way of 

resolving it because the state has addressed it? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, not at all. So 

the state's law is very different.  And we 

believe our law is satisfied. 

But, more importantly, the fact that 

the state is acting here is a good thing.  We 

agree that states should be able to make policy 

and to weigh all of the competing concerns. 

And, here, the -- the need to reverse 

Martin is so critical because laws like ours, 

they really do serve an essential purpose.  They 

protect the health and safety of everyone.  It 

is not safe to live in encampments.  It's

to limit the use of fires and encampments, 

tents, those kinds of temporary shelters?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  It really does because

 the rationale of Martin, the -- the argument

 that it's a biological necessity to sleep 

outside, the Respondents argue a blanket is

 necessary in Oregon.  Some might argue a tent

 and a fire is necessary in North Dakota.  The 

Eighth Amendment really doesn't give us any 

answers to what cities can and can't prohibit. 

It's really administratively impossible for 

cities on the ground, as well as for courts, to 

administer.  So we're seeing --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  This 

-- we have nothing to do with fires or tents.

injunction, and the circuit court didn't require 

that. We're talking only about sleeping with a 

blanket.

 not permitting time/place restrictions.

 Let's go beyond that.  Let's go here. 

Here, you're not precluded from prohibiting

 fires. You're not precluded from prohibiting 

tents. What's at issue is are you prohibited

 from keeping -- having someone wear a blanket

 anywhere in the city. 

Your intent was to remove -- stated by 

your mayor, intent is to remove every homeless 

person and give them no public space to sit down 

with a blanket or lay down with a blanket and 

fall asleep.

 MS. EVANGELIS:  So this is -- a

 necessity defense, as I mentioned, under Oregon

 law is available. States are able to address

 these concerns.  This is a complicated policy

 question.  We believe that the Eighth Amendment

 analysis, to go back to it, focuses on the

 low-level fines.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's so 

complicated about letting someone somewhere 

sleep with a blanket in the outside if they have 

nowhere to sleep?  The laws against defecation, 

the laws against keeping things unsanitary 

around yourself, those have all been upheld. 

The only thing this injunction does is 

say you can't stop someone from sleeping in a 

public place without a blanket. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you 

answer and then we'll move on to the next round, 

and you can be thinking about an answer to 

Justice Sotomayor while they -- we move into a

Is being a bank robber a status?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  No. I would say

 that -- well -- well, if -- if your question is 

asking would it be permissible to punish being a 

bank robber, I think that would have vagueness

 problems probably. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it would

 be someone who robbed a bank.  That doesn't

 sound vague. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, I don't -- I --

I don't think that it is a status in the sense 

of Robinson, which, again, I -- I want to just 

focus on what we think Robinson stands for, and 

it's only its narrow holding about addiction. 

And the -- there, it was the status of 

being an addict without any mens rea.  So a law 

like that -- excuse me, without any actus reus. 

A law like that is problematic.  Without an 

actus reus, I think it would probably have 

vagueness problems, due process problems. 

However, the Eighth Amendment, this 

entire exercise under Robinson is the only time 

this Court has ever evaluated the substantive 

criminal law, and it raises all of these 

line-drawing problems. And the fact that -- I'm

 first principles, we don't agree with it.  We

 think it was wrongly decided.  We're just saying 

that it is so far removed -- that our laws are 

so far removed from what was at issue in

 Robinson that it just isn't implicated here.

is homeless for a week and then finds available 

shelter, is that person homeless when he's in 

the shelter?

someone comes around and tells them that they're 

not permitted to camp, are they involuntarily

 there if they refused shelter yesterday?  That's 

the question the Eighth Amendment does not

 answer.

 This is very complex.  What if there

 is a bed available in the Gospel Rescue Mission, 

but like Ms. Johnson, a person doesn't wish to

 leave their pet?  Her Rottweiler's not permitted 

there. So that is a difficult question for a 

person and a difficult policy question, but --

included a crime of, as I read it, "either to 

use narcotics or to be addicted to the use of 

narcotics," and the Court was concerned about 

being -- the status of being addicted to the 

use. 

Is there a crime here for being

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Robinson presents a

 very difficult conceptual question.  Do you

 think that someone who is a drug addict is

 absolutely incapable of -- that all people who 

are drug addicts are absolutely incapable of

 refraining from using drugs?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, I think that for

they can abstain. But that's a question of free 

will and agency that's true of all -- every law 

and what conduct we choose to regulate.  That's

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Then 

compare that with a person who absolutely has no 

place to sleep in a particular jurisdiction. 

Does that person have any alternative 

other than sleeping outside?

to ask all the questions I mentioned earlier 

about what alternatives they might have had 

yesterday --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- they have none.

 They have absolutely none.  There's not a single

 place where they can sleep.

 MS. EVANGELIS:  If that's true, then

 that may be the case, and in that case, at least 

in Oregon, they would have a defense of

 necessity.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So the point is that 

the connection between drug addiction and drug 

usage is more tenuous than the connection 

between absolute homelessness and sleeping 

outside. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Well, I -- I think, 

in -- in Robinson, again, the Court did draw 

that line, but, here, the Respondents are saying 

that the two are really the same, that camping 

outside, sleeping outside, and being homeless 

are two sides of the same coin. 

We think that that's wrong.  It's 

collapsing the status that they claim into the 

conduct.  So we think the conduct here is very 

clear because it applies generally to everyone. 

The law does not say on its face it is a crime 

to be homeless.  I just want to --

Ninth Circuit never reached the excessive fines 

question presented by this case, correct?

open. And you didn't seek cert on that issue? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  That's correct.

Assuming that there is no standing, I understand

camping outside died, during the pendency of

 MS. EVANGELIS:  Sure.  Well, the

 case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Should we be

 vacating and remanding to see if there is --

MS. EVANGELIS:  No. So, here, the --

the sleeping ordinance, which is the one that 

Ms. Blake challenged, that is no longer in the 

case. That ordinance limited only sleeping in 

certain rights-of-way and sidewalks in the city, 

and it was a different law, and that's not at 

issue here. 

So sleeping is not at issue.  It's 

about the camping ordinance. And we very much

Circuit's injunction, and the named plaintiffs

 example, talks about what officers are supposed

 to do. They're supposed to put people in touch 

with services first to contact if there is

 available help for them.  These laws are

 absolutely a tool for getting people the

 services that they need.  Many people need that

 necessity defense, what we're telling officers 

to do is to, you know, act consistently with 

that defense so that if it is truly a matter of

 need that you are sleeping on the street alone

 with a blanket, no, the officer should not cite

 the person?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  There's nothing in the

 record here that shows officers were told about 

a necessity defense and that it -- what it would 

or would not preclude.  That would be an 

individualized question after the fact if 

someone received a citation. 

And if they thought that that wasn't 

enough, the proper framework would be this 

Court's framework in Kahler, where we would look 

at the asserted defense, there, insanity of some 

form, and, here, it would be necessity, and we 

would ask whether it is so deeply rooted in our 

history and -- and something that has to be 

imposed in this way on the states.

MS. EVANGELIS:  One of the most 

difficult challenges is getting people the help 

that they need.  And laws like this allow cities 

to intervene, and they're an important tool in 

helping incentivize people to accept shelter. 

So Ms. Johnson, for example, has said 

in her deposition -- it's in the Joint 

Appendix -- that she does not wish to stay at 

the Gospel Rescue Mission.  One of the reasons 

is because of her dog. She also had other

there is harm in simply camping.  Whatever 

materials people are using when they are living

infrastructure, there's harm to the whole city

MS. EVANGELIS:  No. That's what we've

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's a separate

 issue, I agree.

 MS. EVANGELIS:  It is.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And -- and it can 

be a challenging issue, I suppose, I know, as 

well. 

Let me ask one last question, which 

is, how does the necessity defense differ from 

the constitutional rule?  You touched on this, 

but I just want to get a succinct answer to 

that, the state law necessity defense differ 

from the constitutional rule here. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  You would weigh the 

harm from the individual's conduct in violating 

the law.  So, if someone were camping near a 

school or near -- or -- or -- or doing some --

something or engaged in some behavior that was 

particularly harmful and they had another place 

where they could camp, that would be maybe a 

factor that you would raise in the necessity 

situation.

It's -- it's narrower. So, in a case

 of a -- the Oregon cases include people who are

 growing marijuana for medical reasons but

 without a license, and so the necessity defense

 was not accepted in that case because they could

 have obtained a license.  So, if a person had a 

friend to go to, had a bed available at the 

Gospel Rescue Mission, they would be expected to 

take it under the necessity defense. 

I think that's how it would play out. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I actually have 

one last question.  When you get out of jail if 

you end up -- what's going to happen then? 

Aren't -- you still don't have a bed available. 

So how does this help? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  So the -- and -- and I 

want -- I do want to make a point about that --

about the criminal aspect.  The trespass law 

here is only triggered after several civil 

citations.

going to my earlier question, if there aren't 

beds available in the jurisdiction, unless

 decide to -- to leave somehow.

 MS. EVANGELIS:  No. There are 

services available, and the jurisdiction can put

mismatch and there are going to be some people

 who can't be cared for.

 Are you saying that if your law is 

enforced, there is a way for everyone to be

 cared for?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  No. I'm saying that's 

a policy question that is quite difficult, but 

these laws are an important part of the puzzle. 

They're not the only solution.  And we don't --

we don't believe that they are, but we think 

they're an important tool.  And without them, 

we've seen what's happened on our streets. 

We've seen that people are -- are dying in 

encampments.  We've seen that cities are -- are 

being forced to cede all of their public spaces. 

So that ultimate question is for the 

legislature and policymakers to figure out what 

the right solution, what the right mix of 

policies is.  But the wrong answer is to do what 

the Ninth Circuit did here and to 

constitutionalize --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Let me -- let 

me just interrupt you there.  You're right, it's 

a very, very difficult policy question.  And I

asked you before about whether this was just

 about blankets or whether it went into having

 fires or urinating and defecating outdoors and 

that sort of thing, and Justice Sotomayor

 pointed out that this particular injunction did

 carve out those things and was just talking

 about sleep.

 But, you know, other cases have been 

litigated in the Ninth Circuit that have gone 

beyond that, and because the line is things that 

are involuntary, that are human needs, it can --

it can extend -- it's difficult to draw the 

line, and whatever we decide here about this 

case is about the line. 

So can you describe for me some of the 

things that are difficult to figure out about 

the line?  There's sleeping.  There's sleeping 

with blankets.  What else? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Public urination and 

defecation, that is a serious problem.  Those 

are parts of biological necessities of being 

human. A court in Sacramento addressed that, 

and the Ninth Circuit's opinions debated whether 

its rule would actually reach those things. 

I think any rule that we are wondering

 about and debating whether it would go that far, 

I think that is a sign that it is not a workable

 rule. The slippery slope here is very real.

 It's not just for camping and conduct that might

 be a biological necessity.  Putting aside tents 

and fires and cold climates, what other things

 would be allowed?

 All of the things that a human needs

 to survive, for example, potentially come into 

focus under the Ninth Circuit's rule but also in 

other areas.  Someone could say that my drug use 

or possession is the other side of the coin 

because I'm an addict or because I -- a -- a 

person who violates other laws could say that I 

had a compulsion to do those things that I 

couldn't control. 

And the plurality opinion in Powell 

addressed that very thing and why it's so 

important to draw the line there.  And when 

conduct is involved and once the Court gets into 

deciding which conduct may be excused under the 

Eighth Amendment, it is so far afield of what 

the Eighth Amendment was ever understood to 

address.

Robinson was wrong and we don't need to overrule

 should overrule Robinson.

 You've also been kind of resisting the

 status -- you -- you've been resisting

 characterizing anything other than the drug 

addiction that was at issue in Robinson as

 status. 

So what if the law said it is unlawful 

and punishable by 30 days in prison to have the 

status of homelessness?  Just go with me.  Just 

assume that the law defines homelessness as a 

status and it is a status. 

Would Robinson say that that law is 

unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment? 

Would you concede that?

line where a law has no actus reus.  So I think 

that's the easiest line.  I -- I don't defend

don't think actually that the Court -- I know 

the Court didn't rely on any Eighth Amendment

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But the hypothetical 

I just gave you had no actus reus either.  The

Justice Barrett left off, you -- you -- you say 

that the ordinance here pertains to conduct and 

not to status, and I'm just trying to figure 

that out.  I'm not so sure for this reason. 

It's because all humans engage in the act in 

question, sleeping.  And yet the statute 

operates or the ordinance operates to penalize 

only certain individuals, those who have no 

choice but to do that act in public. 

So it appears, I think, not to be the 

act that the state or the city in this case

 as engaged in by certain people, by people who

 cannot afford housing and have nowhere else to

 go.

 So why is that the wrong way to think

 about it? And if that is the right way to think

 about it, why isn't that a status crime in the 

way that Robinson contemplates?

 MS. EVANGELIS:  It's not because we 

can look at the law and it has a conduct 

element.  The conduct is establishing a place --

a campsite, and that is something that a person 

who has a home or a shelter could do as well. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But -- but you've 

just defined away the -- the basic actus reus, 

right? The actus reus is sleeping out -- I 

guess outside to the extent you put outside in 

it, but that's the problem I'm talking about. 

The actus reus is the sleeping, right? 

Everybody -- that's not a criminally culpable 

kind of activity. 

That's what I think might distinguish 

it from Robinson and -- and make it worse for 

you in a way because, in Robinson at least, to

question was, well, are they engaging in

 otherwise criminally culpable conduct, buying

 and selling drugs, taking drugs, you know, we --

we look at that kind of category of things.

 Here, the actus reus is sleeping,

 human, universal.  The -- the -- the -- the City

 adds, okay, but you can't sleep outside.  And I

 guess what I'm trying to understand is, to the

 extent that that only happens with respect to a 

certain category of people who have no other 

place to go, why isn't that really just 

punishing the status of being someone who 

doesn't have any place to go? 

MS. EVANGELIS:  It doesn't apply only 

to that -- those people. The Respondents here 

are trying to exempt a whole category of people. 

What -- so what you look at there is the -- the 

conduct of camping under federal law and in this 

Court's decision in Clark, it was understood 

that that is conduct.  It is just like trespass, 

where, if you are found in a place, if you enter 

with permission, but then you remain there 

without permission under Quarles --

 other places to go.  So let me just -- let me 

just ask you this other question.

 What -- what is your understanding of

 the Martin rule?  Because I -- I thought it was 

premised on the circumstance in which someone 

had nowhere else to go and they needed to sleep

 and they needed to be there.  But you seem to 

suggest that necessity is not sort of baked into

 what Martin was doing. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Martin speaks in terms 

of someone who is involuntarily homeless, and 

that raises all of those policy questions that 

we've been discussing about how do you determine 

that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But assume they 

exist. Involuntarily homeless means the person 

has nowhere else to sleep. 

MS. EVANGELIS:  Yes, that is -- the 

necessity defense is available.  And what 

Respondents are asking to do is to 

constitutionalize that very defense under the 

Eighth Amendment. 

So, as I said earlier, it could be --

the argument could be made -- it would be a very 

high bar under due process, but that is the sort

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

In Robinson, this Court held that the 

government cannot criminalize status.  And 

Respondent has conceded here today that the City 

cannot criminalize the status of being homeless. 

Our narrow submission in this case is 

that government cannot circumvent the principle 

of Robinson by making it unlawful for a person 

to reside in the jurisdiction if he has that 

status. 

That is what the ordinances here do. 

As applied to someone who has nowhere else to 

sleep, which is an essential human function, the

 ordinances are the equivalent of making it a 

crime to be homeless while living in Grants

 Pass.

 Although we think the Ninth Circuit 

was right to recognize that the core principle 

of Robinson is implicated in this case, the

 Court was wrong to award broad injunctive relief 

in the circumstances and manner in which it did.

 The Robinson principle requires an 

individualized determination, and the Ninth 

Circuit's failure to require such a 

determination and its issuance of much broader 

injunctive relief has led to the problems at 

issue that the Petitioner and its amici have 

raised, not the core principle of Robinson. 

And, therefore, we urge the Court to 

adhere to the core principle of Robinson but to 

emphasize that cities have flexibility to 

implement these, and, in particular, time, 

place, and manner restrictions on where someone 

can sleep are entirely valid if they are 

reasonable, and, indeed, the state law that 

Justice Jackson referred to establishes a state 

policy that time, manner, and place restrictions 

are the way to go if they are reasonable.

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Kneedler, 

wouldn't you have a better argument if Robinson

 involved the -- someone being arrested for using

 drugs, but then the Court said that you were in 

effect arresting him for the -- the status of a

 drug user because he was -- he had no choice but 

to use drugs because he's an addict?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No. Our -- our 

position is not that the conduct as in Robinson, 

the drug addict can't stop from using drugs. 

That is not our position.  That's a question of 

personal culpability on the basis of what the 

person's makeup --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what's the 

difference between that and -- and -- and 

camping out?  What you're saying here, it seems 

as though you're saying, well, they -- there's 

no other choice, so you have to camp out. 

Therefore, you're really arresting this person 

for the status of homelessness. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but -- but not 

because of an -- of an involuntary compulsion 

sense. I think, as Justice Alito pointed out, 

the nexus here is actually closer than in the --

outside is essentially the mirror image or the

 other side of the coin or the definition --

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- of the status of --

of homelessness.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- Mr. Kneedler, I 

-- I agree that -- that the distinction between 

status and conduct is a slippery one and that 

they're often closely related. 

And in Robinson, though, the Court 

said you cannot make the status of being a drug 

addict a crime, but you can criminalize the 

conduct, even if it is involuntary and 

compulsive.  And Powell reaffirmed that line 

very strongly, at least the plurality opinion 

did, and said we're not going to go further. 

And I wonder whether the government is 

asking us to take that step that Powell 

counseled against by saying that it is -- it is 

-- it is status because -- effectively status, 

and this is throughout your brief. You use the 

word "effective" or "essentially" or "tantamount 

to," those kinds of words.  And -- and so I just 

wanted to get your response to that -- that

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right?  Certain 

people do, and maybe they have addiction, and

 maybe you can't punish them because of the 

addiction, but you can still punish them as 

criminally culpable for engaging in the act.

 It seems to me we are in a totally

 different category --

MR. KNEEDLER:  We are, yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- when you're 

talking about acts that everybody participates 

in that no one thinks in and of themselves are 

criminally culpable. And yet somehow this 

statute is reaching out to punish certain people 

who engage in that universal human basic need. 

That seems to me to be the distinction --

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- in these 

situations. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  That is a critical 

distinction, and -- and not only is it something 

that everybody engages in, but it's something 

that everybody has to engage in to be alive.

at the Gospel Mission.  There's a -- there's a

place to reside.  And so, by speaking of 

individualized, what we were --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 If there is a -- the town next to

 Grants Pass, 10 minutes away, has just completed 

building a homeless shelter that has many vacant 

beds, does that change the analysis here?  I 

mean, we've talked about the town wanting to get 

-- ship people out of the town. 

Would it be -- would -- would it --

would there still be a right to sleep, contrary 

to the ordinances in Grants Pass, because you 

don't want to be taken 10 minutes away where 

there's a homeless shelter? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- that goes to the 

question, I think, under the analysis of whether 

the beds are available.  And I think, if they're 

right across the town line, it would be 

appropriate to take into account that there's a 

homeless shelter there, even though it's not one 

in the City of Grants Pass.

you a ride down the road, 30 miles, whatever it

 is, because there's a new homeless shelter 

there, and the person says, no, I don't want to 

do that, can that person be given a citation?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think probably 

not, but let me -- if -- if I could explain why.

 There are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I mean, obviously, 

there are questions at the -- at the margin 

here. But I think one of the principal features 

here that shouldn't be overlooked is the City is 

seeking to banish or expel its own residents, 

its own citizens, people whose children can go 

to school in that location, who may pay taxes in 

that location. 

So, if the 30-mile-away shelter 

requires the person to leave his community and 

to live in another place, that -- that 

implicates --

I mean, how far does that go?

they all have homeless shelters. And yet the

 person wants to stay.  You know, I've been a

 Grants Pass -- Pass resident for a long time. I 

don't want to go to the one of those shelters.

 Can that person be given a citation?

homeless shelter is right over the line, they

I'm not prepared to say it, you know, that

 absolutely not, but I do -- I do think it's

 different because the City is implementing its 

policy of banishing people, its own residents,

 from the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Banishment is

 something 10 minutes away.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well -- well -- but, 

again, the question is whether you could still 

realistically be part of the community where you 

grew up.  The figures show and, in fact, JA 114, 

115 here shows that most of the homeless people 

in Grants Pass are from Grants Pass. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, 

everyone's mentioned -- not everybody.  Many 

people have mentioned this is a serious policy 

problem, and it's a policy problem because the 

solution, of course, is to build shelter to 

provide shelter for those who are otherwise 

harmless. 

But municipalities have competing 

priorities.  I mean, what if there are lead 

pipes in -- in -- in the -- in the water?  Do 

you build the homeless shelter or do you take

 Why would you think that these nine 

people are the best people to judge and weigh

 those policy judgments?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  We're -- we're not

 suggesting that.  We're not suggesting that the

 only solution is for in -- especially in the 

current circumstances, the only solution would 

be to build homeless shelters. 

As I mentioned, time, place, and

mentioned, Oregon state law requires that.  In 

other words, a -- a city adopts a provision that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is an old 

question, but, you know, eating is a basic human 

function as well that people have to do, just 

like sleeping. So, if someone is hungry and no 

one is giving him food, can you prosecute him if 

he breaks into a store to get something to eat? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Absolutely, absolutely. 

Breaking into -- into a store is a common crime 

that not everybody engages in, unlike sleeping, 

which is what -- which is what we have here, 

which is really --

the Eighth Amendment does not require that that 

person be excused from doing it. I think

 there's a -- there's a certain amount of common

 sense and practicality to this, and it's, I 

think, well understood that just like drug use 

is not something the Eighth Amendment excuses

 you from, either is eating.

 And then the -- the problem of eating 

is addressed at the local level as the, you 

know, history and the poor law shows, is that 

the community takes care of its own residents. 

And it's common now as it was at the 

-- at the founding for churches and individuals 

and whatnot to offer their help, the charity in 

the community.  And that's what happens in 

Grants Pass.  Various organizations feed -- feed 

the -- the homeless people, and there are social 

services to help the homeless people. 

So this is -- this is consistent 

except for the absolute ban in sleeping in the 

City. This -- otherwise, the community's 

response is what has been done down through 

history.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  And I just want

 to clarify one -- one point about that. It's 

not simply a measure of the number of beds 

against the number of homeless people such that 

if there is a deficit, the City can't enforce 

the law at all.

 If you have individualized questioning 

and you know that there are vacant -- there are 

vacancies available, even if not for everybody, 

but there is a vacancy for the person being 

interviewed, then, yes, that person -- if -- if 

that person is offered and refuses, that -- that 

person could be prosecuted and -- or -- or -- or 

cited. So --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the 

person says I -- I -- yeah, I know there's a bed 

available at the Gospel Rescue Mission, but they 

won't take my dog? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yeah, I don't think --

I don't think the inability to take your dog to 

the shelter is a -- is a sufficient reason. 

There are shelters in some larger cities that 

may well take pets, but --

 other location, then -- then you could be

outside, the only place where that person can 

sleep is going to have to be on the street?

 very cold night and somebody wants to make a

 fire. It's raining and somebody wants to put up

 a -- a tarp. The City has said you can sleep in

 particular areas, but it turns out that those 

areas have a ton of crime.

 You know, you could go on and on. And

 I'm -- I'm not -- how do you deal with questions

 like that?  These are not, like, gotcha

questions like that?  Where is the line where

interests can come in and say, you know, as to 

that, as to that, you can't do that? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yeah, so what -- and --

and there are several examples that -- that you 

have there.  With respect to tents and tarps, I 

guess, you -- you were saying, I -- I -- I think 

there's a difference between what you might need 

to realistically sleep outside if it's raining, 

snowing, or something like that, and what you 

might prefer to have as a structure for 

long-term camping. 

As I mentioned, the -- the City might 

say you can put up a tent if it's very cold, but

That's like being in -- some shelters say you

 the City to do it.  It might not want to do it.

Amendment would prevent it from doing it, and

it's in the court hands. And I guess I want to

 know what the principle is where those questions

 go to the courts and -- and why that principle 

is the right principle. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I think -- I mean, I

 think there are two principles.  One is that it 

-- it's the municipality's determination 

certainly in the first instance with a great 

deal of flexibility how to address the question 

of homelessness and a time, place, and manner. 

And then municipalities should -- should be able 

to choose the place, should be able to choose 

the attributes of that place, should be able to 

say we're not going to allow more than, you 

know, 20 people or something, you know, to -- to 

regulate it in that manner. 

And I think the -- I think the 

principle, the Eighth Amendment principle, would 

be whether the -- the City has effectively 

prevented sleeping outside because the 

protections needed from the elements are not 

available.  And, certainly, in Grants Pass, I 

would think even a blanket would not be enough 

on -- under some -- but I think that's the -- I

 think that's the touchstone.

 Are you basically -- does it boil down 

to or is the core principle of Robinson that you

 can't criminalize homelessness, which includes

 not being able to criminalize sleeping outside? 

If you can't sleep outside because of lack of

 protection from the elements, I think that's the

 principle a court would -- would apply.

 But the Ninth Circuit, in a number of 

cases, has gone way beyond that, and we think 

that's really the source of the problems that 

have been identified in the briefs and not the 

core principle of -- of Robinson.

           JUSTICE GORSUCH: You're asking us to 

extend Robinson, and I'm asking how far?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, what I was going 

to say, you could -- you could think of it as

 status, but I think another way to think about 

it, and this is our point about an

 individualized determination, is that place

 realistically available to that person

 because --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It is in the sense 

that the bed is available --

MR. KNEEDLER:  I know that it's --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- but not because 

of their personal circumstances. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  Right. And 

that's -- and that's my point.  It -- it's 

available in a physical sense.  It may be 

available to somebody else, but requiring an 

individualized determination might include 

whether that person could cope in that setting. 

That's the only --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So that -- so that 

might be an Eighth Amendment violation? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Because it may not --

yes, it may -- because it's not available.

the idea that there might be a necessity defense 

in these cases, and there's a footnote in your 

brief that indicates that in a lot of cases you 

could -- you could maybe bring advance 

preliminary injunctive action at least as 

individuals.  And I don't even see why you

 necessity question, given the line-drawing 

problems that we've been going through, if a

 state has a traditional necessity defense, won't

 that take care of most of the concerns, if not 

all, and, therefore, avoid the need for having 

to constitutionalize an area and have a federal

 judge superintend this rather than the local 

community, which you've emphasized many times 

working with the nonprofits and charitable and 

religious organizations, which is how it works 

in most places? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I think that 

the necessity defense at least traditionally has 

required a much stronger sense of urgency and 

imminence than -- than this.  What -- if states 

had a necessity defense and we knew that it was 

available in all of these places, but even in --

in Oregon, I think it's a case called Barrett, 

the Court said it's theoretically possible, but 

there was a remand for factual issues. 

So we don't -- we don't know at this 

point in time whether -- whether there is such a 

defense.  And that's really not in the -- in 

the -- in the case here.  This comes up on an 

Eighth Amendment challenge without -- without

which seems highly instructive in terms of time, 

manner, and place that jurisdictions -- Grants

 Pass should examine. 

But I -- I don't think we can -- I --

I don't think the Court should put this core 

point about Robinson to one side because, in --

of the possibility that in Oregon and maybe, you 

know, maybe no other place, I don't know about 

California law of necessity, maybe it would be 

taken care of. I think, at this point in time, 

that is too speculative. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, usually we 

think about before constitutionalizing an area 

or extending a constitutional precedent, you 

might disagree with that characterization, but 

before doing that, we usually think about 

whether state law, local law already -- already 

achieves those purposes so that the federal 

courts aren't micromanaging homeless policy. 

And it's -- and it's on a daily basis 

when you work with the homeless. It's a daily

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yeah, no.  For -- for 

the people actually dealing with it day to day, 

that is certainly true, the -- the City, the law 

enforcement, the City liaisons, the nonprofits.

 But it's not true for the federal

 court. The federal court doesn't have to get 

into any of that. The only time the federal 

court would get into it is when -- is if the 

core principle of -- of Robinson was being 

disregarded by not -- by criminalizing somebody 

for sleeping outside when they have no place to 

sleep inside.  That's the core principle. 

That's the only thing a court should be 

enforcing, not the -- not whether people --

whether people show up. 

And the -- the thing I would --

another thing I would say about the necessity 

defense, it -- it may be that if -- if -- if the 

Court issues an appropriate injunction in this 

case or another case limited to the core 

principle of Robinson, but it develops or the 

state law develops that there is a necessity 

defense, then I think that should be taken into

manner, and place or -- or similar to that.

 If state law comes -- comes along and

 establishes a -- a realistic defense or a

 realistic approach to how people can remain in

 the -- in the community, then the courts

 obviously should defer to that.  But we don't 

have that established state law at this time.

 And I don't think the Court should 

decline to address this question, which is 

important in the Ninth Circuit, both because the 

principle that those courts recognize should be 

sustained but the approach they've taken should 

not.

MR. KNEEDLER:  But homeless people are 

resourceful. They have friends who are also

 homeless.  They may -- they may know people in

 town. They may beg for money.

 And the -- the -- the towns are -- are

 coping in the same way, frankly, that individual

 homeless people do.  They do the best they can

 under the circumstances.  But that -- if -- if 

those circumstances fail and the nonprofits, et 

cetera, can't -- you know, the truck doesn't 

show up one night, that doesn't become an Eighth 

Amendment problem. 

And -- and -- and we're by no means 

suggesting that there should be a federal 

judiciary overlay on top of all that.  The 

cities and the nonprofits should be left alone 

to do the work that they're doing, unless the 

core principle of Robinson is not respected.

because, in Robinson and in Powell too, the

 punishment -- you know, the -- the adjudication

 for the punishment to be to imposed, and then

 And Justice Alito was asking you about 

a lot of the very difficult on-the-ground 

factual determinations that law enforcement

 would need to make before deciding whether 

someone could be given a citation for camping 

outdoors.  Why wouldn't it make more sense, 

assuming that we agree in substance with the 

line that Robinson would control here, why 

wouldn't it make more sense for the Eighth 

Amendment claim to be a raised as a defense, 

much like the necessity defense, once a court is 

in a position, unlike the law enforcement 

officer just trying to gather information on the 

ground, to determine whether there were 

available beds, whether the person had a place 

to go? Why is a pre-enforcement challenge the 

right way to think about this?

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- meted out at the end 

of the day. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- I understand 

that. I mean -- let's see -- I do understand 

that, but it's not that it categorically 

prohibits punishing this act.  I mean, as -- as 

one might say if it, you know, prohibited 

sleeping altogether for everyone, right, this is 

because it -- the Eighth Amendment claim is that 

it punishes, criminalizes this act in a way that 

falls disproportionately and unconstitutionally 

on a particular class of people.

And that requires adjudication at the 

front end to figure out whether someone is

 protected or unprotected.  If -- if I go and

 sleep in an encampment, I can be cited. It --

it -- it's different.  There's a factual

 determination on the ground.

 And Robinson was a status-based 

challenge, and it came up in the context of the 

individualized criminal proceeding. So why is a 

pre-enforcement challenge -- why does it make 

sense given the very, very fact-intensive nature 

of this? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, and -- and -- and 

in -- you know, in a -- in a -- in an individual 

case, I think you're right, but imagine a 

situation where someone who genuinely had no 

other place to live and it's the third citation, 

the fourth citation, and -- and the -- you --

you have a pattern as to that person or -- or 

other people where the city is -- is 

consistently not respecting the Robinson 

principle.  Then I think you might have a 

pre-enforcement review, just as you might for an 

asserted violation of some other constitutional 

right because, here, again, it's -- it's not the

interacting with him was not respecting the 

Robinson principle with respect to Robinson

 himself.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  How does the federal

 government do this?  So, in the brief, you

 talked about clearing the encampment at

 McPherson Square.  Can you just describe, I

 mean, in -- briefly if you can, I mean, do 

police then make individualized inquiries?  How 

does this work? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, what happened 

there was the -- you know, was I -- I -- I think 

the gold standard of -- of the way this should 

be done, and -- and larger cities have this 

ability.  This -- the Park Service cooperated 

very closely with the District government.  The 

Park Service does not have the sort of social 

services, et cetera, that a municipality has in 

D.C. And so that function is sort of split. 

These are special National Park properties.  But 

the -- the National Park Service relies, as the 

federal government does, the Federal Protective 

Service for buildings elsewhere, cooperates with 

the local government.

But -- and -- and the local 

government's social service people or the 

nonprofits went out and interviewed everybody 

who was in the -- who was in the encampment at

 McPherson Square and -- and told them about what

 services are available.  There was advance 

notice given that the encampment is going to be

 cleared within I -- I think it was 30 days. And

 people were -- so people were warned 30 days in 

advance.  They were warned the night before, the 

day before, so they could collect their things. 

Some just moved somewhere else.  Some did take 

the -- the city up on the offer. Some went into 

shelters. 

So that -- and that's the way that 

shelters are -- are -- excuse me -- encampments 

are typically cleared, is the -- and 

particularly in -- in cities where you've gotten 

a number of amicus briefs explaining the 

problem.  That's what happens. 

It isn't the -- it isn't the example

enforcement officer for the first time is 

encountering the person.  Smaller cities don't 

have that capability, but Grants Pass does have

greater number of homeless individuals in a

MR. KNEEDLER:  No. That -- that's 

correct.  And one -- one thing that I think is 

important to keep in mind in this is, if Grants 

Pass can do this, so could every other city. So 

could a state do it state-wide.  And, 

eventually, a homeless person would have no 

place to be, lawfully be. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So this is more like 

the sort of initial hypo of criminalizing eating 

outside, not that you'd be doing something that 

was otherwise criminally culpable?

Oregon recently passed statute that I mentioned 

earlier.  Why -- why -- why doesn't the 

government read that law as I do to prevent 

Grants Pass from -- enforcing its ordinances to 

block sleeping outdoors at all places and all 

times? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yeah, no, I -- I -- I 

certainly agree that there appears to be a -- a 

pretty stark inconsistency between that state 

law and the ordinance.  It hasn't been applied. 

It has to be objectively reasonable, I think --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KELSI B. CORKRAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. CORKRAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 Robinson v. California holds that 

status-based punishment schemes are 

categorically cruel and unusual under the Eighth 

Amendment.  The challenged ordinances inflict 

status-based punishment in both effect and 

purpose. 

Although the City describes its 

ordinances as punishing camping on public 

property, it defines campsite as anyplace a 

homeless person is while covered with a blanket. 

The City interprets and applies the ordinances 

to permit non-homeless people to rest on 

blankets in public parks while a homeless person 

who does the same thing breaks the law. 

The ordinances by design make it 

physically impossible for homeless people to 

live in Grants Pass without facing endless fines

and jail time. The only question under Robinson 

is whether there's any meaningful difference

 between a law that says being homeless is 

punishable and a law that says being homeless

 while breathing or sleeping or blinking is

 punishable.

 In other words, does adding a

 universal human attribute to the definition of 

the offense make the punishment conduct-based 

instead of status-based?  The answer is no. The 

purpose and effect of the second statute is 

exactly the same as the first, to make people 

with a status endlessly and unavoidably 

punishable if they don't leave Grants Pass. 

Indeed, all the ordinances do is turn 

the City's homelessness problem into someone 

else's problem by forcing its homeless residents 

into other jurisdictions. 

The injunction below leaves the City 

with an abundance of tools to address 

homelessness.  It can impose time, place, manner 

restrictions on when and where homeless people 

sleep. 

It can ban tents and clear 

encampments.  It can enforce a sleeping ban

against homeless people who decline shelter. 

And it can fully enforce its laws prohibiting

 littering, public urination and defecation, drug 

use, and violent or harassing behavior.

 The only tool the City wants that it 

doesn't have is authority to impose a 24/7

 City-wide sleeping ban that forces its homeless 

residents to either move to another jurisdiction

 or face endless punishment. 

The state police power is broad, but 

it does not include the power to push the 

burdens of social problems like poverty on to 

other communities or the power to satisfy public 

demand by compromising individual constitutional 

rights. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  In Robinson, there 

was a statute that outlawed -- that said that 

"to be addicted" is a crime.  Is there an 

ordinance here that says "to be homeless" is a 

crime? 

MS. CORKRAN: So the language for the 

purposes of a temporary place to live bakes 

homelessness into the -- the definition of the 

offense.  Justice Sotomayor was talking about

that earlier. 

So, when you combine that language

 with the -- the rest of the camping definition, 

what you have is an ordinance that says being 

homeless while sleeping with a blanket is

 punishable. And as I just said earlier, the

 question becomes when you attach the status to

 the universal attribute of -- of sleeping, does

 it then transform the offense into conduct-based 

punishment instead of status-based punishment, 

and I think the answer is no. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A number of 

us, I think, are having difficulty with the 

distinction between status and conduct.  You'll 

acknowledge, won't you, that in -- that those 

terms, there's a difference between being 

addicted to drugs and being homeless? 

In other words, someone who's homeless 

can immediately become not homeless, right, if 

they find shelter. 

Someone who is addicted to drugs, it's 

not so -- so easy. It seems to me that in 

Robinson, it's much easier to understand the 

drug addiction as an ongoing status, while, 

here, I think it is different because you can

move into and out of and into and out of the 

status, as you would put it, as being homeless.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yeah.  So it's

 interesting, we today understand addiction as an

 immutable status.  In Robinson, the Court

 suggested that someone might be -- be recovered

 and no longer have the status of addiction.  So 

the Robinson Court wasn't thinking about 

addiction as something that couldn't change over 

time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that may 

limit the applicability of Robinson to a 

different situation, but what is the -- I mean, 

what is the analytic approach to deciding 

whether something's a status or a situation of 

conduct? 

MS. CORKRAN: So the question is a 

status is something that a person is when 

they're not doing anything.  So being addicted, 

having cancer, being poor, are all statuses that 

you have apart from any conduct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Having cancer 

is not the same as being homeless, right?  I 

mean, maybe I'm just repeating myself because 

homelessness can -- you -- you can remove the

 homeless status in an instant if you move to a

 shelter or situations otherwise change.  And, of 

course, it can be moved the other way as well if 

you're kicked out of the shelter or whatever.

 So that is a distinction from all 

these other things that have been labeled

 status, isn't it?

 MS. CORKRAN: I -- I don't think so 

because, you know, a cancer patient can go into 

remission, they no longer have that status.  I 

don't think -- I mean, I don't think there's any 

question that being poor is a status.  It's 

something you are apart from anything you do. 

It's a status that can change over time, and at 

that point, you wouldn't be a part of the class, 

but I don't think it changes the fact that it is 

a status. 

And what Robinson found so offensive 

about status-based conduct --

 MS. CORKRAN: Violating this ordinance

 means you're homeless.  So, again, homelessness 

is not something you can -- that you do.  It's 

just something that you are.

 And so the question becomes, when you 

attach the universal human attribute of sleeping 

or breathing to that status, does it make the 

punishment conduct-based instead of -- of 

status-based and I -- I think the answer is yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, Edwards 

v. California in 1941 struck down a law that 

made it a crime to transport an indigent person, 

correct? 

MS. CORKRAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Indigency is 

not -- is a condition that can change over time, 

but the law was aimed at the transport of a 

person who wasn't morally reprehensible. 

MS. CORKRAN: Yes.  I think that's 

notable because our history and tradition as a 

country is to emphatically reject any sort of 

local legislative scheme that has the effect of 

pushing the burdens of poverty or indigency into

 So Edwards located it in the Dormant 

Commerce Clause. We have Saenz v. Roe, which 

locates it in the Privileges or Immunities 

Clause; Papachristou addresses that status-based

 punishment in the context of procedural due

 What Robinson held is that when that 

expulsion is effectuated through status-based 

punishment, it violates the Punishments Clause. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  How do you define a

New Jersey has so many tightly woven

homeless shelter with lots of beds right across 

the border 10 minutes away, you know, could that 

be taken into account. 

And I think there was some back and 

forth and not necessarily agreement on that.

 Grants Pass.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yes.  So to -- so to 

answer that hypothetical first, I'm not

 concerned -- I don't have any problems with

 saying that a homeless person in Grants Pass has

 legal and physical access to a shelter that's 

just over the lines if that's, in fact, true.

 Lots of jurisdictions limit their 

homeless shelters to people who are residents. 

So -- and just to be clear, there was no 

suggestion in the record here that there were 

any shelters available outside of Grants Pass. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Understood.  But --

so community doesn't need to be determined by 

jurisdictional lines is what you're telling

MS. CORKRAN: No.

your jurisdiction and on to others.

So -- or out of your community and on 

to others is I think how you -- how you phrased 

it. So I'm asking, how do we know what those

 lines are? And you're saying it doesn't have to

 be jurisdiction-specific.

 MS. CORKRAN: No.  I think 

jurisdiction matters because that tells us kind

 of the lines in which the -- whatever ordinance

 or statute applies.  So, when shelter is 

available, the ordinances are enforceable 

because they punish the conduct of not going to 

the shelter, as opposed to the status of 

homelessness. 

So I think that a -- a municipality 

can punish the conduct of not going to a shelter 

that's just over the line if you have physical 

and legal access to it.  Now, for the reasons 

you say -- and this dates back to our -- our 

settlement system at the Founding Era -- a lot 

of municipalities do not allow people from 

outside of the jurisdiction to use their 

shelters, and so, under those circumstances, the 

shelter wouldn't be legally available.

 You might ask the same questions about 

trespass and squatting in structures if there

 are -- you know, if -- if that was the best

 alternative.  So how do we -- how do we draw

 these difficult lines about, you know, public

 urination and those sorts of things?

 MS. CORKRAN: So I'll start with

 stealing food.  Stealing food is not part of the 

definition of homelessness, and it's also not a 

universal attribute.  So -- so I -- I put that 

outside the scope of any of the arguments we're 

making here. 

With respect to public urination and 

defecation, if you had a -- I don't think this 

would ever exist, but if you had a law that said 

homeless people cannot urinate or defecate 

anywhere within city limits, I -- I think then 

it starts to look like this case. But, if 

you're saying that people can't urinate or 

defecate on public property, it is almost -- it 

-- it's hard to imagine a situation where --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  They have no place 

else to go.  So a homeless person, there --

there's no facilities available, and a homeless

           MS. CORKRAN: Right. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Take my

commercial establishments don't want non-patrons 

coming in to use the facilities, there are no 

public facilities, and it's a generally 

applicable rule that says no public urination. 

MS. CORKRAN: So I think, there, one 

distinction between urination and defecation and 

sleeping is that sleeping outside is part of the 

definition of homelessness, right?  Homelessness 

is lacking a fixed, regular nighttime address. 

So the -- the sleeping prohibition goes more 

directly to the status of homelessness than 

urination or defecation.

so it would not violate the Eighth Amendment to

 MS. CORKRAN: You might come up with 

some different theory, but it's not the theory

 case.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Not the theory that

 you're -- okay.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you think, Ms. 

Corkran, of this idea that Oregon's necessity 

defense essentially functions as an Eighth 

Amendment in this context, so we don't have to 

constitutionalize the kinds of limits that 

you're talking about? 

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah, I would say it's 

not at all clear that that's true.  As Mr. 

Kneedler pointed out, you know, there is a 

necessity defense in Oregon law, but, so far, 

the Oregon courts have not applied it to this 

circumstance.  It also wouldn't necessarily be 

available for the fines, the citations, we have 

here. 

But I think that this question about 

the availability of the necessity defense really 

goes to the injunctive posture of the case.

 It's not going to come up if you're in the --

you know, you're -- if you're presenting the 

Eighth Amendment as an affirmative defense at 

the same time as a necessity defense in a

 criminal prosecution, right, the -- the -- it

 kind of moots out the -- the Eighth Amendment

 claim.

 But going to Justice Barrett's

 questions about injunctive relief, there, the 

question you're asking is, does the plaintiff 

have a credible threat of -- of future 

punishment?  I'd say first that the injunctive 

relief is not before the Court.  The City has 

not challenged the propriety of the in --

injunction here.  So I think it's a question for 

another day. 

The courts here did find that the 

plaintiffs had shown a credible threat of future 

punishment, and so I think that resolves the 

issue for the -- for this case. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, along those 

lines, we -- we haven't mentioned it yet, but in 

the briefing, there's a lot of discussion about 

the fact that Robinson's Eighth Amendment 

holding with respect to status came without any

adversarial testing, wasn't what was argued by 

the parties, it didn't have a whole lot of 

citation or support, it came kind of in a breezy

 paragraph.

 MS. CORKRAN: Right.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And some have

 suggested that that's really a mistake because

 the Eighth Amendment's about punishments.  It

 doesn't prevent states -- limit states' capacity 

to engage in passing laws that make conduct or 

actions or anything a crime.  It just goes to 

the nature of what punishments follow, putting 

aside the Excessive Fines Clause. 

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So there's a lot of 

discussion then in the brief about that and some 

-- some suggestion that, really, it's the 

Fourteenth Amendment that should be doing work 

here, if there is work to be done, because some 

form of the necessity defense has been always 

understood as inhering in due process from the 

founding and whether that can be enforced 

through state laws, which might differ, Kansas 

versus Kahler, but have to -- have to 

nonetheless cover the territory, and whether

 there might be injunctive relief on that basis, 

possible in advance, not limited to defenses,

 possible.

 What -- just reactions to that.  I --

I -- we haven't yet touched on.

 MS. CORKRAN: So Robinson predates

 Graham v. Connor, but I think it -- it espouses

 the same principle, which is, when you can 

identify an explicit textual source for a right, 

you locate the right in that amendment and not 

more generalized notions of due process.  And so 

what the Robinson Court did was they --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, but, here, the 

more -- the more -- the more limited -- I mean, 

let me just --

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- play with that 

for a minute. The more natural home for a 

necessity-type argument is due process. That's 

where it's always historically been understood 

to lie, not the -- not an amendment having to do 

with punishments, right?  One has to do with 

what you can criminalize. The other has to do 

with the punishments that follow.

 is impermissible.

 MS. CORKRAN: Oh, right.

           JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And -- and any

 punishment's impermissible.  And that -- that is

 a necessity defense.  That's a classic necessity

 defense.

 MS. CORKRAN: So I think that it's --

it's right that Robinson describes what it was 

doing as saying that the Eighth Amendment 

prohibited the criminalization.  You see that 

language in I think Weems and Wilkerson v. Utah. 

I -- I agree it seems like a bit of a strange 

fit. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So, if that's the 

case, if -- if that's the case, let me just --

you know, wouldn't that get rid of this awful 

status/conduct distinction that we have -- that 

we're struggling with here today?  Because, if 

it's a necessity, it doesn't matter why it's a 

necessity.  It's in -- it -- it -- every person 

can make their own argument about why it was 

necessary, and then the courts will decide.  We 

don't get into the status/conduct stuff that --

that Robinson seems to invite.  Thoughts?

because that's part of the status. It's

 because, when someone has access to shelter,

 the status.  It's punishing them for the conduct

 of not going --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I asked the

 question --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- because, if 

homelessness is defined as simply lacking a 

place to stay indoors on a particular night, 

then there is an ironclad connection between the 

conduct, which is sleeping outside, and the 

status of homelessness. 

But if homelessness is defined to 

require more than that, then my question would 

be whether someone who is lacking a place to 

stay on a particular night or for a particular 

period of time is homeless if the reason why the 

person finds himself or herself in that status 

is, for example, the person refuses to take 

antipsych -- antipsychotic medicine that's been

might have a shelter or a home where the person

 could live to another place.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yeah.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What about all of

 that?

 MS. CORKRAN: So the status of

 homelessness is something that only changes once 

the person has a home. You lose your home, 

you're homeless.  If you have a home again, then 

you're not in the status anymore. 

I think what your question gets at is 

that second piece, which is whether a person has 

access to shelter.  That can change from day to 

day. And so -- sorry, that's not --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, that's not really 

what my question gets at. The question is you 

can draw a distinction -- status is different 

from conduct, but there are some instances of 

conduct that are closely tied to status or, if 

homelessness is defined as simply lacking a 

place to stay on a particular night, they amount 

to the same thing.  The definition of 

homelessness encompasses the conduct of sleeping 

outside.

So my question is whether this is --

what if the person finds that person in a 

homeless state because of prior life choices or

 the refusal to make future life choices? That's

 the question.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yeah, yeah.  So -- so 

our definition of lacking access to shelter is

 lacking physical or legal access to shelter. 

And you're looking at the person's situation on 

that particular night. 

I think, generally, we're not doing an 

inquiry into all of a person's life choices that 

might have led them to the point where they're 

homeless and can't find a place to sleep. 

Robinson certainly didn't do that sort 

of analysis with respect to addiction, but there 

could be situations where there is such a -- a 

tight causal nexus between a choice a person has 

made and their lack of shelter access that you 

would say this person has chosen not to take the 

shelter and to be very clear, if you decline 

shelter that is physically and legally available 

to you, you're not in our class -- you're in --

 definition that makes the inquiry basically 

tautological, then you get into the question of

 assessing the closeness of the connection 

between the status and the conduct.

 And you do run into problems with the 

person who's a kleptomaniac -- a kleptomaniac or 

a person who suffers from -- pedophilia.  So how

 do you distinguish that?  How does the Court 

assess how close the connection has to be? 

MS. CORKRAN: So -- so, for both of 

those categories, the -- the -- the status is 

defined -- I don't know if status is the right 

word there -- being a pedophilia or having 

pedophilia is defined by the urge that you have, 

not by your conduct, and acting on that urge. 

So, if someone were to act on that 

urge, in a -- that tight causal nexus on why 

they didn't have access to shelter, then they 

would be outside of our claim. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I thought you made a 

very interesting remark in response to Justice 

Alito, and I'm just trying to clarify. 

You seem to say that homelessness, as 

you've defined it, is not lacking access to 

shelter on a particular night.

 MS. CORKRAN: That's right.  We're

 use -- I use the HUD definition, which is that 

homelessness means you lack a fixed, regular,

 adequate nighttime address. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: So that kind of

 thing might -- going back to the Chief Justice's

 original question, that's not changing night to

MS. CORKRAN: No, I mean --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- in the same way. 

MS. CORKRAN: -- it can change over 

time in the same way that a cancer diagnosis 

could change over time, or -- but --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And then the other 

part that was interesting to me is that assuming 

that's your definition, homelessness lacking a 

fixed regular address, it -- when someone does 

have access to a shelter even though they lack a 

fixed regular address, the ordinance in that 

situation, I thought you said, is operating to 

punish the act of not going to the shelter --

MS. CORKRAN: Yes.

punishing the status of being homeless.

MS. CORKRAN: Yes, that's -- that's

 the exact reason that reasonable time, place, 

manner restrictions aren't a problem because, if 

you have time, manner -- time, place, and manner

 restrictions, what you're doing is punishing the 

conduct of not going to sleep where you're

 allowed to go. That rationale doesn't work when 

someone has nowhere to go.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And can you speak to 

whether or not we should really be even getting 

into this in light of the new Oregon law? 

MS. CORKRAN: So we didn't argue 

mootness.  We made this point in our brief in 

opposition.  We didn't say mootness just because 

we don't have an injunction under the Oregon law 

yet and it's not self-executing. 

I don't think there is any question 

that the ordinances fall under the Oregon law. 

I mean, it was intended to codify Martin. It 

requires that any sort of restrictions on 

sleeping or resting outside are reasonable with 

respect to homeless individuals. 

Clearly, the ordinances here don't 

meet that standard.  So I -- I -- I certainly 

wouldn't have any concerns with the Court

 To -- to get to the mental health

 hypothetical, if a person -- if the person's

 mental health issues made the shelter either

 physically unavailable to them because, if they 

went there, they would be at substantial risk of 

bodily harm or death, then I would say the

You could also have a shelter that 

won't take people with mental health problems,

I would say that if the shelter is

MS. CORKRAN: So it was determined

 based on the declarations and depositions of

 the -- the putative class members and named

 plaintiffs.  It also, you know, we've talked a 

little about the ratio between beds to

 population.

 The Ninth Circuit ended up rejecting

 that as a hard-and-fast rule, but the lack of

 shelter beds in Grants Pass provides credibility 

to the putative class members' declarations when 

they say they have nowhere to go. 

I'd also say I don't understand the 

City to have ever contested that the named 

plaintiffs are homeless.  What they contested is 

whether they had access to shelter --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I -- I think what's 

confusing me is that when I read the ordinance, 

the ordinance is an anti-camping ordinance. 

Would this -- would a -- would a backpacker who 

happens to be in the area for a few days be 

allowed to camp on -- on public property? 

MS. CORKRAN: I don't -- I think 

theoretically no, but I would say that the City 

has never -- it was not able to identify any

 MS. CORKRAN: So I -- I -- it would

 depend on the circumstances.  The line that the

 police officers drew in their depositions was,

 if they saw a non-homeless person lying on a 

blanket, they wouldn't enforce the ordinance.

we've made that argument. It certainly a theme

 across the amici briefs.  I would -- just on the 

incentivizing, I think, is a non sequitur 

because the only question here is whether it

 violates the Eighth Amendment to enforce the 

ordinances when someone has no access to

 shelter, when they're turning down the services.

 So that's a circumstance we're looking at. 

Maybe -- I think what Your Honor's 

question gets at is our discussion of no 

penological purpose.  This Court has recognized 

that when a punishment scheme has no penological 

purpose, it inflicts gratuitous suffering, and 

that is cruel and unusual punishment. 

And I will say, at this point, the 

City has not ever identified any penological 

purpose for punishing homeless people who do not 

have access to shelter.  If you ask that 

question, every time they pivot to encampments 

and fires and sanitation problems, which are all 

non-sequiturs. As I've said a number of times, 

this case is only about sleeping outside when 

there's no shelter available.  And so I think 

that lack of penological purpose is significant.

MS. CORKRAN: -- that's flatly wrong.

 I mean, I -- I'll go back to my opening. I gave 

the whole list of the things that the City is 

allowed to do under the ordinance and under our 

claim. The only thing that they cannot do is 

impose a 24/7 sleeping ban that makes it 

impossible for homeless people to stay in the 

jurisdiction. 

I'd also note, you know, they have a 

lot of amicus briefs on their side from local 

governments. Almost the entirety of what those 

amicus briefs are complaining about isn't at 

issue in this case.  So, when you have 

injunctions against encampments, that's under 

the Fourth Amendment.  We don't have a Fourth 

Amendment claim.  A lot of the injunctions are 

under the Fourteenth Amendment, including the 

San Rafael one that the City identifies in its

This case is worlds away from

any of the questions that we've been discussing

unanswerable. 

First, I'd like to start with the 

United States' position.  That would also bring 

chaos. It would be a disaster if Martin were to 

remain on the books in any form. It does not 

make a difference if the inquiry is 

pre-enforcement or post-enforcement.  All the

 choices are, how they are there, whether the 

shelter that's available is adequate, where it 

is, what rules it has, all of that.

 And I'd like to clarify how all of 

this works in practice because it would be 

impossible for people on the ground to 

understand and predict what a court would say 

about the shelters that are available and the 

alternatives that are available and the choices 

that were made and the difficulty of all that. 

So, here, how it works is, under the 

Grants Pass policy -- I'll direct the Court to 

page 155 of the Joint Appendix.  There, it says, 

officers are required to give a 24-hour notice 

before issuing a citation. 

So I -- I want to just focus on that 

for a moment.  How will the officer know when --

when she or he comes back whether the individual 

has another place to go? There's no way to know 

the answer to that.  So they would have to take 

their word for it perhaps.  So it would lead to 

all of those same problems. 

And it is hyperbole -- the other side

years. There's nothing like that going on here.

 They talk about an isolated statement from a 

community meeting that was a three-hour meeting.

 There are 20 pages of minutes.  It's one

 sentence.  What that full context shows is a

 wide-ranging discussion about all of these

 difficult policy problems and how the City was

 trying to incentivize people to accept shelter 

and dealing with a small group that was causing 

serious problems and crime in the City, and 

they're trying to balance those who wouldn't 

take the help with the City's needs to keep 

their public spaces open. 

When the Ninth Circuit 

constitutionalized this area, it left cities 

with really no choice: Either keep building 

enough shelter that may or may not be adequate 

or suitable to someone's preferences, or be 

forced to give up all of your public spaces. 

That is what's happened. We've seen a -- a 

suspension of enforcement of these basic laws 

that are so important. 

The line-drawing problems are 

never-ending. That is exactly why Powell, 

Justice Gorsuch, to your point about Powell and

the plurality there said that if we embark on 

this journey and we start constitutionalizing 

laws that address conduct, the line-drawing

 problems will be endless.  And so that is a

 reason not to extend Robinson here.

 So I -- I just want to make, again,

 our basic Eighth Amendment point here, which is 

that these are low-level fines and very short 

jail terms for repeat offenders that are in 

effect in many other jurisdictions.  This is not 

unusual in any way. It is certainly not cruel. 

And we can just point to our appendix in our 

reply that goes through jurisdictions from West 

Hollywood, California, to Watertown, 

Massachusetts, that have the same type of 

policies.  So the policy questions in this case 

are very difficult, and I think that's what has 

come across today. 

The Eighth Amendment question, though, 

is not.  Here, the punishments are the sorts of 

punishments that have been held to be 

permissible for -- since the founding and really 

are in use today. They're not in any way 

unusual. 

So we -- we heard a lot of things

about guessing how this would work in practice, 

but it sounds to me like courts would need to 

have some sort of rules so that they could tell 

a jurisdiction like Chico that the place it set

 aside for camping was adequate when the federal

 court said no, it wasn't, because it's outdoors, 

or a San Clemente that was threatened with 

lawsuits because it didn't provide cell phone 

chargers in the area that it designated for 

camping, or San Rafael, where the court said 

that 200 feet between encampments -- between 

tents was too much and that 100 feet was the 

maximum under the Eighth Amendment. 

So, for all of those reasons, the 

Court should reverse. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted.
