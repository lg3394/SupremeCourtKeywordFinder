 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-807, Alexander

 versus the South Carolina State Conference of

 the NAACP.

 Mr. Gore.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. GORE

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 

MR. GORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

District 1 is not a racial 

gerrymander.  Rather, the General Assembly 

largely preserved District 1 from the 

constitutional benchmark plan and made changes 

based on traditional criteria and politics.  The 

panel acknowledged that the General Assembly 

pursued a political goal of increasing District 

1's Republican vote share.  It achieved that 

goal by moving Republicans into the district and 

Democrats out of the district.  All of the 

direct evidence confirms that it used political 

data, not racial data, to identify Republicans 

and Democrats. 

The panel declared District 1 a racial

gerrymander only by departing from this Court's 

precedents and adopting sua sponte, an erroneous

 racial target theory.

 First, the panel failed to enforce the

 alternative map requirement.  In a 

circumstantial case like this, only such an

 alternative can disentangle race and politics.

 Second, the panel's racial target

 theory hyper-entangled race and politics and 

simply makes no sense.  The panel believed the 

General Assembly needed a racial target in 

Charleston County to achieve its political goal 

district-wide.  But a 17 percent racial target 

says nothing about voter turnout, says nothing 

whatsoever about the predominant majority of 

voters in predominantly white Charleston County, 

and also is irreconcilable with District 1's 

recent electoral history. 

Moreover, even the panel agreed that 

the General Assembly made political changes in 

other parts of District 1 without using a racial 

target.  The General Assembly had no reason to 

and did not use a racial target. It used 

political data to pursue its political goals. 

If left uncorrected, the decision

below will undermine this Court's holding that 

partisan gerrymandering claims are not

 justiciable.  Partisan gerrymandering claims can 

always be repackaged as racial gerrymandering 

claims if all plaintiffs in lower courts have to 

do is ignore direct evidence of intent, infer a

 racial target from the correlation between race 

and politics, and point to malleable expert

 analysis. 

This Court should reverse and not 

allow its exacting precedents to be so easily 

subverted. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Gore, we review 

this for clear error. And the district court 

credited the plaintiffs' expert and found your 

experts non-credible. So how does that meet the 

clear error standard? 

MR. GORE: The Court will proceed to 

clear error if it rejects our legal arguments, 

but let me turn to Dr. Ragusa first.  All three 

of Dr. Ragusa's opinions raised in this appeal 

contradict his own data and conclusions in his 

initial report, which actually demonstrated that 

race did not predominate in the enacted plan's

changes to District 1.

 His own data showed that politics was 

a stronger predictor than race of whether a VTD

 was moved out of District 1.  He also concluded 

that there was no statistically significant 

correlation between race and whether VTDs were

 moved into District 1. That's at page 187 of 

the Joint Appendix and page 514 of our

 jurisdictional appendix. 

So those facts alone establish that 

Dr. Ragusa's three opinions at issue in this 

appeal are unreliable and unprobative. 

But there's even more. For each of 

those three opinions, Dr. Ragusa committed other 

errors.  He did not control for VTD location or 

proximity to the district line.  He also did not 

control for where in the district voters live. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I 

thought -- I thought he said that as far as 

geographic contiguity, that the -- the size of 

the different districts was a adequate proxy for 

that. 

MR. GORE: He did say that traditional 

principles were embedded in his analysis, but 

whatever he meant by that, he did also admit on

 cross-examination that he didn't test or control

 for those principles and whether they explained

 the decisions the General Assembly actually

 made.

 That's the same error that the experts 

made in Allen that this Court set aside just 

last term. His failure to consider the location

 of VTDs and voters within the district is the

 same error that was committed by the expert in 

Cromartie II, where this Court reversed a 

finding of racial gerrymandering under the clear 

error standard. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Did your expert 

present an alternative study which did control 

for geography and reached a different result? 

MR. GORE: He did not try to mirror 

Dr. Ragusa's study --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because that would 

have been the easiest way to undermine the

for geography. The results are entirely

 different.

 MR. GORE: We did raise objections to

 Dr. Ragusa's methodology, and as I was 

explaining, it is a flawed methodology and not

 reliable.

 Moreover, the state presented direct

 testimony from the map drawer to explain which

 VTDs were chosen and why.  That direct evidence 

showed, like all the other direct evidence, that 

decisions were made based on politics and 

traditional principles and not using race at 

all. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think you end up 

in a very poor starting point under clear error 

arguing the substance of believability of one 

expert over another, because credibility 

findings under clear error standard must be 

deferred to -- to the district court. 

I understand your points about -- your 

point about Dr. Ragusa, but I just point out 

that other experts before the court and he 

himself said that geography was very much 

embedded as part of the structure of his 

analysis.

You may disagree with that.  It's

 going to be very hard for you to show that no 

fact finder could credit that understanding of

 his testimony.

 But I think what I'm really troubled 

by is, going back to Justice Thomas's question, 

what's the legal error and what's the clear

 error? Just tick them off for me.

 MR. GORE: There are several legal 

errors, Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not facts.  I want 

legal errors or clear errors beyond -- under our 

standard. 

MR. GORE: The first legal error is a 

failure to enforce the alternative map 

requirement. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  I'm going to 

butt in.  And I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, you can --

you can start there. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The alternative map 

requirement, I -- I mean, doesn't exist.  You 

know, sometimes this Court, I think, holds 

things, and then I go back to the opinion and I

might have been.  Not here.

 I'm just going to read from -- from

 Cooper:  "A plaintiff's task is simply to 

persuade the trial court -- without any special

 evidentiary prerequisite -- that race (not

 politics) was the predominant consideration ...

 in no area of our equal protection law have we 

forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form 

of proof to prevail. Nor would it make sense to 

do so here ... an alternative map is merely an 

evidentiary tool ... neither its presence nor 

its absence can itself resolve a racial 

gerrymandering claim." 

I don't know how to more clearly say 

that there is no alternative map requirement in 

these kinds of cases. 

MR. GORE: Cooper was directed -- was 

addressing a case where there was direct 

evidence of racial predominance. It also said 

on page 322 in the majority opinion: In a case 

like Cromartie II -- that is, one in which the 

plaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a 

racial gerrymander and needed to rely on 

evidence of forgone alternatives -- only maps of 

that kind could carry the day.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  All we were saying 

there, Mr. Gore, is that in a case with no other

 evidence, you needed some evidence.  So that is

 not this case.  Cromartie II was making a very

 case-specific point, look at this case, there's

 none -- none of this kind of evidence, there's 

none of that kind of evidence, there's none of

 the other kind of evidence.  So, my gosh, in 

that case, you needed a map. 

But this is case by case, all we were 

saying is that when you have no other evidence, 

you better present a map. But that's not to say 

that there's anything like an alternative map 

requirement.  If you make your case some other 

way, that's good enough. 

And, here, the Court found, again, on 

a clear error standard, that the plaintiffs made 

their case some other way. 

MR. GORE: But -- even if that's the 

correct reading of Cooper, Justice Kagan, there 

were still other legal errors in how the panel 

conducted its analysis.

argument was that at least as a practical 

matter, in a case in which there is no direct

 evidence or virtually no direct evidence, there 

is no way in which a plaintiff can disentangle

 race and politics, except by providing an

 alternative map.  I thought that was your legal

 argument.

 MR. GORE: That is.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that's exactly 

what Cooper says is not the case. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, one may read 

Cooper a different way.  Cooper was a case in 

which there was a lot of direct evidence, was 

there not? 

MR. GORE: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, let me ask 

you, how could there be direct evidence really 

in this kind of case?  So this is what I'm a 

little concerned about because, to the extent 

that this distinction's turning on whether or 

not there is direct evidence, I wonder if it is 

reasonable to require such evidence or -- or say 

that such evidence would exist in a situation 

that is not a majority-majority -- a 

majority-minority district scenario.

You can see how there would be direct 

evidence when the state's goal is to try to, in

 its view, comply with the VRA, they're trying to

 make a majority-minority district, so we're 

going to have some evidence of people saying

 that.

 But, in a situation like this, where 

that is not the case, where the state is saying 

instead, we are trying to, you know, achieve a 

partisan tilt, I guess I don't understand --

and, excuse me, we've also said that its, you 

know, intent to use race is a very hard thing to 

prove just on its own. 

Are you asking that we have the 

smoking gun in a situation like this? 

MR. GORE: Not at all, Justice 

Jackson.  As you pointed out, of course, in 

majority-minority district contexts, there's 

often direct evidence of a use of race and even 

of race predominating. 

You could also have that in another 

context if the map-drawer or some key legislator 

admitted to using race as a proxy for politics 

because they didn't have adequate election data 

or --

 requiring that?  Could we ever -- could we ever 

make this showing on circumstantial evidence

 alone? I -- there were some amicus briefs 

related to computer drawings and that sort of

 thing that they thought would be particularly

 helpful in this context.

 MR. GORE: The -- the alternative map

 itself would perform that requirement because, 

if race predominated over politics, then any 

alternative map can be drawn that preserves the 

political outcome the General Assembly was 

seeking while removing the alleged racial 

effect. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Putting that 

aside, there were alternative maps here that 

showed that if race wasn't used, the map would 

not look like this.  So it didn't show what 

you're saying.  But we go back, let's assume, 

let's move back past the map because I think 

Cooper was petulantly clear that you don't need

 do that here.  Senator Campsen testified --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the legal 

error, is that they didn't correctly weigh the

 evidence?

 MR. GORE: They didn't correctly

 conduct the inquiry.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because that sounds 

like a factual error to me. I mean, your brief 

basically, you know, says we have legal errors, 

and then it says, well, the evidence didn't 

show. 

Those are factual errors.  That's 

subject to the clear error standard, going back 

to Justice Thomas's question. 

MR. GORE: To the extent we've also 

made a clear error argument, I agree, but we've 

pointed out that the district court failed to 

properly apply the standards that this Court 

required in Cooper. 

Cooper could not have been clearer on 

that point that the district court is required 

to weigh all the direct and circumstantial 

evidence of intent to ensure that plaintiffs 

have disentangled race and politics.

They also were required to presume the

 good faith of the General Assembly and its 

explanation for what it did in the lines that it 

drew. But the panel failed to do both of those

 things.  There was mountains of direct and

 circumstantial --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that just sounds

 to me as though you have a different view of the

 evidence, that you think, well, the evidence 

showed that we were just doing politics.  And 

the court said no, the evidence showed that you 

were doing race as a proxy for politics. 

And, surely, there were good reasons 

to do race as a proxy for politics here.  I 

mean, if you look at what information the map-

drawers had on their computer, the information 

the map-drawers had on their computer was a 

single presidential election year voting data 

and then lots of race data. 

And everybody can tell you that if you 

really want to draw a stable partisan 

gerrymander, you do not rely on a single 

presidential year election data. I mean, they 

had not only the opportunity, it was sitting 

there on their computers, but the clear

 incentive to be looking at this race data, which 

is certainly more predictive of future voting

 behavior than a single presidential year 

election in which President Trump was the 

candidate, which further distorts voting

 behavior.

 MR. GORE: We -- we totally disagree 

with that reading of the record. The panel 

itself did not call into question the 

reliability of the General Assembly's election 

data. It, in fact, used that election -- very 

election data to support its racial target 

theory. 

So, if that election data is 

unreliable, the panel's entire line of reasoning 

is unreliable.  All of the unrebutted direct 

evidence established that the map-drawing team 

thought that that evidence was reliable and 

actually used it to draw lines. 

Now, on the question of whether racial 

data --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There was evidence 

that they looked at it.  There was evidence that 

it went into their analysis.  But, I mean -- I

what the panel said was that there was also 

plenty of evidence that they looked at the 

voting record and not just as a legal check on 

the back end. Nobody needs to have the voting

 records on your computer as you draw the maps in

 order to make a legal check.

 What they were basically doing was to

 make sure that the population of blacks in each 

precinct, in each district, you know, did not 

rise above the -- the -- the -- the number which 

would make the Republican gerrymander less 

stable. 

MR. GORE:  That -- that's not what the 

evidence was at trial.  The evidence was that 

the racial data is embedded in the software but 

that the map-drawer would have to scroll over to 

a different screen or down to the bottom in 

order to be able to see it. 

I'd also --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Gore, is there --

is there anything suspicious about the fact that 

a map-drawer knows the racial demographics of 

the state or has available the racial 

demographics of the state?  Haven't we spoken 

about that?

district court's error in failing to look at all

 the evidence.  It's true the map-drawer knew the

 racial composition of one precinct, one VTD.  He 

didn't know the racial composition of other VTDs 

the district court asked him about, but he did 

know the political composition of those VTDs and

 testified to that at trial. 

Moreover, racial data is not a good 

predictor of partisan outcomes because racial 

data doesn't measure turnout or voting behavior

 above that, we're not sure we can hold this when

 another election comes.

 MR. GORE: The record did not support

 that finding --

JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, let me ask

 you, what's the --

MR. GORE: -- and it was infected by

 legal error. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  How -- how do you 

explain the consistency? 

I mean, my understanding is that 

thousands of people were moved in and out of 

this district, and yet that line, the line 

concerning the amount of, you know, black 

voter -- adult voter participation remained the 

same. So, if that was not -- if -- if what the 

court found here was not happening, how do you 

explain the consistency of that line? 

MR. GORE: We have a few explanations 

for that, Justice Jackson. 

So the first, to address Justice 

Kagan's hypothetical, is that the BVAP in draft

 MR. GORE: But the racial effects in 

this plan are far less stark than the racial 

effects in the Cromartie and Cromartie II plan,

 where this Court reversed a finding of racial

 gerrymandering.  So, for example, in Cromartie 

II, the line split a county and created a 

72 percent BVAP area in one county and a 

10 percent BVAP area in the other district.

 panel itself relied on that data. The direct 

evidence is that everyone relied on that data. 

Racial data does not predict election outcomes

 particularly effectively.  The correlation

 between race and politics only affects election

 outcomes to the extent people turn out and vote. 

But racial data doesn't measure that; only

 election data measures that.

           Their own expert, Dr. Duchin, agreed 

with that.  Dr. Duchin said that racial data 

could not be used to predict election outcomes 

because you have to know about turnout, you have 

to know about crossover voting and other 

factors. 

Their own brief at page 10 concedes 

that racial data would not predict voting 

behavior turnout among white voters in the area 

covered by District 1. The reason for that is 

that white voters in that area split between 

Trump and Biden in 2020, and that district and 

even Charleston County are predominantly white. 

So using a racial target in that area wouldn't 

have told you about what the vast majority of 

voters were going to do. 

So it's not an effective way to

-- but there's some expert that said the

 absentee -- a consultant said, I believe it was,

 that the absentee ballots in the presidential 

data weren't properly allocated. What's the 

response to that? 

MR. GORE: That -- that's completely 

incorrect.  They're citing testimony from Mr. 

Oldham, who was involved in drawing the Senate 

plan, not the congressional plan.  He said that, 

hypothetically, election data would be flawed if 

it didn't do that, but he didn't know one way or 

the other whether the General Assembly's 

election data did do that. 

And, in fact, the testimony, 

unrebutted at trial, on the data itself shows 

that the absent -- that the election data the 

General Assembly used did properly allocate both 

the absentee ballots back to the precincts and 

other votes down to the census block level.  So

Moreover, even though 2020 is a

 Mr. Gore.  If I could move to a 30,000-foot 

perspective, how do you understand what we're 

supposed to do in evaluating clear error?

 I mean, we have just an appendices in

 are a hundred different factual determinations. 

If we think 15 of them are wrong, do we reverse 

for clear error in that -- in that situation?

it take more?  We don't normally review -- other 

than in these cases, we don't normally review a

MR. GORE: Even one clear error can be 

sufficient if it leaves the Court with a 

definite and firm conviction that an error was 

made below.  And, here, we've pointed to many 

errors in the district court's analysis, both

 Cromartie II.  In Cromartie II, the Court 

reviewed the record and determined that clear

 error had been committed and therefore reversed

 a finding of -- of a three-judge panel of racial

 predominance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we just

 give different degrees of the importance of

 particular facts and weigh those --

MR. GORE: We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in 

reviewing the entire record? 

MR. GORE: Yes, and we've -- we've 

tried in our brief to show what we think are the 

most important factual errors made by the 

district court.  There's no direct evidence of 

any racial target.  In fact, all the direct 

evidence points the other way.  And the panel 

didn't even mention any of that. 

There's also the -- their own 

alternative plans.  Even if there's no 

alternative map requirement in this particular 

case, their own alternative maps fail to 

disentangle race and politics because they all 

turn District 1 into a majority Democratic 

district.  That's actually evidence that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 Justice Thomas?

 Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the clear error 

standard, if that's the standard that we are 

required to apply, is a very demanding standard, 

but it is not an impossible standard, and it 

doesn't mean that we simply rubber-stamp 

findings by a district court, particularly in a 

case like this, where we are the only court that 

is going to be reviewing those findings and 

particularly in a case in which the -- the basis 

for a judgment in favor of the prevailing party 

relies very heavily, if not entirely, on expert 

reports, the methodology of which can be 

examined. 

So, in light of that, I want to ask 

you about a -- an alleged flaw in Dr. Ragusa's 

analysis that you mention on page 21 of your 

reply brief, and Dr. Ragusa's expert report may 

turn out to be crucial in this case because --

 failed to control for partisanship?

 MR. GORE: That is -- that is correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So you say 

on page 31 that Dr. Ragusa's analysis is flawed 

because it "used total numbers instead of

 percentages for VTDs' racial and political

 compositions."

 That's what I understand you're 

saying, is that in determining whether a VTD was 

moved out or moved in for a political reason, as 

opposed to -- for a racial reason, as opposed to 

a political reason, Dr. Ragusa looked only to 

the number of votes cast for President Biden in 

those districts. 

Is that -- is that the problem, rather 

than the net Biden vote over the Trump vote? 

MR. GORE: That -- that's one of the 

problems, yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you just explain 

that problem? 

MR. GORE: Yes. It was clear at trial 

-- and the panel even relied upon this in its 

discussion of Mr. Roberts' testimony -- that the 

total number is not as relevant as the

 percentage in determining the effect of moving a 

VTD because VTDs are of different sizes. And 

so, when you move a total number, it doesn't 

tell you as much as the percent composition 

either racially or politically in terms of how 

that affects the total composition of a

 district. 

The other problem that we pointed out 

in our brief with that particular analysis is it 

contradicts Dr. Ragusa's own data from his 

initial report.  His own data in the initial 

report showed that politics was a stronger 

predictor than race as to whether VTDs were 

moved out, and it -- he also concluded that 

there was no statistically significant 

correlation to race in terms of VTDs being moved 

into District 1. 

So he arrived at this contrary 

conclusion only by jerry-rigging his analysis. 

He didn't consider traditional districting 

principles, he didn't consider VTD or voter 

location, he committed this error about 

percentages, and he also didn't consider VT --

he lumped these VTDs together in very broad 

categories, and so they were dissimilar -- it

 Am I correct that he is -- he is

MR. GORE: And let me correct one 

thing that I said.  I believe Dr. Liu also 

claimed to be controlling for partisanship.  But 

Dr. Liu used a flawed VTD data set in his 

analysis, so his analysis of the enacted plan's 

VTD moves is also flawed. 

The -- the Joint Appendix at 142 to 

144 illustrates the magnitude of that flaw.  He 

thought there were -- his data set told him 

there were 91 split VTDs in the enacted plan. 

That's seven times more than there actually

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, on each

 expert, you take potshots and say they failed to

 never required one perfect expert to testify to 

all aspects of a case, but I worry that your 

methodology is going to suggest that what we do 

now is do exactly that and instead of looking at 

the gestalt, which is what the district court 

did, not the gestalt, but the whole picture. 

So you discount all four of the 

plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Ragusa, but there were 

three others.  Two of the experts accounted for 

partisanship but not geography, and two others 

accounted for geography but not partisanship. 

There's no rule that requires one expert to do 

all of it. 

And even with Dr. Ragusa, his purpose 

for his choices were not your purposes.  His 

purposes for his choices were to show that VTDs 

with a particular percentage of blacks were 

going to be selected over white districts, and

 So I'm wondering, where would the

 clear error standard come in for us to be doing 

what Justice Alito did in picking one factor and 

saying this is a critical flaw that can't be 

made up by the circumstantial evidence around it 

from all other three experts?

 MR. GORE: Two responses on that.

 Actually, three maybe, Justice Sotomayor. 

The first is that this is supposed to 

be a demanding burden for plaintiffs, and so 

this kind of analysis of the evidence they 

actually put forward is exactly what this Court 

did in Cromartie II when it recognized that the 

clear error standard is informed by the 

demanding burden of proof that the plaintiffs 

bore below. 

And in Cromartie II, the Court 

rejected an --

from this looking at all four experts and 

looking at other cases where we've accepted that 

expert testimony even with the pointed-out 

flaws, does that defeat your argument?

the four experts that they put forward in this

MR. GORE: Don't know that those 

particular experts came before the Court, but 

they made exactly the same error -- committed 

exactly the same errors in this case that they 

committed in Allen that led this Court to set 

aside their analyses, in particular and -- and 

even more so here because they failed to

 disentanglement question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And just to continue 

in Justice Sotomayor's line of questioning, you 

have two experts here, Ragusa and Liu, who 

answer the exact question that is supposed to be 

answered in such a case. In other words, is 

this gerrymander based on politics, or is it a 

way to get to an ultimate goal, an ultimate 

political goal, but the gerrymandering is based 

on race? 

And what the two of them do is that 

they show that black Democrats are excluded from 

District 1 at a far greater percentage than 

white Democrats are. 

So, you know, Liu says, what is it, 

61 percent -- now I'm going to lose it --

69 percent of white Democrats were -- were --

remained in the district, whereas only 

51 percent of black Democrats did.  Ragusa's 

analysis, similarly clear, a little bit harder 

to state in one sentence. 

But -- but both experts essentially 

said: Look, we've done these regressions, and 

we can show you that black Democrats and white

 Democrats are not being treated the same way, 

that black Democrats are being excluded for the

 district at a far greater proportion.

 So, you know, every regression 

analysis has things that you can poke holes in, 

but you didn't give anything in response to

 that. It's not like you said:  We have a better

 regression analysis.  We've controlled for more 

things and we can show you that the -- that the 

effect disappears. 

You're saying that it was clear error 

to credit the plaintiffs' experts dealing with 

the exact question under review and finding 

statistically significant results, to credit 

those experts over your nothing. 

MR. GORE: Over our direct evidence, 

which the panel didn't even mention.  Those 

experts had flawed methodology.  I already 

talked about Dr. Liu's VTD data set.  The panel 

didn't even cite to Dr. Liu in its opinion 

because the glaring error and glaring flaw in 

his VTD set became so clear on 

cross-examination.  So Dr. Liu's completely out 

of the case because his VTD data set was 

worthless.  And the district court knew that and

didn't even cite to Dr. Liu in the opinion.

 Dr. Ragusa's regression analysis at 

one point also used an inapt political number 

because he used an average Democratic vote 

number rather than the actual number, and he 

compared that to the actual African American

 number.  That's at pages 506 and 509 of the

 Joint Appendix.

 So, yes, it was clear error to rely on 

clearly erroneous and unreliable expert 

testimony and to use that to override a mountain 

of direct evidence, both looking at Charleston 

County and district-wide, that established that 

the plan achieved the General Assembly's 

political goal uniquely among all the plans 

presented at trial and that it complied with 

traditional districting principles both in 

Charleston County and in District 1 

district-wide, again, uniquely among all the 

alternatives presented at trial. 

That -- that's the -- if that's not 

the definition of clear error, then I don't know 

what is. And if that's not the definition of 

departing from the presumption of good faith and 

the requirement of extraordinary caution, then

 sure you have a chance to summarize the evidence 

as you see it of why Charleston County was split 

the way it was split. 

MR. GORE:  Thank -- thank you, Justice 

Kavanaugh. 

So, first of all, it was done for 

political reasons because, of course, it was 

part and parcel of achieving the district -- the 

goal, the political goal, district-wide.  The 

big -- the most significant move that the 

enacted plan made was in Charleston County. It 

moved the West Ashley neighborhood from District 

1 to District 6. 

That was over 80,000 of the 140,000 

people that were moved from District 1 to 

District 6. West Ashley is a close-in suburb of 

Charleston.  It is majority Democratic but also 

predominantly white.  We've given the figures in 

our brief that show that that move in particular

had a much greater impact on the political 

composition of District 1 than its racial

 composition.  So that move, which is over half 

of the people involved, is itself more easily

 explained by politics than by race.

 The line in Charleston County actually 

improved compliance with traditional districting 

principles compared to the benchmark plan. The 

benchmark plan had five split VTDs in Charleston 

County.  The enacted plan fixed all of those. 

The enacted plan also followed natural 

geographic boundaries in Charleston County, such 

as rivers, which are very significant methods of 

transportation and commerce in a -- in a county 

like Charleston that's coastal. 

It also achieved Senator Campsen's 

policy goal, which was to keep two 

representatives in Charleston County to 

represent the county's interests here in 

Washington, D.C.

Charleston County because Congressman Clyburn is 

one of the most powerful Democrats in the

 Congress, and what Senator Campsen explained is 

that Joe Biden wouldn't be president if it 

weren't for Congressman Clyburn. So, of course, 

he wants Congressman Clyburn representing the

 interests of his home county of Charleston.  But 

he also wanted to keep a Republican 

representative there too in case there's a 

change in administration here in Washington. 

Congressman Clyburn's own draft map 

kept a split in Charleston County because he 

wanted to keep a portion of Charleston County in 

his district as well. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What was the black

 race and partisanship.

 I understood your brief to say, but

 you haven't said this yet that I heard, so I 

want to make sure I understand it correctly, 

that he did not take into account factors like 

contiguousness and compactness, and so he was 

assuming that you could have essentially kind of 

an island cut off in the middle of the district 

that would have more black voters, which would 

obviously then not be contiguous. 

Am I misunderstanding that? 

MR. GORE: That -- that's correct for 

his county envelope analysis, yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MR. GORE: And what he also didn't do 

is the other piece of that, is control or test 

for traditional principles.  That's on page 197 

of the Joint Appendix. 

And what we mean by that is it would 

be possible to draw different lines for District 

1 in a county, take Charleston County or 

Dorchester, which are both split.  But, if you 

want to go out and grab that other VTD, you have 

to make tradeoffs elsewhere because, if you're

 changing the shape of the district or picking up

 additional population from other VTDs, you have

 to offset that somewhere else.

 And so what a properly done analysis 

does, as this Court recognized in Allen, would 

test whether the decisions that were made are 

more or less consistent with traditional

 principles than the decisions the expert is

 proposing.  And Dr. Ragusa doesn't do that here 

because he doesn't control for traditional 

principles like contiguity. 

And his analysis is different than the 

analysis that was done and this Court credited 

in Cooper because of the thing I mentioned 

before about his regression analysis using only 

an average political number rather than the 

actual political number in each VTD. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And how much of a 

point did you make of that in the district 

court?

raised a lot of objections to Dr. Ragusa and his

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, can I drill 

down on that a little bit? Because I think

 that's at the heart of one of my concerns about 

the burdens and some of the questions that we've

 heard.

 So you put on Mr. Trende at the 

district court, and my understanding was that 

Mr. Trende did not really, as an expert, 

undercut the methodologies of Ragusa and the 

other experts.  Is that -- is that correct?  I 

mean, he didn't put forward an alternative or do 

a kind of methodological analysis of Ragusa, did 

he? 

MR. GORE: He did point out some of 

the flaws in -- in his expert reports, including 

this use of total numbers instead of 

percentages.  He also talked about the 

contiguity issue in the county envelope analysis 

I was just discussing with Justice Barrett. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But you --

MR. GORE: He did --

did?

 these methodological flaws.  And we pointed them 

out also to the district court.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And what if the

 district court disagreed?  I mean, the district 

court ultimately relies on Ragusa's expert --

expertise, and you say that you challenged, 

although you did not really bring an expert

 report that met Ragusa at the same level, but

 you -- you raised the objections, and the 

district court disagreed apparently, right? 

MR. GORE: That's correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  So I guess 

what I'm concerned about is that I kind of hear 

you wanting us to do a de novo review, as 

opposed to a clear error review, because, to the 

extent that you're now asking us to look at the 

flaws in Ragusa's testimony and I guess disagree 

with the district court's crediting that -- that 

-- that report, that sounds to me like de novo. 

I understood from Cooper that the 

clear error standard -- and I had it here a 

second ago -- is a highly deferential standard, 

that the Court may not reverse just because it 

would have decided the matter differently.  A 

finding that is plausible in light of the full

record, even if another is equally or more so,

 must govern.

 So to what extent do we have to credit

 the district court's disagreement with your

 objections to Ragusa's report?

 MR. GORE: That's a great question. 

Let me give a couple of responses.

 First of all, as you just read from 

Cooper, the court has to consider whether it's 

plausible in light of the entire record and all 

of the evidence.  And, here, the district court 

just ignored other evidence that was put 

forward. 

What we are asking the Court to do is 

exactly what it did in Cromartie II.  In 

Cromartie II, there was a plaintiff's expert who 

did an analysis of VTDs moved in or moved out or 

potentially available to the district.  The 

state also put forward an expert to give the 

contradictory interpretation of that evidence, 

but the district court excluded that expert. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes --

MR. GORE: Once the case --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- but wasn't there 

other -- I'm sorry. Wasn't Cromartie II a

 MR. GORE: Sure, which, again, is all 

the more reason why the racial target theory in 

this case just makes no sense, because there's

 no motive -- clear motivation to --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand. 

You're sort of shifting. I guess I'm just

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Cromartie II --

MR. GORE: So Cromartie II --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- you're asking us 

to do the same thing? 

MR. GORE: -- we had exactly the same 

situation with the experts.  The district court 

had excluded the defense expert, so that expert 

wasn't really considered by this Court on 

review, but this Court went through as part of 

clear error to ensure that the district court 

had not relied on -- relied on clearly erroneous 

expert testimony and a bad methodology.  That's 

what most of Cromartie II found. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But how does clear 

error work in that?  Like, I understood the 

standard now, post-Cooper, to be is it plausible

Ragusa's testimony and could have found it to be

 reliable.  And in the absence of a defense

 expert that's actually poking methodological 

holes in it, I think you have a hard time, you 

know, if our burden is just to say was it

 plausible that the -- the district court got it

 right in terms of the -- of the crediting of the

MR. GORE: I don't think that's what

requires.

me what it requires.

court's finding of predominance as -- as a 

finding plausible in light of the whole record? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And that --

MR. GORE: It doesn't mean --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- includes both the 

expertise and also the district court's 

credibility findings?  Which is another sort of 

aspect of this that I really wanted to pin down.

other evidence.  But it did have a trial, and it

brief, requires a determination about the 

demeanor of the witness on the stand. 

Otherwise, district courts could always wrap

 their fact findings in credibility

 determinations in an -- in an attempt to avoid

 review.  They didn't even do that here. There

 isn't that kind of classic credibility

 determination.

MS. ADEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

No party disputes Cooper's basic legal 

rule that absent a compelling interest, race 

cannot predominate in line drawing, even as a 

means to achieve a partisan goal.  Here, the 

panel properly concluded that race predominated 

over partisanship in CD1's design based on 

strong factual findings, including that after

 In so doing, mapmakers sorted more 

than 30,000 black Charlestonians based on their 

race, removing 11 of the 12 precincts with the

 highest black Voting-Age Populations.  This

 massive movement disregarded the least change 

approach that the state applied statewide and

 that map-makers admitted they abandoned only in 

Charleston County, which had been CD1's 

historical anchor. 

Disentangling race and party 

affiliation using the very methods this Court 

accepted in Cooper, the panel credited the 

unrebutted expert testimony that race was a 

better predictor than partisan affiliation for 

the design of CD1. 

Under the clear error review standard, 

this Court should affirm the panel's factual --

racial gerrymandering factual finding because it 

is more than plausible in light of the total of 

the record.  Appellants also cannot show that 

the panel committed a legal error, particularly 

in its rejection of the alternative map 

requirement.

this Court determined that mapmakers designed a 

district using political voting behavior over

 time, rather than relying upon racial

 stereotypes.

 Here, by contrast, the panel found

 non-credible the Appellants' assertion that they

 relied on merely 2020 partisan performance data

 for CD1's design. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, we normally 

have an alternate map in these redistricting 

cases, and, of course, we don't have one here. 

In these -- in instances where you have a high 

correlation between race and political 

affiliation, how would you constitutionally 

disentangle them? 

MS. ADEN: We have something we 

believe that was better, if not comparable, to 

an alternative map.  We have this unrebutted 

testimony of Dr. Ragusa.  That testimony is 

corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Liu. 

If you look at the amici briefs of the 

political scientists who performed the analysis 

in Cooper, they validate that the methods that

Dr. Ragusa and Dr. Liu used are the same as in

 Cooper.  All of the potshots that are made by 

the defendants in their brief about Dr. Ragusa's 

analyses and Dr. Liu's, almost all of them,

 nearly all of them, and I can walk you through

 them, were made during either discovery or 

during Daubert motions or at trial, and the

 court simply didn't reject them.

 It is unrebutted evidence 

disentangling race and party, which is a form of 

circumstantial evidence, but akin to an 

alternative map.  If you look at Dr. Ragusa's 

rebuttal report, Figure 1, he charts out all the 

VTDs in CD1, and he looks at the -- whether the 

racial part -- composition or the political 

composition determined their placement in the 

map. And you can see that four of the five 

heaviest black precincts were moved out of CD1. 

By contrast, only five of the 17 majority white 

precincts were removed from CD1. 

And this is, again, unrebutted 

testimony, and it serves the purpose of an 

alternative map because this Court unanimously 

in Desert Palace said that there is no 

particular form of proof a plaintiff needs to

no odd-shaped districts, which we often get in

political data that you're suggesting your

of racial data. 

Have we ever had a case like that with 

that combination?  We usually are looking for 

those sorts of things and we have those.  Have 

we ever had a case before where all it is is 

circumstantial evidence?

circumstantial evidence was overwhelming.

 But, here, if you're asking whether

 there is direct evidence that the legislature 

admitted in the 21st Century that they sorted

 voters on the basis of race as a means to 

achieve their political goal, no, we do not have

 that.

 But what we do have is the factual 

finding that the map-makers had Maptitude data 

with race data --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I 

understand that, and there's a lot of 

back-and-forth on it, and you certainly have the 

clear error standard in reviewing that. 

But we've never had a case where 

there's been no direct evidence, no map, no 

strangely configured districts, a very large 

amount of political evidence, whether the 

district court chose to credit it or not, and, 

instead, it all resting on circumstantial 

evidence. 

Circumstantial evidence to -- to 

determine what we held as recently as in Allen 

last year is something that is peculiarly in the 

province of the states in drawing the districts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry to

 interrupt.  And that is to change the voting 

percentage in that district by how much?

 MS. ADEN: Ultimately, it was by

 1.36 percent, and Senator Campsen used that 

1.36 percent, the lead sponsor, to disclaim that 

this was a partisan gerrymander during the

 legislative process. 

So the court accepted that they had a 

legitimate means to achieve this political goal. 

We don't dispute that. The court accepted that 

they had this preference to bring in political 

counties.  But what the court acknowledged is 

that when bring -- they brought in those 

counties, there were black people brought in 

alongside with them. 

That then led to an increased BVAP in 

CD1 that became too politically risky.  And for 

the black people they brought in, they offset 

the black people by --

 MS. ADEN: Because, once again, we

 think that we proffered evidence that was as 

good as, if not comparable to, an alternative

 map. You can --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But they -- you admit

 they could have done that? It wouldn't have

 been a big burden for them to do that? 

MS. ADEN: Well, I would submit --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And they didn't do it? 

MS. ADEN: -- that the legislative 

record reflects that the partisan justifications 

did not become clear until midway through trial. 

For most of the legislative session, most of 

discovery in the case, the map -- enacted map 

was defended as being compliant with traditional 

redistricting principles. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, this whole 

case --

MS. ADEN: It only --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- this whole case is 

about -- is about disentangling race and 

politics, right?  That's what the whole case is 

about.

 the map was largely based upon traditional

 redistricting principles until trial.  Then, at 

trial, the lead counsel says this was about

 partisanship, this was about -- and the map --

 this a Republican-leaning district.

 notwithstanding looking at BVAP throughout the

 legislative process, they were running BVAP 

reports for every map and they were looking at

 the connection between racial data and political

 data, and because they believed, whether they

relied upon one piece of partisan data or not, 

they were relying upon race consistently to 

understand the ramifications politically for 

their map drawing.

racial data and BVAP data than they are partisan 

data? They used the 2020 political data that

And what the record reflects is that

 they were consistently looking at race because 

they had an expectation that race was a

 predictor for how political outcomes would

 perform.  This is shown in the closing argument 

of counsel, my friend, who showed the connection

 between race and party in his closing.  But he 

was relying upon racial reports and some

 partisan reports that were being generated 

during the legislative process. 

And, once again, it is more than 

plausible that the court said in the total of 

evidence that the fact that there was this 

consistency in the BVAP, despite the fact that 

maps were changing over time, the House even 

tried to propose a map that was 20 percent BVAP, 

and Senator Campsen intervened, and then the 

House ultimately adopted a map with the BVAP. 

The National Republican Redistricting Trust was 

proposing maps around 17 percent. 

And in the colloquy with Mr. Roberts, 

the court asked:  What would happen if you bring 

in VTDs or counties that maybe are not majority 

black but are below majority black?  Would that 

affect the overall BVAP of your district?  And

he acknowledged that it would.  So --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, when race and --

when race and partisanship are so closely 

aligned, as they are in fact, why is it

 surprising that a legislature that is pursuing a

 partisan goal would favor a -- a map that turns 

out consistently to have the same BVAP?

 MS. ADEN: Because, if they're using 

race as the means to get there, this Court last 

term said that a legitimate interest cannot be 

achieved --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah. 

MS. ADEN: -- with illegitimate ends. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, if they're -- if 

that's what they're using.  But, if they are 

disregarding race entirely and looking only at 

politics, where race and politics are so closely 

aligned, it isn't surprising that when you want 

to get a district that has a certain Republican 

percentage, you're going to get a district that 

has a -- a -- a steady BVAP. 

MS. ADEN: Two responses to that. 

Even if the map-maker wasn't just looking at

17 percent prior to 2018. It worked at

 17 percent after 2018. They were defending this 

map as being least change, a map that had

 pre-cleared the Department of Justice, that had

 survived a constitutional challenge.  And, 

again, the lead sponsor said we only wanted to 

make this a little bit more Republican-leaning 

at trial. 

So they served their purpose, but at 

the heart of this, they served their purpose by

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's predominantly

 white, isn't it?

 MS. ADEN: It's predominantly white, 

but the precincts with the highest and most 

significant black populations, those were 

targeted for movement. And the court recognized 

that, yes, white voters may be overall impacted 

by this map, but because this is a White versus 

Regester reality on the ground look by this 

three-judge panel, they recognized that there 

were some mixed precincts.  There were white 

voters impacted. 

But the unrebutted expert evidence is 

that race was a better predictor for movement 

and that black Democrat -- black voters were 

significantly and disproportionately targeted 

for movement. 

And that is unrebutted by the state. 

The district court says they cannot explain the 

30,000 Charlestonians moved out of CD1. They've 

never been able to explain that --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, I think this 

goes to what Mr. Gore claims is a very serious 

flaw in Dr. Ragusa's methodology, and I -- I 

want you to talk about that. Maybe you have a 

good answer to his argument.

 So let's say the Republican

 legislature is intent on ensuring that District 

1 has a Republican lead. Then, all else being 

equal, which of the following two precincts 

would they rather include in District 1:  a 

district with -- a precinct with 3,000 residents 

that went 900 to 800 for Trump, 900 votes for 

President Trump, 800 votes for President Biden, 

or a precinct with the same number of residents, 

3,000, that went 700 to 600 for Biden, 700, 

okay, 700 votes for President Biden, 600 for 

Trump? Which one would you rather include if 

you're a Republican legislature that wants to 

produce a Republican-leaning district? 

MS. ADEN: I would like to know two 

things with respect to the racial makeup of 

those precincts because, here, we know that the

So you'd rather keep the -- the

 district that went 900 to 800 for Trump because

 there are 800 Biden votes there, as opposed to 

the one that went 600 -- 700 to 600 for Biden

 because there are fewer Biden votes there.

 MS. ADEN: But Dr. Ragusa --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry -- yeah?

 MS. ADEN: -- in his rebuttal report, 

I think pages 3 through 4, controls for the 

precinct size and, notwithstanding controlling 

for that, in his analysis determines that black 

voters were moved out, white voters were kept in 

or moved in.  And that is unrebutted data.  So 

he controlled for this. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what I just said 

is his methodology, is it not? He looked at the 

absolute number of votes for President Biden, 

not the percentage, not the net votes. 

MS. ADEN: And Dr. Ragusa testified 

about why looking at the total net was the 

better methodology than the percentages, and 

this was tested below, and the district court 

did not accept these arguments. 

And so this goes to, are we retrying 

expert testimony on appeal?  Or do three judges,

 The second one is:  "Roberts failed to 

provide the court with any plausible explanation 

for the abandonment of his 'least change' 

approach in drawing the Charleston County 

portions of Congressional District Numbers 1 and 

6 or the subordination of traditional 

districting principles, including maintenance of 

constituencies, minimizing divisions of 

counties, and avoidance of racial 

gerrymandering." 

So they say he gave no plausible 

explanation for that?

Mr. Roberts admitted he abandoned the core 

priority of least change in CD1.

expert testimony that, again, they had the

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So,

 in this -- and the last one is he admitted that

 his movement of nearly 17,000 African Americans 

was inconsistent with the Clyburn staff plan for 

Charleston County that he claimed to be

 faithfully following, right?

 Did he ever say, we followed exactly 

what -- what Congressman Clyburn asked us to do? 

Did he ever say that? 

MS. ADEN: The state makes a big 

defense that their map is consistent with what 

Senator Clyburn or Representative Clyburn was 

seeking.  The amicus brief shows that that is 

not what the record actually reflects. 

And, more importantly, what the Court 

found was that Representative Clyburn's partial 

map did not treat the area of West Ashley, which 

was so critical to the VTDs that were moved out 

that sorted voters on the basis of race -- the 

partial map that Representative Clyburn put 

forward did not harm West Ashley in the same 

way.

the question I asked about why your experts did 

not produce an alternative map.

 Dr. Imai produced 10,000 maps, right?

 MS. ADEN: Correct, for one

 simulation.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, he ran a

 simulation with 10,000 maps.  He never

 considered politics?

 MS. ADEN: As Dr. Imai's testimony 

reflects, that he tested for the criteria that 

the state was saying they were using in their 

guidelines, the objective criteria, and Dr. Imai 

and Dr. Duchin's methods are merely useful in 

this case as further support, as the district 

court recognized, to show that race was a 

significant factor in the design. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in a -- in a 

case that's all about disentangling race and 

politics, how can we possibly give any weight to 

an expert report that did not take politics into 

account at all purportedly? 

MS. ADEN: The district court was 

confronted with that question and relied upon 

Dr. Imai's testimony for the findings that it 

thought were probative or not of the issue, but

we do have the Dr. Ragusa and the Dr. Liu

 unrebutted testimony that did disentangle race.

 And that served the purpose of an 

alternative map because we can look at Figure 1 

in the rebuttal report that Dr. Ragusa includes 

and look at the VTDs that were available to be

 moved in in a white -- heavily white precincts

 that were available to be moved in and those

 simply were not moved in. 

So they served the same purpose as an 

alternative --

JUSTICE ALITO:  The defense expert, 

Mr. -- Sean Trende or Trende, evaluated 

Dr. Ragusa's maps and found that Democrats would 

win District 1 in over 90 percent of the maps 

that Dr. Ragusa produced. 

Did Dr. Imai run a simulation using 

the political data as well but then decide to 

shelve it when the results were not favorable to 

your client? 

MS. ADEN: That is not what I believe 

the record reflects, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It just never occurred 

to him that politics might have something to do 

with this?

Justice Kagan said, is being tasked with

 particular questions.  Not every -- I do not 

believe that there's any requirement that every 

expert look at every decision that one might go

 into a map.

 Each expert looks at different things. 

Dr. Ragusa and Dr. Imai -- I mean Dr. Ragusa and 

Dr. Liu served the purpose of disentangling and 

showing that race was more predictive than party 

affiliation. 

Dr. Imai and Dr. Duchin helped counter 

this narrative that this was a race-blind draw 

when all of the evidence demonstrates otherwise. 

And, frankly, Dr. Duchin's testimony looked at 

all of the traditional redistricting principles. 

And I would submit that these were all 

raised pre-trial, and this is the type of --

this is what trial courts are given the 

authority to do, not to have what is happening 

here, but as relitigating the validity of expert 

testimony that the court accepted. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Dr. Imai 

did not control for politics.  Did the district 

court rely on Dr. Liu?

MS. ADEN: The court did not 

specifically rely upon Dr. Liu, but his

 analyses, as the amici of the political 

scientists who did the work in Cooper, 

corroborate that he used the same methods that

 were faithful to Cooper, and his analyses

 substantiate Dr. Ragusa's and point in the same

 direction --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Did Doctor --

MS. ADEN: -- that race was a better 

predictor than partisanship. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry.  Did 

Dr. Duchin control for politics? 

MS. ADEN: She did in some of her 

analyses.  If you look at one of her 

supplemental reports, she looked at how the --

the maps were fair when you put particularly the 

candidates of choice of black voters on the map, 

and she determined that black candidates 

performed worse in the enacted map than generic 

partisan races, which were essentially white-on-

white races.  So that is one way that she looked 

at partisanship. 

But she did not do a disentangling 

method if that is what you're getting at.

 I'm sorry to go on for so long.  Did Dr. Liu and 

Dr. Ragusa use the county envelope method?

 MS. ADEN: They both did, correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that -- is that a

 sound method?

 MS. ADEN: It is.  It's what 

Dr. Ansolabehere and Dr. Max Palmer used in

 Cooper and Bethune-Hill, respectively. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Under that method, if 

there are two people who live in the same 

apartment building, under the county envelope 

method, could one -- does the analysis take into 

-- presume that one can be moved and the other 

can't? 

MS. ADEN: I believe --

JUSTICE ALITO:  One could stay in --

in -- in a district and the other could move? 

MS. ADEN: I do not believe that's the 

case because he's looking -- the county envelope 

method is relying upon precincts, and so it 

would not be at that level of detail. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does it assume that a

that a county like Berkeley or a county like 

Beaufort was wholly moved into CD1, so it was 

fair for Dr. Ragusa and Dr. Imai to assume that 

any VTD in those counties could have been moved 

into CD1. And where we saw that they were not

been assumed that partisanship would be the

 defense -- do you know if the answer in this 

case raised partisanship as a defense?

 MS. ADEN: I do not believe so.

 Again, the legislature almost entirely

 predicated their line drawing during the 

legislative process on traditional redistricting 

principles. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you were 

relying on what they said during the process? 

MS. ADEN: What they said.  And this 

Court has been skeptical when legislatures have 

come up with post-hoc justifications.  But 

what's important here is that the legislature --

the court -- the panel accepted their 

justification, presumed that they would not 

admit it and then still allow plaintiffs to test 

whether that was the true reason behind the line 

drawing and found that it was not.  It was less 

of a predictor than race.

 of the record -- then doesn't that mean you

 couldn't draw the first district without some

 significant changes?

 MS. ADEN: Those are generally the 

findings of the court, but the court recognized 

and detailed in its opinion that when Beaufort, 

when Berkeley, when Dorchester were brought in,

 they had black neighbors, and those black 

neighbors increased the BVAP in CD1 to a 

politically risky 20 percent and black 

Charlestonians were offset. 

Black people were treated one-to-one, 

traded one in, one out.  White voters, the 

Republican-leaning ones, were individualized and 

allowed to come into CD1, and white Democrats 

were even kept in or individualized and allowed 

to remain in CD1. 

It's only black people in the design 

of this district that were treated with racial 

stereotyping, which is offensive to this -- the 

Constitution.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The other side

 makes a point that the original plan that came 

from Representative Clyburn's office actually 

had a lower black voting population for District 

1 than what ultimately emerged. I just want to 

get your response to that, the relevance of that 

in the overall record. 

MS. ADEN: I think it's irrelevant 

because I don't think that his map determined 

the -- the sorting that was actually done by the 

key decisionmakers that the court acknowledged. 

But even more, if you look to the 

amici brief that Representative Clyburn's office 

offers in this case, they provided a partial 

map, and then, from there, the state drew out 

the -- a partial map of one district and, from 

there, drew out the other six districts.

evaluate whether we agreed or disagreed with 

each of their findings, whether we would have 

found -- you know, had a different takeaway from 

the fact that, you know, his testimony, the

that be a basis for clear error? Do I not

MS. ADEN: I don't believe that you

 do. I believe that the credibility 

determinations, the ability for the court, as in

 White v. Regester, as in Cooper, to have 

listened to the witnesses, is clearly given much

 deference by this Court, that the racial

 gerrymandering finding is -- is a clear error

 finding and the subsidiary findings --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, but -- and 

the subsidiary findings --

MS. ADEN: -- are also --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- as well so that 

if the district court said we don't believe he 

gave a plausible explanation and we look at it 

and we think the explanation is plausible, that 

distinction, the fact that we disagree with that 

particular subsidiary finding, is not the basis 

for clear error, is that right?

It's the total record.

maybe you would have clear error if, for 

example, the district court didn't have any

nothing maybe. But, in this case, they did have

 three reasons, right, why they didn't agree with 

him? So I guess I just want to be clear as to

 what we're looking at from -- from the

 standpoint of clear error.

 MS. ADEN: I think it's at least three 

reasons, and I think -- for why the court did 

not credit all of his reasons for why the map 

was drawn the way that they did. And it wasn't 

just that he -- the court just listened to his 

testimony and said I disagree with you but that 

that testimony did not align with the other 

facts in the record, which reflected that race 

predominance was occurring in this map, and that 

is overall a finding that's backed up not only 

by the unrebutted disentangling method but is 

borne out by the state's own data. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me 

ask about the hypothetical that Justice Alito 

put forward with respect to moving in 900 Trump 

voters versus -- you know, a district with 900 

Trump voters and 600 Biden voters versus a 

district with 700 Biden voters and 600 Trump 

voters.

think if -- I think his point was that if 

politics is at play, then, clearly, you'd want 

to bring in the district with more Trump voters 

if you are trying to get a Republican tilt.

 And I think that's -- I think that's 

right, but I guess what I am trying to

 understand is how the BVAP stays the same unless 

you're looking at race so that if you bring in 

the district with more Trump voters, the 

assumption, I think, that everybody seems to be 

operating under is that you would -- that 

district would likely have more white voters in 

it because race is correlating with -- with --

with politics. 

And if that's the case, then I would 

expect bringing that district in, the BVAP would 

drop. And yet, here, it stayed the same, and I 

understood your argument to be, because black 

voters elsewhere were moved out, that race was 

used to move out black voters in a -- when you 

brought in the 900 Trump voter district. 

Is that the point that you're making? 

MS. ADEN: That is the point that I'm 

making, that's correct.

that that is the unlawful application of racial

 gerrymandering.  So even though, as Justice 

Kavanaugh pointed out, the sort of overall BVAP 

remains the same, in a situation in which you're 

bringing in more white voters and moving out

 black voters, in -- in this kind of 

circumstance, you're still relying on race in a 

way that is, you say, improper?

 MS. ADEN: Yes. Correct.  And I would 

only detail that not only are you moving in 

white voters, you're moving in black voters, and 

you're not just -- and then, for those black 

voters moved in, you're offsetting them by 

kicking out the black Charlestonians.  And 

that's exactly what the court details in its 

opinion happened here, the race as the means to 

achieve this political goal. 

And I just want to acknowledge also 

that this is not -- I mentioned at the onset 

this is not the case of Cromartie, where this 

Court said the plaintiffs failed to prove racial 

predominance because we see in the record that 

they were actually looking at voting behavior 

data.

reflects they were looking at racial data to --

 its connection, but they were relying upon race

 data and they had no good reason to do that.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLINE A. FLYNN

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

 MS. FLYNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 it please the Court: 

This Court has recognized that cases 

like these, where state defendants disclaim the 

use of race in line drawing and argue that any 

racial disparities are simply the result of a 

correlation between race and political 

affiliation, present special challenges for 

trial courts and require an especially sensitive 

inquiry. 

As part of that inquiry, plaintiffs 

bear the burden to disentangle race and politics 

and show that race drove the map-makers' 

decisions about where to place a significant 

number of voters.  The district court found that 

plaintiffs had done that here. 

But this Court has also been clear 

that on appeal, this Court's job is more 

straightforward.  Racial predominance is a 

factual finding subject to clear error review 

even when there's a politics defense. 

The Court has also repeatedly rejected

 redistricting plaintiffs. 

Defendants' arguments for reversal in 

this case contradict those settled principles.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  If we find no intent

on the vote dilution claim, that's what I'm more

intent, should we, or should we just simply

second claim is that if this Court were not to 

affirm on the first racial gerrymandering 

claim --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MS. FLYNN: -- and not find racial 

predominance there, that this Court should 

remand on the second claim because we believe 

the district court used the wrong legal 

standards to evaluate that claim. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And what should that 

standard be?

MS. FLYNN: So, first, we -- the

 district court simply sort of took the findings

 it had made on racial predominance and the Shaw 

standard and carried them over, but the intent

 standard is different for an intentional vote

 dilution claim.  It's the Arlington Heights 

inquiry that this Court --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And that is -- it's

 the -- again, the vote dilution claim. It seems 

as though those were collapsed into one another, 

the redistribute -- the redistricting and the 

vote dilution, and dealt with on -- on the same 

standard. 

So I'm wondering, if the standard is 

intent with respect to the dilution claim, if 

you don't see that intent here, why should we 

remand it? 

MS. FLYNN: Well, I don't think the 

court -- the district court made the findings 

under the correct intent standard for you to 

evaluate that. I mean, as I mentioned, the 

district court just asked about racial 

predominance, but they are different intent 

inquiries.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Put -- yeah. 

Putting that aside, have you ever supported the

 plaintiffs in a case in which there was no

 evidence of any direct discrimination, no

 alternative map, no oddly shaped districts, and

 a -- volume and volume of political data?

 Can you think of one where your --

your office has done that before? 

MS. FLYNN: Well, I -- you know, this 

might be the first case where there hasn't been 

sort of direct evidence of an attempt at VRA 

compliance or the like, but I do think that --

when you brought up the alternative map, I do 

think that the -- or the plaintiffs offered 

expert evidence to answer that same question 

about was it race or was it politics that were 

driving the line-drawing decisions. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, that's 

one of the things I brought up. I also brought 

up the absence of direct discrimination, the 

absence of oddly shaped districts, the lack of 

-- I mean the great volume of political 

evidence, and throw in another one, anything 

that all of that has been done, it is alleged on

district of the desired voters by 1.3 percent?

 I mean -- I mean, my point is -- is a clear one.

 Have -- have you ever seen anything

 like this?

 MS. FLYNN: Well, this Court has

 affirmed, I believe, on a circumstantial record

 I think in North Carolina versus Covington.  The

 Court said that there, the state was completely 

denying using race.  The legislature told its 

map-maker not to look at race.  And this Court 

still said it was permissible for the district 

court to find based on demographic information 

and information about the shape of the district 

that race was, in fact, relied upon. 

I'd also say that here, the district 

court did look at traditional redistricting 

principles and find that they were subordinated 

in this instance.  For instance, this new 

district is not contiguous when the previous 

district was. 

Of course, there was previously a 

Charleston County divide, but this is I don't 

think the case that the traditional districting 

principles wholly supported the state's story

here.

 And I will sort of go back to the 

expert evidence in this case. In our view, we

 think the Ragusa expert and Liu were the most

 probative on the question we've been talking 

about today, which is was it race or was it 

politics that were driving the district lines.

 And Dr. Ragusa took the methodology in 

Cooper, arguably improved upon it by looking at 

VTDs at precincts rather than voter by voter, 

which is what the Cooper expert did, and then he 

also ran a regression analysis to further 

isolate out the effect of race from politics. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, I -- I -- I 

want to just explore the alternative map 

non-requirement requirement thing for a minute. 

MS. FLYNN: Sure. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Everybody seems to 

take as given that the legislature here did seek 

to pursue a partisan gerrymander, if you will, 

or a partisan tilt, I think, is their preferred 

term, and that that's permissible under this 

Court's precedents.  We start with that as a 

given.

 MS. FLYNN: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  How do you prove 

that they are acting in bad faith without 

showing that they could achieve their objective 

some different way? 

MS. FLYNN: I agree that that could be 

a probative piece of evidence in some cases, and 

I think that's what the Court said in Cooper. 

What we're pushing back on is the idea that you 

need to have, as a matter of law, for the 

plaintiffs' case to even get off the ground, an 

alternative map that checks all the boxes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No -- I -- I get 

that, and I'm wondering why.  I mean, normally, 

if a plaintiff bears a burden of proof, you have 

to show that it would have happened but for, you 

know, the -- this change in the world.

 Probably am.  But, in a but-for world, the 

legislature could have achieved its partisan 

purposes, nefarious, happy, whatever you think 

they are, in some other way without -- without

 doing what it did that you're objecting to.

 And, here, there's no -- no evidence 

that the legislature could have achieved its 

partisan tilt, which everyone says is 

permissible, in any other way. 

MS. FLYNN: So I --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What do we do with 

that when -- when -- with the presumption of 

good faith? 

MS. FLYNN: So I have a couple 

responses to that.  First, I do think the expert 

evidence answer the same question.  An 

alternative map says, if you were really relying 

on the thing you said you were relying, wouldn't 

you have done -- maybe you would have done this 

other thing instead. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I could have 

achieved the same partisan objective 15 

different ways, and with map-drawing technology

maps by the thousands these days. I would have 

thought that would have been a relatively modest

 burden.

 MS. FLYNN: But it's still --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What am I missing? 

MS. FLYNN: -- it's still just a way 

to answer the question what better explains how 

the lines were drawn. And we think the expert 

evidence does that. 

The other thing I would say about 

creating this kind of requirement as a legal 

rule, rather than something that can be a piece 

of evidence that both sides can make arguments 

about, is that I think it's going to add even 

more complication to these even very, very 

complicated cases. 

So my understanding is that defendants 

want their alternative map requirement to be 

limited to circumstances where there is no or 

meager direct evidence.  So I think, first, 

you're going to have a mini-trial on is this a 

case where there's sufficient direct evidence or 

not to bring this rule into play. 

And then I think you're going to have

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- should its 

absence here tell us something?

 MS. FLYNN: I don't think so, because 

I think the plaintiffs offered two experts that

 went unrebutted to answer the same question.

 I will also just point out that I 

believe there are maps that are in the record 

that did have a higher BVAP that stayed based on 

the 2020 election data as a Republican-leaning 

district.  So, you know, I don't -- I believe 

those maps are the first House staff plan and I 

think there was one from a Senator Sabb that 

also had that. 

So, you know, whether -- what's 

easier, easiest for a plaintiff to do to prove 

their case, I'm not really in a position to sort 

of speak to their litigation choices, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the point, 

isn't it? There were maps that remained 

Republican-leaning that were rejected, and, 

instead, there was this unusual movement in and 

out based on race.  That's what the experts 

showed, that you can't explain the movements

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I had this

do you think our law permits that?

matter how laudatory it is, if the only way that 

you can satisfy yourself for whatever your 

political reasons are is by using race, that's 

illegal. 

MS. FLYNN: Right.  This Court said 

that in Cooper, and the plurality opinion said 

that in Bush v. Vera as well. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

MS. FLYNN: You can't use race as a 

proxy for a political goal.

right, you could understand completely why it 

was that map-makers started doing race in order 

to achieve partisan gerrymanders, because they 

couldn't do partisan gerrymanders directly. 

They were afraid that that was going to be found 

unlawful. 

But now that Rucho has come about and

have been held to be non-justiciable, you know,

some people might sort of say, well, I don't get 

it. Like, why do people keep using race when

 they can just do it directly?  Just do -- use

 the election data, do the partisan

 gerrymandering.

 You know, doesn't the fact that they 

can do it directly suggest that they're not --

why would you need race as a proxy? So that's 

my question to you. 

Why would map-makers in general and in 

this case use race as a proxy to do partisan 

gerrymandering now that you could just, like, do 

partisan gerrymandering? 

MS. FLYNN: So I don't know that I'm 

in a position to speak to in general, but in 

this case, as has been discussed earlier today, 

there was evidence in the record that the 

political data the map-makers had available was 

sort of limited and imperfect.  It was a single 

election that wasn't congressional, and it was 

not looking at the durability of voting across 

multiple elections. 

So, there -- given the evidence that 

voting is racially polarized in South Carolina, 

it was plausible for the district court to find

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Your brief also

 makes the point that it would have been

 plausible for the district court to have come to

 the exact opposite conclusion it came to here 

and that it would have been just as plausible 

for them to find, as Justice Kagan alluded to, 

that the simplest explanation was they wanted to 

do politics and they did politics. 

How does that -- how should we think 

about that under our clear error standard? 

MS. FLYNN: So we've made that point 

in previous cases before this Court as well.  We 

think that the clear error standard doesn't ask 

what is the most plausible reading of the record 

or whether, on the whole, more evidence supports 

one outcome than the other.  It asks just 

whether the district court's is plausible based 

on the entirety of the evidence, and so --

that fit with the presumption of good faith that

 actions here, that we ask people, lower courts, 

to make sure that they're -- they're not

 overstepping their bounds and -- and getting too 

involved in state and local politics?

 MS. FLYNN: We think the -- the 

presumption of good faith is sort of baked into

 how the burdens work here and also that in this 

particular case, the plaintiffs did have the 

obligation to disentangle race and politics. 

And we also think that the predominant standard 

is a very high standard that also accounts --

that doesn't, you know, find predominance met 

based just on racial awareness or race 

consciousness.  And so we think setting the bar 

that high is what affords respect to 

legislatures' districting choices in this area.

MS. FLYNN: I think the expert 

evidence played a very big role here. You know, 

I think the district court is in a very good 

position to make the kind of assessments about 

methodology that we've been discussing here

 today.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But you've looked 

at this record and you obviously concluded that 

the district court could have said no, that 

expert evidence is not sufficiently reliable or 

probative in light of the overall record to 

support the plaintiffs' case? 

MS. FLYNN: Well, we think that the 

expert evidence is a big part of it.  We think 

that there were credibility findings here that 

might have come out differently with a different 

three-judge panel possibly. It's kind of hard 

to tell because we weren't there seeing the 

witnesses firsthand. 

And, you know, we -- we take the point 

that these are just difficult cases, as this 

Court said in Cooper, when there is a political 

defense being raised and so you can often 

describe or attribute certain oddities in 

district lines to being politics or race.

And so, given that, we recognize that

 district courts have a -- a tough job here to 

sort of just look at the entirety of the 

evidence and figure out whether or not the 

plaintiffs can carry their burden.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  To -- to pick up 

on Justice Kagan's question and I think a big

 theme of the other side's briefing is, why would 

we do this when we have the political data? 

Justice Kagan mentioned that.  And that's all 

over the briefs and the amicus briefs on their 

side. 

And then I think the main response is 

the political data is not good enough to achieve 

the end they want to achieve of a greater 

Republican tilt. 

Do you agree with that? 

MS. FLYNN: Yes.  We agree there's 

evidence in the record for the district court to 

-- to find that, yes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  What if we 

disagree on that point about the strength of the 

political data?  I think an earlier question

that data is.

 Suppose we think that data is fairly

 probative.  Does the whole case that -- that 

plaintiffs had, the district court's conclusion 

then all fall because that's really the linchpin 

of the response to the main argument that the 

state's giving, which is we relied on this

 political data, the response is that political 

data is no good, so you couldn't have been. 

If that data is good, should we 

reverse? 

MS. FLYNN: No, I don't think so. I 

think there is also the fact that the BVAP in 

CD1 stayed basically frozen even after about 

190,000 people were being moved in and out of 

the district.  I think there's the --

arrived at that exact same BVAP given those line 

drawings.

how people were moved in that area to achieve 

what the district court found was a racial

 target.  So there's that.

 There's the -- the disparities in

 white voters -- or black voters being taken out

 and white voters being left in, even of the same

 political party.  The district court did have 

credibility findings here. And there was also 

the expert evidence that isolated out race from 

political affiliation and said race explains the 

lines here. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why do you think 

2020 presidential election data is not reliable, 

probative, or whatever term you want to use 

there, or sufficiently reliable or probative 

that it would have made sense to rely on that? 

MS. FLYNN: I think looking at just 

one, and there's evidence in the record about 

all of this, but looking to just one election 

and not an election for the race that you're 

actually studying, my understanding is that when 

we do functional analyses of voting patterns, we 

look at multiple elections and, you know, hope 

to be able to look at voting patterns in races 

that are actually at issue with the districts

 I think there's also --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Would you think 

looking at 2020 and figuring out were you a 

Trump voter or were you a Biden voter is not 

probative to whether you're going to vote for

 Nancy Mace or not in the next election? 

MS. FLYNN: I think there is evidence 

discussing about how voters are more likely to 

-- at least I believe that white voters are more 

likely to switch over and vote for a candidate 

in a presidential race and not, you know, switch 

across party lines to do that. 

And given that evidence, I think it 

was plausible for the district court to reason 

that there would be a reason to rely on race in 

order to achieve the political goal.

and I'm not -- I'm talking about factual, I'm 

not talking about the arguments that there was 

legal error here, but we're reviewing it in 

light of the fact that the plaintiffs bear an

 exceedingly heavy burden when they're trying to 

disentangle race and politics and that we give

 the legislature a presumption of good faith.

 So we're asking whether the district 

court made a clear error in light of the fact 

that it was judging the factual record with 

those things into account. 

And the Chief Justice has outlined, 

you know, kind of the sum I think in a -- in a 

pretty concise way of the evidence which was all 

circumstantial here. 

I think there's a reason why 

Dr. Ragusa's report keeps coming up, is because 

it was the best of the expert reports that 

actually did try to disentangle race and 

politics, which was the key question here. 

And you pointed out, and -- and so 

did -- so did the Respondent, that they didn't 

point out an alternative map, but they had 

expert evidence that was just as good because it 

made similar points. But this is my question

 about Dr. Ragusa's evidence.

 Did it control for factors like

 contiguousness and compactness?  Because 

Respondent pointed out in trying to address this 

problem, which I think is one, you know, that

 we've all been asking about and struggling with,

 that, you know, Respondents said, well, some of

 the experts testified about traditional 

districting criteria and some testified about 

attempts to disentangle race and politics, and 

they were all showing different things, but did 

anybody consider all of them? 

Because it seems to me like that would 

be really relevant evidence.  And I want to be 

sure that I'm understanding Dr. Ragusa's 

testimony and its assumptions accurately. 

So what's -- what's your view on that? 

MS. FLYNN: So the county envelope 

methodology essentially looks at the area from 

which voters or, in this case, precincts, can be 

drawn by looking at the counties that previously 

constituted or overlapped with CD1, and he -- so 

that, I think, has these considerations built 

into the analysis because he's looking at, as 

the expert did in Cooper, which this Court

 available area from which the -- the map-makers

 had to draw.

 And I would also say that, you know,

 my friend has made the point that, you know,

 it's -- your -- theoretically possible that you

 can go pretty deep into a county under that

 analysis, but that is what the map-makers did.

 They took in the entirety of two 

counties and went to their furthest reaches when 

they drew the map, and so I think it was 

reasonable for Dr. Ragusa's analysis to do the 

same thing in figuring out the area from which 

he could draw. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And last question: 

How do you think we should think about clear 

error review in the kind of situation that I 

outlined where the plaintiffs' burden was so 

heavy below because of the good-faith standard 

and because of the heavy burden that a plaintiff 

bears in trying to disentangle race and 

politics? 

How do you think that should affect 

our review of the facts?

 error works.  It doesn't affect -- it doesn't

to ask about the question that Justice Kavanaugh 

asked with respect to our own assessment of the

Is that a finding of fact or that we 

would owe sort of clear error review deference 

to the district court's determination, or is 

that something we are apt to or allowed to take 

into account ourselves? 

MS. FLYNN: I think that's evidence 

that's in the record that renders the district

legislature's use of race plausible.  So, no, I

result from the fact that we might disagree

 about the fact that the district -- about the 

reliability of the presidential election?

 Do we owe the district court deference

 with respect to their determination that having 

that data, you know, was -- was not enough and

 that race was actually at issue here?  Do we owe 

them any deference with respect to that? 

MS. FLYNN: So I do want to be 

careful.  I'm not sure there was a specific 

finding in the district court opinion about this 

question of the 2020 data. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I see. 

MS. FLYNN: And so I think this is --

because this Court's looking at the -- all the 

evidence in the record to determine whether the 

findings the district court made were plausible, 

that's why I think this is coming up. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  And -- and 

with respect to this question about maps and 

alternative map, I'm just wondering whether or 

not an alternative map is helpful with respect

 This is similar to the question that I

 asked plaintiffs' counsel.  My understanding is 

that politics is driving it at a sort of meta 

level, and the map-maker identifies a

 Republican-leaning district that he would like

 to include.  That Republican-leaning district 

has both white and black voters in it. And so

 one would assume that just by that move, the 

BVAP goes up.  I don't know if that's right, but 

I'm just -- I'm walk -- I'm walking it through. 

But, in this situation, the BVAP stays 

the same at the end of the day and we have 

evidence that the map-maker went into the rest 

of the district and moved out a certain number 

of Democratic-leaning voters who happened to be 

black or plaintiffs say because they were black, 

but that's what makes the BVAP remain the same. 

It's that we've now moved out black Democrats to 

account for, I guess, the Republican-leaning 

district that we have included. 

Is the use of race in that way, you 

know, I have now got a higher BVAP than I want, 

and I'm moving out black voters, not white 

Democrats, black Democrats, in order to bring

 world?

 MS. FLYNN: Yes.  And we think that

 was a very probative piece of evidence that

 contributed to the district court's finding.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And what would a map 

do? If that's the kind of violation that I am 

trying to establish as the plaintiff, I guess 

what I don't understand is why having an 

alternative map is going to illuminate that in 

any way. 

MS. FLYNN: Right.  I think an 

alternative map could show a different way the 

lines could have been drawn and show whether or 

not there are different ways to do it that it 

could accomplish some or all of the defendants' 

goals, but I don't think it's the only way to 

answer this core question of what was driving 

the decisionmaking.  And --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And, in fact, if 

this dynamic is what is really bothering me, for 

example, as the plaintiff -- I'm putting myself 

in their shoes -- it doesn't necessarily even 

make sense to me that you would produce a map to 

prove that dynamic is happening. You would have

would, you know, explain it all through, but I

 don't -- I guess I just don't see how a map

 would be helpful if -- if that's the dynamic 

that I'm trying to focus on.

 MS. FLYNN: I think that it was very 

reasonable for plaintiffs to offer expert

 testimony to that.  I think the other evidence

 speaks to it as well.  I do think that cases 

have sort of a different mix of circumstantial, 

sometimes with direct, and you just kind of have 

to take the record and see what -- persuasive 

conclusions can be drawn for it without any --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So the government's 

position is that you don't necessarily have to 

have a map and you don't necessarily have to 

have direct evidence.  We've been hearing a lot 

about the lack of direct evidence in this case. 

Is there a world in which you can put 

together a case that demonstrates that race is 

actually operative in this environment without 

direct evidence and without a map?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 Rebuttal, Mr. Gore?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. GORE

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

 MR. GORE: Today's argument 

underscores why the alternative map requirement

 is so vital.  It ensures that racial 

gerrymandering cases remain focused on racial 

discrimination and not partisan disputes.  It 

also ensures that the grave finding of racial 

gerrymandering rests on actual evidence of 

racial predominance and not malleable expert 

analysis. 

If Dr. Ragusa were correct that race 

better explains the enacted plan than politics, 

it should have been very easy to draw an 

alternative map that disentangled the two and 

preserved the Republican political lean in 

District 1.  Appellees failed that requirement. 

They did put alternative maps into the record, 

so they obviously had the capacity to do that, 

and all the alternative maps turned District 1 

into a majority Democratic district.

United States about two plans in the record, the

 House Staff Plan and the Sabb Plan.  Neither of

 those increased the Republican tilt like the 

enacted plan did, and neither was as compliant 

with traditional districting principles, so 

neither of those plans would have been enacted. 

In fact, Senator Campsen became involved in 

drawing the enacted plan and sponsoring it

 precisely because the House Staff Plan imperiled 

District 1 and threatened to turn it into a 

majority Democratic district. 

Counsel for the other side mentioned 

Gomillion.  But, in Gomillion, there was an 

alternative map because there had been prior 

municipal boundaries of Tuskegee that were 

perfectly square before the redrawing that was 

done in an intentionally discriminatory way.  So 

that map also underscored that there was 

intentional discrimination in Gomillion, which 

is a totally different case from this for -- for 

a host of reasons otherwise. 

Let me address the point about 

election data.  The district court did not find 

that the 2020 presidential election data was 

unreliable.  The district court actually itself

relied on that data.  It used that data to 

illustrate the correlation between race and

 politics.  It thought that data was reliable. 

And all the direct evidence showed that it was 

reliable and far more reliable than racial data 

that doesn't address white voters and doesn't 

address voting and turnout.

 The reason that the General Assembly

 used only one year of election data is a very 

simple one in the record:  that 2020 was the 

first year that the Election Commission 

allocated absentee votes down to the precinct 

where the voter lives instead of at the county 

level. So it was more accurate and finely tuned 

data, political data, than any election data 

that had come before in the history of South 

Carolina. 

This is a circumstantial case with 

very weak circumstantial evidence.  There's no 

direct evidence.  There's no alternative map. 

Here, we have a plan that complied with 

traditional districting principles in Charleston 

County and in District 1 and did so better than 

all of the alternatives that were presented at 

trial.

There was a mention of contiguity.

 The district court also made no finding about

 contiguity.  The enacted District 1 is

 contiguous.  It's contiguous by water.  Every 

plan drawn in Charleston County is contiguous by

 water because Charleston County contains islands

 and rivers.  So there's nothing suspect about 

the contiguity of this particular plan.

 We heard about the Covington case. 

That was a remedial case. That was a remedial 

case where the panel had already found racial 

gerrymandering, sent it back to the legislature, 

and then determined that the legislature had not 

adequately fixed the problem.  It's not a case 

in which there was only weak circumstantial 

evidence to support a finding of racial 

gerrymandering. 

We heard today that the legislative 

record gave no indication that the General 

Assembly was drawing lines based on politics. 

That's completely incorrect.  The guidelines 

from both the House and the Senate permitted the 

General Assembly to draw based on politics, to 

draw communities of interest based on politics. 

And the House guidelines went even further.

They allowed the General Assembly to draw around 

communities of interest defined by voting

 behavior, which is exactly what the General

 Assembly did here.

 Senator Margie Bright Matthews, who 

was a Democrat who opposed the enacted plan, 

said on the floor of the Senate that it was

 about politics.  She even disclaimed the

 allegation that it was about race.  She said 

that Senator Campsen had drawn based on how 

people voted, including in West Ashley. 

This also -- this political goal also 

was made clear in discovery.  Mr. Roberts 

testified to it in his deposition.  Senator 

Campsen, Senator Massey, and also Representative 

Jordan.  There were production of emails and 

documents and text messages, including from 

Representative Jordan, establishing that the 

General Assembly had pursued a political goal. 

We've heard a lot of discussion today 

that Mr. Roberts or others were aware of race. 

But mere awareness of race does not prove racial 

predominance.  The question here is whether race
