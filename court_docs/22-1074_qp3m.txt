 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-1074, 

Sheetz versus the County of El Dorado.

 Mr. Beard.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BEARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The county refused to give George 

Sheetz a permit to build a home unless he paid a 

substantial fee to finance public road 

improvements.  He was faced with an impossible 

choice:  the taking of over $23,000 or the 

ability to use his land.  Though the fee went 

beyond mitigation, he did submit to the fee and 

paid under protest.  After all, the permit was 

worth far more than the fee. 

That's the same improper leveraging 

that led to this Court's rule in Nollan, Dolan, 

and Koontz that all permit exactions should be 

subject to heightened scrutiny.  Such review is 

needed to ensure that the government is not 

committing a taking in the guise of the police

power to mitigate for land use impacts.  Yet,

 the lower court refused to apply Nollan/Dolan 

simply because the fee came from a legislative,

 preset, generally applicable schedule that the

 county had adopted.

 The decision below is as wrong as it

 is dangerous.  First, nothing in the Court's

 exactions precedents, the Takings Clause, or the 

unconstitutional conditions doctrine justifies 

that broad exception. 

Second, it's a perversion of Nollan 

and Dolan to say that because an exaction is 

generally applicable, therefore, it requires no 

heightened review.  The exact opposite is true. 

Such an exaction only amplifies the risk that 

the government hasn't tailored its exaction to a 

project's impacts, and that cries out for 

Nollan/Dolan review. 

Finally, upholding the lower court's 

decision would just invite the government to 

monetize across the country all of their permit 

exactions and to preset legislative fees in 

order to escape heightened review.  The 

exception would swallow the rule. 

All permit exactions, whether monetary

should be subject to Nollan and Dolan to ensure 

the government doesn't take more than it is 

entitled to under its police power to mitigate

 for land use impacts.  The Court should reverse

 and remand with instructions to apply heightened

 review to the court -- to the county's fee.

 I look forward to the Court's

 questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do we have to decide 

any more than whether Nollan/Dolan scrutiny 

applies to -- can apply here to legislative 

exaction? 

MR. BEARD: Justice Thomas, the Court 

is -- is able to just answer the question 

presented, which is simply whether there's some 

kind of a legislative generally applicable 

exception to Nollan and Dolan, yes. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  If -- if the -- if --

if Respondent concedes that, is there anything 

else we should do? 

MR. BEARD: There's nothing for the 

Court to do.  That is the question presented.

primary point that there is no legislative

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In all --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- fundamental --

oh, sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just

 going to say, in -- in all of the other takings 

cases, there was an identifiable property

 interest that was at issue.  So, unless your 

argument is that money is property, this is a 

very different application of the Takings 

Clause, isn't it? 

MR. BEARD: We -- we think it's --

it's very consistent with the Takings Clause 

and, in particular, with the Court's decision in 

Koontz, where -- where the Court held 

explicitly, if the money demand has a direct 

link to an identifiable property interest, which 

in that case and in this case was the land that 

was proposed for use, that direct link is 

sufficient to render the mone- -- monetary 

demand a monetary exaction subject to Nollan and 

Dolan. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it 

involves land, but they're not taking any

 particular property interest.  They're not 

taking any part of the land. They're not taking 

an easement. It's just use to which the land is 

-- is being put. You can argue it's the value 

of the land, but, you know -- and even in the 

other cases where we're talking about money, 

it's usually money in a particular pot, whether

 it -- it's, you know, in the legal fees case or 

-- or those sorts of situations. 

I -- I don't think there's another 

case under Nollan and Dolan and Koontz where 

what's involved is simply value as opposed to a 

concrete, identifiable property interest. 

MR. BEARD: It's true that it is 

Koontz that we are relying on for that 

identifiable property interest link to the 

property demand.  It comes within the unique 

context of a land use permitting process where 

there -- there's a concern about the improper 

leveraging of the permit to extort money or 

land. 

And as Koontz again said, so long as a 

monetary demand operates on or burdens a 

particular piece of property, as in Koontz and 

as here, that is sufficient to --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Could your --

 There's all -- and Koontz was very clear that, 

I'm quoting from it, "This case does not affect 

the ability of government to impose property

 taxes, user fees, and similar laws and 

regulations that may impose financial burdens on 

property owners." 

Now I don't think we need to reach 

this question, but it wasn't really argued below 

and it wasn't even argued in the presentation on 

cert of what's the difference between this and 

those kinds of impositions. 

MR. BEARD: Justice Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I can see 

arguments on both sides, but I -- I -- I don't 

understand why the essence of Koontz isn't what 

the Chief observed, which is are -- is the state 

taking for its own personal use your property, 

an identified piece of property? Money has 

never been viewed as that way.  A -- a --

MR. BEARD: -- on which it was

 operating.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it was either

tied to a property interest that the state --

the government was going to take over. 

MR. BEARD: That is not a reasonable 

reading of -- of Koontz.  It wasn't the tie 

between the monetary demand and the in lieu 

request for a dedication of real property.  It 

was the tie between the monetary demand 

operating on the property owner's land. It was 

burdening and operating on his land because he 

was seeking a permit, a valuable permit --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was going to

 property, the Takings Clause is implicated?

 MR. BEARD: I would frame it more

 narrowly, Justice Jackson.  I would say that

 anytime the government, in the land use

 permitting context, appropriates money for the 

purpose of mitigating a land use, that is

 subject to Nollan, Dolan, and Koontz and -- and

 the requirement -- requirement for the

 government to show that it's -- what it's doing 

is mitigation --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  I understand 

your argument is that Nollan and Dolan applies 

in that situation.  But what if I believe that 

Nollan and Dolan only applies when the Takings 

Clause is implicated? 

Because what we're talking about here 

is the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and 

so the condition has to be unconstitutional in 

order to even implicate the Nollan -- at least 

the way that I read the cases. 

So what I'm trying to understand is, 

what is unconstitutional about a county saying, 

if you want to build in this way, because of the 

impacts on the traffic or environment or 

whatever, you have to pay a fee?

 that would be kind of the -- the taking part?

argument that was solely about the taking of

 money that was unrelated.

 MR. BEARD: What I was referring to in

 the -- in the example of the government 

unilaterally requesting or demanding that money 

be put to a particular use outside the 

permitting process, I was referring to the 

predicate for the unconstitutional conditions 

doctrine. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MR. BEARD: And it's our view that --

that if the government had -- had demanded money 

or actually taken money, as it has here, to put 

to a public use, because of his ownership of the 

land, that that would be a taking under the 

Koontz rationale, which is, when there is this 

demand linked to a particular piece of property, 

that can rise to the level of a protectable 

interest under the Takings Clause.

MR. BEARD: It -- it certainly --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- a type of easement 

on the property that prohibits any building?

 MR. BEARD: It certainly could be

 characterized that way because, if -- if he

 doesn't -- if he doesn't pay the ransom, he

 can't build.  And so, in that sense, there is a 

complete annihilation of his use.  As I put it 

in -- in my opening, it's -- it's this terrible 

choice between having to -- to pay $23,000 or 

give up his right to build.  So, in that sense, 

he is precluded from building if he doesn't pay.

Alito is proposing to you is different, I think,

easement in exchange, or you can pay the money.

know, we want an easement, we're taking your

just as in Nollan and Dolan, is that the county 

actually was interested in possession of the 

land, a dedicated easement for some reason.

circumstances. And in Koontz, they said, okay, 

fine, you don't have to give us the land, you 

can give us money in lieu of giving us the land.

 But I didn't understand that dynamic

 to be what is happening here.  This seems to me 

more like a property tax or a user fee that they

 say -- you know, a toll or something that --

that if you build on your land in this way, it's

 going to cause certain impacts, and so, in order 

to permit you to do that building, you need to 

pay for the fee. 

MR. BEARD: Right.  And -- and -- and 

this is an impact -- impact mitigation 

requirement.  The precedents teach us that when 

there is an impact mitigation requirement that, 

yes, the government does have the police power 

to mitigate for impacts, but it can't ask for 

something else or something beyond mitigation. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  It can't ask for 

something unconstitutional.  It can't ask for 

something it couldn't have asked for --

MR. BEARD: Correct.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So that's why I

 asked you why is it unconstitutional for them to

 impose a fee, a user fee, a toll.  What your --

your argument is suggesting that every toll is

MR. BEARD: No.

           JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- property tax is a

 taking.

 MR. BEARD: No. Taxes and user fees 

and other kinds of levies, they're entirely 

different on the basis of the -- the -- the 

power that's being invoked, the state or local 

procedures pursuant to which they're being 

invoked, the functional object of the thing 

that's being levied.  So, for example, a tax 

generally is to raise revenues.  It's not to 

mitigate impacts to land use. 

A user fee is used to compensate the 

government or reimburse the government for a --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  To mitigate impacts 

MR. BEARD: -- a service or product --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- to mitigate 

impacts for -- for users. 

MR. BEARD: But it's not, because a

user fee -- in California, for example, the 

Constitution defines a user fee as the provision 

of a good or service to the payer and to nobody 

else. That is not what is happening here.

 Everyone use the roads, and Mr. Sheetz 

may not even use the roads that are being 

improved with his fee. So all of those other 

taxes, user fees, financial obligations examples

 are totally distinct.  And as Koontz --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the Court has made 

clear that user fees generally don't have to be 

calibrated to individual people's uses, right? 

That --

MR. BEARD: True. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- a legislature can 

make an overall judgment about the way in which 

categories of people use various services. 

And I think what Justice Jackson is 

saying is, why shouldn't we understand what 

happened here in exactly that way?  That, 

actually, this scheme is highly reticulated, but 

it's a judgment about how different categories 

of people, you know, some people who are 

building single residential homes and some 

business owners and some churches and, you know,

many different categories of people, they've 

made evaluations of how -- how much those people 

are going to use the roads, are going to 

increase the burden on the roads, and so how

 much they have to pay.

 And that seems like a pretty classic 

-- I mean, I'm sure different counties and

 places have different terminologies for

 different sorts of fees, but the concept of that 

is a user fee.  We're making a judgment that you 

and other people that fit within your category 

are going to use the roads X amount, and so you 

should have to pay Y amount. 

MR. BEARD: That is to give a meaning 

to a user fee that -- that just doesn't exist 

in -- in any jurisdiction of which we're aware. 

A user fee is very specifically 

defined.  It has -- it has its own procedures. 

It has its own standard of review to determine 

whether it is a taking if it goes beyond what's 

reasonably allowed in terms of the cost. 

No one has ever claimed in this case 

that this is anything but mitigation.  No one 

ever claimed, including the county, the lower 

courts, that this was something like a user fee.

Then this goes to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.

 MR. BEARD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  User fees in my

 mind, the essence of them is, I'm using

 something, I should pay for that use.  You're

 using public roads that go -- are going to have 

to be built because you build this kind of

 project, you're going to have to use public 

roads. 

When I pay a toll, generally, I pay a 

toll, it's now in New York $10, I can go a block 

or I can go one exit or I can go 10 exits, I'm 

paying the same $10.  No one's looking at my 

individual project -- trip and saying you're 

only using it for a fraction of a moment. 

You're going to say that comes under 

the rough proportionality.  But it doesn't. 

What's being judged is the project as a whole. 

And this is what the government's doing. 

So I said to you this hasn't really 

been fleshed out below, but the concept that has 

to be addressed is what's the essence of a user 

fee. I personally don't see that as very 

different in impact.

And -- but the question is, when a 

court is reviewing that, is it reviewing it for

 reasonableness, proportionality, or is it

 reviewing it for impact on an individual 

property? And I don't see how it can be that. 

So this may be a hybrid, and we may have to look 

at it someday, but it is not pure one side or

 the other.

 MR. BEARD: Justice Sotomayor, I -- I 

think your example just highlights the fact that 

user fees, like a toll, it's a -- it's a kind of 

user fee, there's no question about that, but it 

highlights the fact that, yes, user fees are 

subject to more lax review. 

What we're talking about entirely is 

the heartland of land use regulation where the 

government holds a permit over the property 

owner's head, a very valuable permit, and says 

we'll give you your right to build --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, that's quite --

MR. BEARD: -- so long as you pay us.

quite right, that in these kinds of cases we're

 But -- but still you have to show that 

outside the permitting process there would be a

 taking.  I mean, that's when -- and I think

 you've agreed to that already.  I don't think

 you disagree with that.  That would -- so you

 need a taking outside the permitting process in 

order then to say, oh, gosh, in this permitting 

process, what the government is trying to do is 

leverage its power to force people to give up 

their right to just compensation. 

But you need the right to just 

compensation to exist, and the question is, 

where do you get that right when it's only what 

seems to me a highly articulated user fee 

scheme? 

MR. BEARD: We get the right from the 

fact that the government has required the owner 

of a particular piece of property to dedicate 

money to public use.  And in -- in this case, as 

we've seen in this case, the government can 

mitigate for land uses, but what it cannot do is 

-- is impose a burden that should be shared by 

the public as a whole on a select few. Who are 

the select few?  The minority of land use

enactments and there are legislative enactments,

 and they -- some apply to a very broad category

 of -- of property, and some apply -- some could 

apply to a very narrow category of property.

 And -- and my question is whether you 

think that the test that applies to a 

legislative enactment that applies to a category 

of property should be the same as the one that 

applies in the permitting process, where there 

is an individualized determination. 

So let me give you two examples.  You 

have a law like this that imposes a fee, a -- a 

particular fee, a set fee, on anybody who builds 

a tiny house, like 500 square feet.  I don't 

know how many square feet a tiny house has, but 

a tiny house, okay?  Everybody -- they do a 

study and they figure out that people on average 

who have these tiny houses have X number of cars 

and they calculate that.  Or they have one, 

anybody who wants to build anything pays the 

same fee. So the person who wants to build a 

tiny house pays the same amount as somebody who 

wants to build a 20,000-foot house. 

How would you apply it in those two 

situations?

           MR. BEARD: Justice Alito, in both

 circumstances, is the fee being applied to 

mitigate the use of the land?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.

 MR. BEARD: There -- there would be no 

difference that I can perceive in those two 

examples. In each case, the government would

 need to show -- if challenged, the government

 would need to show nexus and rough 

proportionality. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  On an individualized 

basis on -- for legislative categorical 

enactments, the same standard that you would 

apply to a -- a permit? 

MR. BEARD: Well -- well, the 

"individualized determination" language comes 

from Dolan, as -- as Your Honor knows, and it 

requires some sort of individualized 

determination.  That is a substantive standard 

as we view it that -- just requires that the 

focus be on the individual parcel or property in 

question. 

So the -- the inquiry is never is 

there a -- a -- a connection between the fee and 

a broad class of -- of properties as different

is not the inquiry under Dolan. What we would

 insist on is that the same standard --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, under Dolan, of

 course -- I mean, I'm -- I'm very interested in

 this exact same question.  Let's assume that

 there was a taking.  Let's just put that aside,

 the questions that we've been talking about. 

And let's assume that you're right that there's 

some kind of unconstitutional conditions 

doctrine that does apply to generally applicable 

legislation, right? 

And then I think what Justice Alito is 

saying is, why would it be the exact same kind 

of unconstitutional conditions requirement, 

test, evaluation, what have you, when we're not 

talking about an individual permitting decision, 

but we're talking about a generally applicable 

scheme?  I mean, the legislature has decided to 

cut across a wide swath of individuals. 

What would it mean to do parcel-based 

Nollan/Dolan in that context and why would we do 

parcel-based Nollan/Dolan in that context?  Why 

wouldn't we ask more generally about the 

proportionality or reasonableness or whatever

 it be an easement or some fee, just because it

would think, you would have to look at the size

 MR. BEARD: I -- I don't think that is 

correct, Justice Kagan, because a well-crafted,

 granular, legislative impact fee schedule could 

pass muster under Nollan and Dolan's heightened

 review.  Why? Because, if -- if -- if it's

 based on, say, a group of development that is 

sufficiently granular, all of the members of

 that group, say single-family homes between 1200 

to 1500 square feet, produce the same kinds of 

impacts, and it's not this broad-brushed 

category of all development pays $50,000. 

That kind of a fee is sufficiently 

individualized, has a sufficient individualized 

justification for the fee in the range.  And 

that -- that derives from the rough 

proportionality standard.  What is rough 

proportionality?  It means that any given 

project's impacts could have a range of fees so 

long as it's roughly proportionate to the impact 

of that project.

think that you just suggested no, you wouldn't 

really have to do it piece by piece by piece as

 long as you had the right categories.

 But I think I'm going to suggest that 

-- that this scheme is highly reticulated. You

 know, I'm just going to read you all the

 categories:  singly -- single-family

 residential, multi-family residential, high trip 

commercial, general commercial, office, 

industrial, warehouse, church, gas station, golf 

course, campground, bed and breakfast. 

Those are a lot of categories.  And, 

you know, so what's wrong with a county doing 

exactly this?  We're going to set up lots of 

different categories that reflect how much use 

we think different enterprises and activities 

use -- how much use they -- they -- they -- they 

put on the roads, and then we're going to charge 

them fees, and there's going to be some 

averages.  Some people are going to pay a little 

bit more than they should.  Some people are 

going to pay a little bit less. 

But, you know, except if we're going 

to go house by house by house, that seems to be 

what a county would do.

MR. BEARD: So the problem with the 

fee that was imposed on Mr. Sheetz, yes, they

 have categories, and he falls into the

 single-family category, although they -- they

 group all single-family homes together, for

 example.  Any -- anything from, I don't know,

 four -- 400 to 500 square feet to 5,000, 6,000 

square feet, all of them have the same impacts.

 But the fundamental problem is the 

burden-shifting.  The -- they -- they -- the 

county specifically and purposely shifted the 

burden of traffic impacts from non-residential, 

retail, office, other commercial, on to new 

residential. 

And the reason they said they did it 

was because we -- we don't want to discourage 

new commercial from coming in to our -- our 

jurisdiction.  We don't want to overburden them 

with impact fees. Let's just shift the burden 

over to residential.  It's that kind of 

burden-shifting that reveals that the fee 

actually was not tailored to Mr. Sheetz's house.

 Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I just want to make 

sure I understand that last exchange and some

 others like it.  We're dealing here with a

 legislative challenge, a challenge to a piece of 

legislation, but, of course, in Dolan, there was 

legislation that executive actors were pursuing,

 and, in fact, executive actors usually pursue 

takings or any other action pursuant to 

legislation. 

And so whether it's legislative or an 

executive action, we're dealing with a law, and 

the question is whether it's proportional.  And 

one thing that might go to proportionality in a 

specific case, because you're not making an --

facial challenge, you're making an as-applied 

challenge, is how carefully reticulated it is to 

your circumstance. 

Is -- is that a fair summary of the --

of the question once we move past the QP? 

MR. BEARD: Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And I -- I 

think a lot of what Justice Kagan and others 

have said might well go to proportionality and 

make this proportional.

 MR. BEARD: On remand, the county

 could certainly argue that the fee that was

 to his impacts.

on that?  If you win on the idea that

 legislative exactions are subject to 

Nollan/Dolan and you win on impact fees are

 subject to Nollan/Dolan, then it comes down to 

how do you apply the nexus and rough

 proportionality test that Justice Kagan, Justice 

Alito, Justice Gorsuch have been asking you

 about.

 And I found your reply brief -- well, 

first of all, the amicus briefs of the states 

and of the American Planning Association, for 

example, say in essence, paraphrasing, it would 

be a total disaster to try to do that on a 

parcel-specific basis and would really destroy 

the concept of imposing impact fees for new 

development. 

And in your reply brief, I thought you 

came back on page 16 and said:  while "a fee 

based on classes of development can survive 

Nollan/Dolan, a fee schedule premised on a range 

of fees for different development classes will 

not necessarily run afoul of Nollan/Dolan."  And 

that -- and I think you've repeated that today. 

And then you have a sentence:  "Of

the government must make an individualized 

determination that the fee as applies to his

 project satisfies Nollan/Dolan."

 So I view those two things as 

inconsistent in that paragraph, and I'm trying 

to kind of drill down on what exactly are you 

saying needs to be shown by a county when it has 

a fee schedule or formula in order to show rough

 proportionality? 

MR. BEARD: When challenged, it needs 

to show that the fee, once -- the fee from the 

schedule bears an essential nexus and rough 

proportionality to the impacts of the proposed 

development before it. 

So getting to that last sentence that 

Your Honor read, the idea is that many 

jurisdictions, Texas is one of them, they had 

what I would call default. Illinois has it too. 

Default legislative impact fee schedules. 

They have very well-crafted, detailed 

impact fee schedules.  They don't do this weird 

burden-shifting for political reasons.  And then 

an applicant has the opportunity to say:  Well, 

hold on, I think that fee is excessive given the 

impacts of this project.

Now, if it's well-articulated and

 well-crafted, you're not going to see many

 challenges from developers, especially the --

the mid- to -- to larger-sized developers.  But 

you may have the occasional one.

 And in that circumstance, certainly,

 the government would need to show that its fee 

is roughly proportionate to the impacts, the fee 

that it drew from the legislative fee schedule.

 But, to go to your point, the county 

itself in 2019 realized that it could be better 

crafted by creating single-family homes 

categorized by square footage, and that makes

 common sense, whereas before it said

 administrative problems, too costly.  Now we see 

that they're going in that direction.

 And all applying Nollan and Dolan will 

do is keep governments honest and to make sure 

that they're actually doing the work of creating 

fees where an individual project will come 

before it and, yeah, that -- that fee from the 

schedule will be roughly proportional.

 to -- you're trying to mitigate the potential

 consequences of that.

 I mean, when you're deciding how 

reticulated it has to be, would the lines drawn

 between various categories be judged on a 

rational basis level? Because it seems like 

you're saying, well, you look at whether the 

category is roughly proportional, but, as 

Justice Kavanaugh's pointing out, individual 

parcels within that category may have varying 

impacts on the traffic. 

So how do you decide where the lines 

should be drawn? 

MR. BEARD: Well, I think --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Is it 

proportionality?  Is that your answer? 

MR. BEARD: Proportionality as to the 

particular project and rough proportionality as 

to the particular project.  So, as I said, there 

could be a fee within a category to which that 

project belongs that may be roughly 

proportionate.  It doesn't have to be exact.  It 

could be roughly proportionate. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.

The other question that I have is 

about how much your argument is tied to the fact 

this arises in the permitting context.  So let's 

imagine that instead of tying this traffic 

impact exaction to granting the permit, let's 

say that your client builds the home and then, 

after that, so a permit's been granted and 

fallen out of the picture, the county comes back 

and says, we're going to have a special 

assessment applicable to everybody in this 

development of X amount of money, say it's the 

same 20 whatever thousand dollars that your 

client paid to cover traffic impacts. 

Does that implicate Nollan/Dolan?

 implicate the Nollan/Dolan tests, and -- and --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But do you think it 

might be a taking or implicate the Takings

 Clause?

 MR. BEARD: Well, as I said earlier, I

 don't know that any monetary appropriation is

 carte blanche exempt from the Takings Clause. 

The question really comes down to, has the 

government, in exercising its assessment power, 

its tax power, police power, has it exceeded 

what it's entitled to under that power?  And --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So property taxes 

too? 

MR. BEARD: Property taxes, one case 

that was cited in Koontz from 1960, Brushaber, 

said yeah, the progressive tax is 

constitutional.  There's no taking.  We could 

imagine a situation where it becomes so 

confiscatory that that portion of it may become 

a taking.  So that's just to say that taxes 

generally are as a matter -- just as a matter of 

fact exempt. You're not going to mount a very 

strong takings challenge to a -- a take -- a 

tax.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I'm 

really, really confused now because I did not

 understand the taking question constitutionally, 

the way that we analyze it and think about it,

 to be a matter of has the government overstepped 

its authority.  I -- I thought that takings were 

the dedication of private property to public use 

for which the government would have to pay just 

compensation. 

MR. BEARD: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So, if 

that's the case, then it seems to me we have to 

have that kernel of thing happening in whatever 

scenario that you say Nollan and Dolan applies. 

And I don't understand why that's 

happening in a situation like the one that 

Justice Barrett articulated or any of the toll 

situations.  So, for example, in this very case, 

instead of a fee schedule at the beginning for a 

-- a single-use person like your client, the

riding on the roads upfront via this fee

 schedule, we'll make him pay every time he comes

 Taking, in your perspective?

 MR. BEARD: That sounds to me like a

 user fee that is occurring outside the land use

 permitting context with a special --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  It's not outside the 

land use -- it's not outside land use because 

he's only doing this, as the Chief Justice 

posited, because he has to come there in order 

to get to his house. 

MR. BEARD: I don't conceive of that 

as -- as being within the heartland of land use 

permitting.  Land use permitting is kind of a 

very defined world where you go for a permit to 

use your property, you need the government's 

permission to do so, and the government extorts 

something in return. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But doesn't the 

something have to be a dedicated use of the 

property in order for the Takings Clause --

way as a part of conditioning, what -- what is 

the just compensation part of this? 

MR. BEARD: Well, it's -- the just 

compensation part of it is that the government 

has appropriated a sum of money for which it 

owes compensation, a refund.

to this scenario is coming from the fact that 

it's really not a taking scenario in that you

 as the reason why the government shouldn't be 

able to do this.

the burden-shifting is the problem in response 

to Justice Kagan. 

At one point, you said, you know, this 

is about keeping the government honest.  There 

are other claims in the law that do that work, 

right? If you were unfairly singled out, you 

could bring an Equal Protection Clause claim. 

But I just don't know that takings is what is 

doing the work for you here in terms of 

challenging the government's program. 

MR. BEARD: Well, we think the Takings 

Clause does apply because the Takings Clause --

the animating principle is you don't select a 

few to bear public burdens that should be borne 

by the -- borne by the public as a whole.  And

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AILEEN M. McGRATH

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. McGRATH: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Like countless local governments 

across the country, the County of El Dorado 

charges a fee to developers to address the 

impacts of new development using a predetermined 

schedule, as Justice Kagan has -- has 

emphasized, reticulated by geographic zone and 

development type. 

As the findings below make clear, the 

programmatic fee in this case does not pay for 

road improvements generally.  It pays for only 

those improvements necessary to alleviate 

increased traffic from new development. 

Neither precedent nor principle

 supports, much less compels, applying

 Nollan/Dolan's individualized test to those

 programmatic fees.  In centuries' worth of

 precedent, this Court has reiterated that 

governments can charge fees to property owners, 

such as special assessments to fund public

 improvements and user fees to fund government

 services.

 This Court has always held that those 

fees, which are indistinguishable from the fee 

at issue, are not takings.  Without that 

predicate for application of the 

unconstitutional conditions doctrine, 

Nollan/Dolan cannot apply. 

More fundamentally, the county's 

impact fee shares all of the key features with 

the other property taxes, user fees, and similar 

property-based charges that this Court has 

cordoned off from Nollan/Dolan review.  It is 

imposed by the legislature subject to an array 

of state law requirements and applies to all 

similar new development in the county based on 

the legislature's finding that new development 

creates the need for and will benefit from the 

road improvements the fee will fund.  And,

critically, it does not attempt to obtain any

 dedication of real property.

 Petitioner would disregard those 

limiting features and expand Nollan/Dolan to

 commonplace impact fees.  But doing so would 

have dire consequences for land use planning.

 Forcing local governments to justify a

 programmatic fee on a parcel-by-parcel basis 

would disrupt, if not destroy, their ability to 

fund capital-intensive infrastructure necessary 

to serve new development, bringing such 

development to a grinding halt.  The Takings 

Clause does not compel that sea change. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

imagine or identify scenarios where the 

legislature might effect a taking on a

 programmatic basis, we would not bring those

 kinds of -- of, you know, unusual scenarios 

within our rule, but our position is that this

seems that much of your argument actually goes

opposed to its origins in legislation.

that the legislature categorically has some sort 

of insulation from what Nollan/Dolan requires. 

Our position is that when the 

legislature acts in this case as the legislature 

has in a way that is functionally and 

constitutionally indistinguishable from the way 

that the legislature acts in instances where the 

Court has already said that Nollan/Dolan does 

not apply, that that is the reason that 

Nollan/Dolan does not apply in this context.

argument could have been made in Nollan and

 Dolan. You -- you could have made the same 

argument that this type of tax in that case

 that -- from an ordinance or from a local

 regulation was exempt because of the nature of

 the exaction.

 MS. McGRATH: I don't think so,

 Justice Thomas.  I think, in each of those 

cases, I think the primary distinction we would 

point to is that each of those cases, as already 

has been discussed today, purported to apply the 

unconstitutional conditions framework, which 

means that the question of each of -- of those 

cases is, is the permit condition effectuating a 

taking that the government would have to pay for 

if it effectuated outside the permit process. 

That answer is not answered by looking 

at whether there is some sort of legislation --

legislative authorization present somewhere at 

the -- in the scheme.  It is looking at what 

that condition does, and I think that --

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question

 presented is whether a permit exaction is exempt 

from the unconstitutional conditions doctrine as 

applied in Nollan and Dolan simply because it is

 authorized by legislation.

 You said the answer to that is no,

 that the -- the fact that it's legislation does 

not give it an automatic exemption.  Your 

friend's answer is no for the same reason. 

MS. McGRATH: Well, I think today I 

heard my friend's answer to be more candid, just 

as it is in his brief, is that his position is 

that any permit condition that is imposed on a 

development permit is subject to Nollan/Dolan. 

That is what he said on page 44 in the 

blue brief and the relief that he is asking from 

this Court.  It's also the -- the relief that I 

heard him asking for this morning. 

And so, in answering the question 

presented, I think what that highlights is that 

the question is not whether legislative -- some 

sort of legislative authorization somewhere in 

the scheme categorically exempts permit

 The question is whether this kind of

 legislation, which is ubiquitous and commonly

 used, is subject to Nollan/Dolan.  And, there, I

 would also refer back to what the question

 presented says about the unconstitutional

 conditions doctrine.

 The question is whether what the --

which requires a determination that the 

condition that the government is imposing would 

be a taking if it were performed outside of the 

permitting context, and, here, you know, we 

think the answer is no. 

But, as I said, more fundamentally, 

the Court has said before that certain kinds of 

legislation -- property taxes, special 

assessments, user fees -- are categorically 

outside of Nollan/Dolan, and our position --

user fee is a really interesting question.

 But, as I read the court of appeals 

below, they said we're not even going to get 

into any of that because Nollan and Dolan simply

 doesn't apply to legislative enactments of any

 kind, whether it's a tax, whether it's a fee, 

whether it's something else.

 And I thought we had taken the case to 

address that question. And as the Chief Justice 

has pointed out, I think there's radical 

agreement on that question today. 

MS. McGRATH: I -- I think, if you 

read --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And so why wouldn't 

-- what would be wrong with allowing both sides 

to go back and make their arguments, recognizing 

that Nollan and Dolan does apply to some 

legislative enactments, and then we can -- you 

can go back to the courts below and talk about 

whether this is a tax, whether it's a user fee, 

or whether it isn't, but that there's just no 

categorical exemption from legislative

QP that we're being asked to decide and if we

odd opinion to write where it was not the rule 

that was applied below.  But I'll take the 

hypothetical.  And even there, I think what --

what -- what is apparent from the briefing and 

what you hear from the arguments today is that 

the core of this disagreement is about whether 

all permit conditions are or are not subject to 

Nollan/Dolan.  That's the very premise of the 

QP, is whether there's an exemption --

Dolan, for example, administrative agents said 

you have to give me a 15-foot strip to -- access

 to the beach.  That -- that was subject to an

 unconstitutional conditions analysis.

 And the only difference between that 

and this is that, there, you had an executive

 actor who was applying a legislative command, 

and, here, you have an executive actor applying

 maybe a more specific or -- or -- or more 

obvious legislative command.  But, in both 

instances, there are executive actors applying 

legislative commands, and we're being asked, I 

think, just to decide whether that makes a 

difference. 

MS. McGRATH: I think that what 

happened in Nollan/Dolan and Koontz all looks 

fundamentally different from what the county is 

doing in -- is doing here in a way that I think 

bears on what you are getting at, Justice 

Gorsuch, which is that what the -- what the 

governments were doing in Nollan/Dolan and 

Koontz looks fundamentally different from the 

county's scheme, which is indistinguishable from 

property taxes, user fees, and special 

assessments.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Wouldn't that --

 wouldn't --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Counsel, I -- I -- I'm 

puzzled by your statements about what the court

 below held.  It said over and over again that 

Nollan and Dolan do not apply to legislation.

 "Only individualized development fees

 as distinguished from legislatively mandated 

generally applicable development fees are 

subject to the Nollan/Dolan test."  That's on 

page 407. 

On 409, "While the Nollan/Dolan test 

applies to monetary land loose" -- "land use 

exactions which are imposed ad hoc on an 

individual and discretionary basis, it does not 

apply to generally applicable development impact 

fees imposed through legislative action. 

"As our Supreme Court has explained, 

legislatively prescribed monetary fees as 

distinguished from a monetary condition imposed 

on an individual permit application on an ad hoc 

basis that are imposed as a condition of 

development are not subject to the Nollan/Dolan 

test."

 I agree with you, but that's what

 Justice Alito was saying.  They started from

 a -- from a broader sense of saying there can

 never be a taking if it's generalized --

 generalized imposition by a legislature.  And

 that's just not true.

that -- well, if they didn't apply that rule --

well, let's start over. 

Let's assume that legislative 

exactions are covered by Nollan/Dolan.  And then 

you want to say, but impact fees, I think, are 

exempt from Nollan/Dolan.  Right? 

MS. McGRATH: That's correct.

MS. McGRATH: I do think the Due 

Process Clause would provide a check there.  And 

I also think that the Court could reason by 

analogy to the special assessment and the user 

fee cases, where the Court has made clear that 

despite the deference that legislatures receive 

in this area, they have to act reasonably.  And 

those reasonable limits include, for instance, 

in -- in the user fee context, that if you --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you think it's 

reasonable to impose impact fees that are not 

designed to fund, say, the road that needs to be 

built because of the development but to fund 

improvements to schools on the other part --

exclusively on new development.  And here again, 

I would point to the special assessment cases

when the government is charging fees to a 

specific group of property owners, that is based 

on its determination, subject to reasonableness,

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What's the 

difference between reasonableness as you're 

describing it and rough proportionality and

 essential -- and nexus?

 MS. McGRATH: I -- I think it -- I --

and I think that actually touches on kind of the 

core of what our dispute is here, which I think 

your earlier questions were also touching on,

 Justice Kavanaugh, is that we do not dispute as 

a matter of state law or federal law that there 

has to be a connection between new development 

and the fees that the county charges. 

What we do dispute is that then, when 

the legislature has to justify how it imposed 

that -- those -- imposes those fees, that it has 

to do that on a parcel-by-parcel basis. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So the 

whole dispute then, I think, does come down to 

-- we can use the adjectives, but you agree 

rough proportionality has to apply, I think, and 

-- and nexus. You say not Nollan/Dolan, but you 

say the same words as Nollan/Dolan apply. 

But the key dispute then is do we do 

that by looking at the formula to see whether 

the formula is roughly proportional, as Justice

Kagan was saying, or do we have to go to the 

individual house and say, well, what about the

 impacts of that house on the road?

 MS. McGRATH: Right.  I mean -- and 

just to be clear, as I think everyone 

understands, we dispute that there is any taking 

anywhere in the picture, and so we would dispute 

that any sort of constitutional principle in

 addition to due process reasonableness 

protections applies. 

But it -- but accepting the 

hypothetical or -- or answering, I think, more 

directly the question, is, yes, the -- the core 

practical problem that this would create for 

counties is that it -- it would disable counties 

from acting on the predetermined bases that they 

routinely act in this context and that they need 

to be able to use to fund the kind of 

infrastructure improvements that we are talking 

about, schools, sewer systems, roads.

-- from tagging new developers exclusively to 

pay for entirely unrelated public improvements.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Sorry.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, that's all

 right. Sorry.

 So Justice Kavanaugh has been

 discussing the sort of core practical problem of

 how do we figure out when the county has 

overstepped and gone too far and there must be a 

limit. And all of that is true, but I guess I'm 

concerned about the core legal problem that is 

the threshold question of which test should 

apply when given the claims that are being made 

by Mr. Sheetz in this case. 

And so that takes me back to wondering 

whether the most straightforward way to win in 

this case from your perspective is not 

necessarily to prove that this is a tax or prove 

that this is, you know, a user fee but to say 

this is not a taking. 

We have very clear, very 

well-established legal principles as to what 

qualifies as a taking.  And whatever this is, I 

think we can say that since it isn't the kind of

Nollan, Dolan, and Koontz, that it's not a 

taking, so this particular formula doesn't

 apply.

 It -- isn't that the most

 straightforward? Like, Justice Gorsuch was --

was starting to investigate your position that 

this qualifies as a tax. And so then we have to 

sort of figure out, well, what does that mean 

and is it a tax? Can't you win by just saying 

this is not a taking? 

MS. McGRATH: Yes.  Absolutely.  We 

would welcome that opinion.  That is our 

position.  And the reason that we invoke the tax 

and the property tax and special assessment 

contexts is that the Court has categorically 

said those are not takings.  But, absolutely, we 

agree. There -- put -- even putting all that to 

the side, there is no possible taking here.

 that due process -- procedural due process 

operates in this area, but it operates at a

 highly -- highly generalized level that requires

 counties to do things like enact legislation,

So what there is radical agreement on 

is that you don't get a pass from 

unconstitutional conditions analysis just

 because you've passed generally applicable

 legislation.  And that's, of course, true in 

unconstitutional conditions analysis generally, 

and so too it's true of unconstitutional 

conditions analysis in the property area. If

 there has been a taking and that taking is being 

leveraged in the permitting process by generally 

applicable legislation, there's no pass just 

because that's the mechanism that's being used. 

So, first, let me ask you if you agree 

with that? 

MS. McGRATH: I agree. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Here are two 

things it seems to me that the parties 

fundamentally disagree on, which is probably --

one of these two things is going to answer this 

dispute in the end, but there are two things. 

Is -- number one, was -- is there a taking at 

all? Because if this is just something like a 

tax, unconstitutional conditions analysis never 

comes into play, and you say it never comes into 

play, and Mr. Beard says it absolutely comes

into play.  So that's one question that you're

 very much at odds on, is that correct?

 MS. McGRATH: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The second question 

that you're very much at odds on is, even if you 

assume that there has been some kind of taking 

here and that unconstitutional analysis does

 come into play -- and by that, I mean what we

 have in past cases called Nollan/Dolan analysis, 

right? 

Even if you assume that that 

unconstitutional analysis comes into play, it 

might look very different from what Nollan/Dolan 

analysis looks like just because Nollan and 

Dolan were focused on individual parcels, 

individual property owners, and this is a 

general scheme, and it would be very difficult 

to apply Nollan and Dolan analysis literally to 

a general scheme so that there might be ways in 

which Nollan/Dolan analysis becomes something 

that, you know, really looks different in 

application.  And I think Mr. Beard says no, not 

really, and you say, yes, really.  Is that 

correct? 

MS. McGRATH:  That's also correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice --

 Justice Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's super helpful 

because, as I read it, and I may be the only 

one, though I don't think so, the only QP was on 

the first question, whether Nollan/Dolan applies 

to legislative enactments.  There -- there was a 

circuit split.  That's -- that we -- that's why 

we took the case.  And we could answer that and 

be done. 

Now, if we went on, we have to decide 

whether it's a tax for the first one, and on the 

second one, we have to decide whether there's a 

difference between legislative enactments in 

gross and specific actions.  On that, I guess, I 

had a question. 

Couldn't one recharacterize what 

happened in Dolan as legislation in gross?

 ministerially apply the legislative code.

 So how are we supposed to draw a 

distinction if we're going to get -- if we're 

going to go down that road and try and decide 

that question, which I don't think is before us, 

but if we were to, how do we distinguish between

 Dolan and your case? 

MS. McGRATH: So I think there are two 

bases of distinction.  I think one relates to 

what Dolan itself decided.  And, there, I think 

that Dolan itself involved legislation that 

looks very different from the -- legislation 

here in two respects. 

And, here, I would point the Court to 

page 380 of the Dolan decision, which emphasized 

two features of that ordinance.  One was that it 

allowed for variances, significant variances 

from any sort of baseline mitigation floor that 

the legislation imposes, and, number two, it 

gave permitting officials discretion to identify 

the amount of open space that was required under 

that scheme when they think --

They just pretty much followed the rule, 15-foot

 easement, boom, you've to give us a 15-foot

 easement as I understood it.

 MS. McGRATH: I think that's also, of 

course, putting to the side the fact that that

 case involved an easement and therefore

 didn't -- didn't raise these questions.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I understand that. 

But that's all that -- that's the first can of 

worms, which we're not getting -- I mean, we 

could say that this is a tax and that's a 

different -- but this is the second can of worms 

that -- that we're talking about now, which is 

legislation versus specific, and I guess I'm not 

sure where we draw that line. 

MS. McGRATH: I think, there, the line 

that we draw, which gets to the second part of 

my answer to the first question, is on the 

non-discretionary and mandatory nature of the 

fees that were charged here. 

Here, the fees are set by a

variance existed, but they didn't vary, it would 

then be on the Dolan side of the line rather

 than your side of the line?

 MS. McGRATH: I think, if it were a --

I -- I think it's on -- the condition in Dolan

 is on the Dolan side of the line primarily

 because there's a taking.

 But, here, I think that in a case 

where there's significant discretion involved or 

variances allowed, I think that would be a 

harder case and a different one. And, here, 

we're emphasizing the non-discretionary and

know, relates primarily to the similarity to 

that.

then your due process review does, I think -- I

 just want to get back to this -- apply concepts 

like rough proportionality and essential nexus

 so long as that review is not applied at the

 parcel-specific level.  Is that correct?

 MS. McGRATH: I think we would use

 words like reasonableness or rationality rather 

than rough proportionality, but I think, Justice

your question to be suggesting there's not a 

significant difference in your mind between 

those two scenarios, in which case that -- that 

is, I think, part of -- that is part of our --

 clarify.  In your exchange with Justice Gorsuch,

 who very clearly isolated the question 

presented, as I read it, the question presented 

at least as the Petitioner put it forward is 

whether a permit exaction is exempt from the 

unconstitutional conditions doctrine simply 

because it's authorized by legislation.

 So it seems to me that there is a

 threshold assumption that the permit exaction 

would otherwise trigger the unconstitutional 

conditions doctrine, and the question is, would 

-- is it exempt from that just because of 

legislation. 

So, because there is disagreement 

about whether it would trigger it to begin with, 

I would think that to isolate the question 

presented as -- at a minimum, we would have to 

expressly preserve the assumption, right? 

I mean, our -- our holding or our 

opinion would have to say assuming that a permit 

exaction of the nature of this one triggers the 

unconstitutional, that we couldn't not say that, 

right, in order to just isolate the question 

presented?

right, Justice Jackson. I think that's part of 

the reason that we think we are directly

 answering the question presented here, because 

of that assumption that all permit conditions

 are --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And -- and if it

 turns out that the assumption is easy based on 

our case law, let's say, the Court looks at this

 and very clearly says or thinks that, you know, 

if we don't have a dedicated appropriation of 

land kind of scenario, then there is no taking, 

would you encourage us to go ahead and say that

conversation that we've been having this

 morning.

 First, on the question of how broadly

 the question presented sweeps, I certainly agree

 with you, Justice Jackson, that there is a

 logically antecedent question baked into the 

question presented, which is whether the 

unconstitutional conditions doctrine applies

 here at all.  For reasons I'd like to talk about 

in a moment, we don't think it does. 

But, if the Court doesn't want to 

reach that question, I think what's really 

important if it's going to say that there is no 

sort of legislative exception from Nollan and 

Dolan is for the Court to make clear that these 

are still cases applying, as this Court said in 

Koontz, a special application of the 

unconstitutional conditions framework. 

And so, when the parties go back 

and -- and parties across this country read this 

Court's decision, it remains clear that you have 

to identify a taking for a Nollan/Dolan claim to 

get off the ground. 

Second, I think there was some 

conversation about what is the focus of the

taking that Petitioner is suggesting here.  I

 think it was clear in his introduction this 

morning and has been clear throughout the

 briefing if you look at pages 25 to 26 in 

particular of the blue brief that he's not 

making any sort of claim regarding a taking of

 his property, meaning the physical real

 property.

 What he is claiming is that this 

$23,000 fee is itself a taking.  And we think 

that is not correct for all of the reasons that 

have already been discussed this morning and 

that many of you have recognized. 

I think this Court in Koontz talked 

about taxes, user fees, and similar laws and 

regulations, so I don't think that to prevail 

the county necessarily has to show that this is 

a tax or a user fee, but as Justice Barrett 

pointed out earlier, I think it is quite similar 

to the class of special assessments that this 

Court has held for a hundred-plus years in cases 

like Houck and Fallbrook and French are not 

subject to any sort of takings analysis or any 

heightened takings analysis.  They are subject 

to normal constitutional constraints.

And I think this goes to the point 

that no court or this Court at least to my

 knowledge has never held that a widely 

applicable fee paid by large numbers of people 

to pay for government infrastructure is a 

taking, and I think doing so in this case would

 be -- would be very disruptive. 

And I guess this gets me to the last

 and third point about the disruptiveness of the 

rule that I hear Petitioner to be asking.  I 

think he is asking for, as he has said, a 

parcel-specific analysis. 

I think that has several problems. 

The workability ones certainly have already been 

discussed, but I also think there's an element 

of horizontal fairness here.  When you have a 

class and everyone within the class pays the 

same amount, that actually can be viewed as far 

more fair than having these one-off 

individualized determinations. 

I think, in -- in a -- in adopting a 

standard that's more like what the states have 

suggested in their amicus brief should the Court 

go down the Nollan/Dolan road -- and, again, I 

want to be clear we don't think there's any

reason to do so -- but if the Court is inclined

 to do so, you know, I think it would be very

 important, one, again, to say that this has to 

operate at the class level, so the class at

 which the legislature is acting, and, two, that

 reasonable judgments, reasonable legislative 

judgments need to be able to be made regarding 

the class, how the -- how the county or the

 local government is going to allocate the 

burdens of taxation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, 

you -- you said that there would be no takings 

analysis with respect to a widely applicable 

provision that covers a large number of people. 

MS. ROSS: I think when we're talking 

about money, when we're talking about a payment 

for government services, so I think that makes 

this case look a lot like a tax user fee. 

Similar laws and regulations, as this Court said 

in Koontz on page 615 of the opinion, are 

outside of the -- the takings context and 

outside of Nollan and Dolan. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if it's 

narrowly applicable and applies only to a 

relatively small number of people, then the

 takings analysis does apply?

 MS. ROSS: No. I think the question

 is -- what I'm trying to get at is this idea of

 individualized ad hoc decision-making versus the 

broadly applicable legislative standard --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but, I

 mean, obviously, that's a broad range.  And I'm 

just trying to get a sense of exactly where you

 would have -- I mean, because this is a 

threshold determination, but if it depends on 

individualized analysis and you've got to figure 

out, well, where along that spectrum does it 

apply, that's not a very helpful threshold. 

MS. ROSS: So I think this is similar 

to analyses that the Court has conducted in 

other areas.  I mean, I think there is -- we 

cited in our brief -- I apologize, the name of 

the case is escaping me at the moment -- but, 

basically, in the due process context, we do 

draw this distinction between whether you get an 

individualized hearing because we're really 

talking about sort of one-offs or we're talking 

about class-wide legislation. 

I think what's really key here is that 

because this applies to a wide swath of

 landowners, it's done at the class level.  As I

 said earlier, it -- it has horizontal fairness 

and it has, I think, a greater responsiveness in

 the political process than you would have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So are you 

saying that if you have a provision that applies

 categorically in terms of its phraseology, but 

it turns out there are only, you know, three

 houses in the county that are going to be 

affected, that you would analyze that 

differently? 

MS. ROSS: So I'm not sure it's a --

it becomes a takings problem, Mr. Chief Justice. 

And I apologize.  I probably should have said 

that initially.  I think that, you know, that 

may have sort of a -- an arbitrariness question 

under the Due Process Clause or an equal 

protection.  Maybe it's not a class of one, 

maybe it's a class of three problem.  But there 

would be a singling out analysis.  I just don't 

think that's anything like what we have --

might be very informative when we're talking

 about a tax or a user fee and whether it meets

 But, if this were a taking -- and I'm

 not saying it is, okay?  I -- I -- I'm not sure 

we have to answer that question, as I've already

 indicated.  But, if -- if it were a taking, why

 would that make a difference?  If it actually --

if -- if -- if the legislature said, we're going 

to take everybody's property, and there's no 

question they're taking your property, how on 

earth would that be better than an 

individualized agency official saying, I'm 

taking Ms. Ross's property and no one else's? 

MS. ROSS: So, Justice Gorsuch, I 

completely agree with you that this 

consideration is not dispositive. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It's relevant when 

we get to taxes and user fees.  I accept that. 

But you'd agree that it also doesn't cut much if 

we're actually talking about a true taking? 

MS. ROSS: That's correct, Justice 

Gorsuch.  And I think that just reflects that 

this Court has sort of always treated physical 

appropriations of real property as the

quintessential taking, the classic taking, as 

this Court has said time and time again. It's

 what the -- the clause, the text of the clause 

itself, I think, is most focused --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  Thank you.

 MS. ROSS: -- on, and so it makes 

sense that we have different rules in that

 context.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  Thank you. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And so can you just 

clarify, say a little bit more about that?  I 

mean, you seem fairly confident that this is not 

a taking, so can you say exactly why that is? 

MS. ROSS: Certainly, Justice Jackson. 

So I think it's not a taking because, as I think 

I said earlier, this Court has never found a 

taking in a situation in which the government is 

charging a -- if you want to call it a tax, a 

user fee, a -- other similar law or regulation, 

to pay for public benefits, public 

infrastructure, public services. It has never 

found a taking in that context. 

I think there are a few reasons why 

that's so. First, of course, there is this sort 

of oft-repeated line that taxes are not takings.

And I think that's -- that -- that has meaning.

 And the reason it has meaning is because the

 Court has long recognized that governments need

 to be able to fund themselves and that when they 

do so, they are not engaging in, again, this 

sort of core taking physical appropriation of

 private property activity.

 I think, if you wanted to put this in

 a box -- you know, the user fee has been talked 

about a lot this morning -- I think a special 

assessment is a really good way of thinking 

about this, as I think Justice Barrett noted 

earlier.  The -- the special assessment cases 

make clear that not only can government charge 

taxes at sort of a general level, it can also do 

it, it can define a particular district, as in 

Houck and Fallbrook and the other sort of 

irrigation district cases, or it can define a 

particular class of property owners --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And does it -- does 

it matter that it's doing that in connection 

with property?  What I understood Mr. Sheetz --

Sheetz's counsel to say is that when you do that 

in connection with property, then we're sort of 

getting into takings territory.

MS. ROSS: So I don't think a link to

 property can be enough or any link to property

 can be enough.  And I -- and if I could give two

 quick examples.  I mean, I think a property tax 

obviously does that, and that has never been

 thought to be a taking.  And, similarly, I think

 a transfer tax.  I may really want to exercise

 my right as a property holder or property owner 

to sell my property, but nobody has ever thought 

that the government engages in a taking when it 

requires me to pay a certain percentage to 

Maryland or the District of Columbia or whatever 

it is when I sell my property. 

So I don't think just any link to 

property is enough.  I think, to bring this back 

to Koontz, the link to property that was really 

at issue there was the in lieu nature of the 

fee. The choice on the table was pay me an --

or give me over a real property interest, an 

easement that's going to destroy the right to 

exclude that this Court has recognized as sort 

of the core right in physical real property, or 

pay an equivalent amount of money. 

And the concern, I think, as this 

Court made clear at page 612 of the opinion,

when it was talking about the anti-circumvention

 rationale, is that if you allow the -- the

 county to do that -- that, give me one or give 

me the other, it's always going to be able to 

get the property that it wanted at the outset 

because it can just keep ratcheting up the fee.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Did you -- do you --

do you agree that the California court held that 

Nollan/Dolan does not apply to legislation? 

MS. ROSS: So, Justice Alito, with all 

due respect to the California Court of Appeal, I 

think the -- the opinion is less than clear in 

some places.  I do think there are parts of the 

opinion -- I think my friend pointed to pages 16 

to 17 if I'm remembering correctly.  There's a 

footnote that sort of analogizes this to a 

special assessment and, I think, refers to some 

of the cases that talk about the in lieu nature. 

And so, if you wanted to squint at the opinion 

and find a more nuanced rule, I think you could 

do that.

counsel.

 Justice Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One question.  The 

concern on the other side, I think, is that 

property developers and owners will be charged 

impact fees to pay for costs of the county more

 generally, including on other sides of the

 county.  You're -- you say the Takings Clause 

has nothing to say about that. 

What constitutional limits, if any, 

are there, and how would you phrase the exact 

test? 

MS. ROSS: Sure.  So I think the --

the Takings Clause, as some of Justice Jackson's 

questions went to earlier, doesn't really speak 

to this because, again, it's not talking about 

things that the government can't do.  It's 

talking about things the government has to pay 

for when it does do. And so I don't think it's 

necessarily imposing a substantive limit. 

But I think other -- certainly, state 

law has filled a lot of this area. Indeed, and 

Dolan sort of drew its test from state law 

standards that have been well established for 

decades and I think have only gotten sort of

more onerous since then.

 But -- but federal constitutional

 provisions, I think there are due process 

checks. As I mentioned to the Chief Justice, 

there would be equal protection checks as well.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And what -- what

 would be the phrasing of the due process check?

 MS. ROSS: So I think the way that 

this Court has described it is essentially a --

a reasonableness or an arbitrariness test.  I 

acknowledge that courts have given the -- the 

government significant discretion in this area 

and the legislature significant discretion in 

this area, but I think that is often true when 

we're talking, again, about generally applicable 

legislation that isn't impeding on -- or isn't 

taking a private property interest itself.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was up late

 last night.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief

 Justice.  Just a few points.

 The other interesting thing about the 

court of appeal's decision is that it doesn't 

treat this exaction as a tax or a user fee or 

anything else other than a mitigation 

requirement. 

So this case comes to the Court on the 

premise this -- that this is a mitigation 

requirement and that the only reason the court 

of appeal thought that Nollan and Dolan don't 

apply is because of its legislative character. 

In other words, the courts in 

California agree with us that at least in some 

cases, ad hoc impact fees, those are subject to 

Nollan and Dolan, which I think is an 

interesting concession from the California

-- equal protection, yes, those clauses could be 

available in a challenge like this, but the 

problem, of course, is that they provide very 

little protection to the property owner.

 Substantive due process, as I understand the 

cases, would require a showing of arbitrary and

 capricious on the part of the property owner

 challenging it.  Equal protection would require

 rational basis. 

It's Nollan and Dolan that provides --

that provide the kind of robust protections for 

property owners that -- that this context 

requires. 

On administrability, we are not -- we 

are not asking for parcel-specific analyses or 

project-specific analyses. As such, it is true, 

as we state in our reply brief, that a 

project-specific analysis is the way to go if 

the government wants to guarantee for itself 

that its mitigation will pass constitutional 

muster, that the constitutional outcome required 

by Nollan and Dolan, nexus and rough 

proportionality are met.  The only way to do 

that is on a project-specific basis. 

Now the county here decided to impose

its impact fee without any kind of 

administrative proceeding or hearing or anything

 like that.  And we're not challenging that 

aspect, but it's curious, because, in Nollan and 

Dolan, you did have an administrative process

 attached to a conditional permit.  And so,

 there, the government was able to make that 

individualized determination that its 

legislative mandate was or was not tailored to 

the particular impacts of the project. 

Finally, everyone loves good roads and 

schools and public infrastructure, so the 

government certainly has many tools at its 

disposal, including taxes, to pay for those. 

What we're saying is that the 

government can't select a few. The one or two 

or -- or -- or a few property owners who happen 

to need a permit at any given time, to select 

them to bear the burdens of paying for that 

public infrastructure, and all Nollan and Dolan 

do is ensure that that's not happening, that 

what the government is doing is mitigation and 

nothing more. 

Thank you, Your Honor.
