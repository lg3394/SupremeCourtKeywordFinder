 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 23-50, Chiaverini versus 

the City of Napoleon.

 Ms. Anand.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EASHA ANAND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. ANAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Everyone in this case now agrees that 

as the lack of probable cause element of a 

malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth 

Amendment, the charge-specific rule governs. 

That is, a plaintiff may make out a malicious 

prosecution claim by proving that one charge is 

not supported by probable cause, even if other 

charges are, provided, of course, that the 

plaintiff also makes out the other elements of 

the claim. 

As no one appears to dispute, that 

charge-specific rule is supported, as Chief 

Judge Pryor put the point, by both centuries of 

common law and by bedrock Fourth Amendment 

principles.  That's all this Court needs to

address to resolve this case.

 Respondents urge this Court to go 

beyond that ruling to weigh in on a series of 

open questions about a different element of the

 Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim,

 the resulted in a seizure element.

 No one disputes Mr. Chiaverini is

 going to have to prove that on remand.  But 

weighing in on the kind of precise contours of 

that question would require this Court to go 

beyond the question presented to address issues 

not aired at all below, that haven't percolated 

in the courts of appeal, and to do so on the 

sort of briefing that doesn't have the kinds of 

text, history, common law arguments that you'd 

expect before weighing in on an element of a 

constitutional tort. 

As in Thompson, this case involves a 

narrow dispute over one element of a Fourth 

Amendment malicious prosecution claim.  This 

Court should simply hold that a plaintiff can 

make out a claim by showing that at least one 

charge lacks probable cause, again, assuming 

they can make out the other elements of the 

claim, and remand for consideration of

 everything else. 

I welcome this Court's questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do 

you have to show, if anything, about causation? 

If you have a situation where you've got three 

crime -- three allegations and two are 

concededly valid and they justify the seizure,

 you still get relief?  Don't you have to show

 some kind of causation? 

MS. ANAND: Yes, Your Honor.  So we 

agree there has to be some kind of causation. 

We think the formulation in Thompson is correct. 

You have to show that the malicious prosecution 

resulted in a seizure. 

Our position is that if you want to 

weigh in on precisely what the counterfactual 

is, the Eleventh Circuit's position is correct, 

that the correct counterfactual is, could this 

have been done as a warrantless arrest?  The 

Eleventh Circuit said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's "it"? 

MS. ANAND: Could the plaintiff have 

been seized for this length of time or -- or 

seized with this length of time based on a 

warrantless arrest.  So the way -- the way the

Eleventh Circuit articulates it is, look, this 

legal process was corrupted, we know this legal 

process was necessary if the detention is longer 

than 48 hours, right, that's a Fourth Amendment 

requirement, you've got to have legal process

 for a detention that's longer than 48 hours, and 

so, because this legal process was necessary, 

what you have to show is you prevail unless this

 could have been done as a warrantless arrest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I 

thought the -- the evidence was that the -- the 

first two of the crimes would certainly support 

what was done in this case without regard to the 

third. 

MS. ANAND: So that's correct, Your 

Honor. Would support in the sense that a 

magistrate could constitutionally have signed 

this arrest warrant.  But, in fact, no 

magistrate did sign this arrest warrant based on 

just those two charges. 

So, based on this kind of courts' case 

law, so, for instance, we cite the Eastern 

District of Michigan case in our opening brief, 

where the court says -- that's the case, 

remember, where the attorney general says, I can

sign warrants to authorize wiretaps.  This Court 

says surely, a magistrate would have signed off 

on these warrants, right? Surely, a magistrate 

would have caved to the national security

 concerns and signed these things.  Still a 

Fourth Amendment violation because a magistrate

 didn't do so.

 Again, I think this is all beyond the

 scope of the question presented. And, frankly, 

because there are indications from precedent and 

common law to support the Eleventh Circuit's 

rule, at the very least, this Court shouldn't go 

any further than it did in Thompson in defining 

the kind of precise contours of the resulted in 

a seizure element. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you giving up 

on the SG's position that -- as an alternative 

to the Eleventh Circuit's view, that if you can 

show that you were retained for longer or that, 

as you argued below, I understand, at least in 

one of your arguments, that you would have never 

been arrested, you would have been given a 

summons to appear, as the person who sold you 

the jewelry was, so you would have never been in 

jail, that that would be enough? Are you giving

up on that as?

 MS. ANAND: No, Your Honor.  So we

 think -- we don't have much of a dog in this

 fight. We think that we win under the Eleventh

 Circuit's rule, we win under the SG's rule. As

 between the two, we think the Eleventh Circuit's 

rule is more consistent with this Court's

 precedent and with the common law.

 But, again, we think that you should 

make that decision on the basis of some briefing 

about the text of the Fourth Amendment, 

Founding-era practice, common law, none of which 

you have before you. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We shouldn't reach 

it, is what you're saying? 

MS. ANAND: Yes, that's right. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if I think 

it is subsumed within the question presented? 

What is wrong with the logic of the Solicitor 

General's position? 

Under Thompson, an element of the 

claim at issue is a seizure, and that's 

necessary to bring this within the Fourth 

Amendment.  So your client was seized when he 

was arrested, and under Thompson, he experienced

 was in jail.

 And so the question is whether either 

his arrest or the length of his detention was

 the result of the charge -- the so-called

 "money-laundering" charge -- this -- I don't

 know why this statute is called "money 

laundering" because it doesn't seem to have

 anything to do with money laundering.  But 

what's wrong with that logic?  It seems to 

follow step by step. 

MS. ANAND:  So, again, Your Honor, I 

think we win under that test, right?  So the --

the police officer's affidavit in this case says 

we are seeking a warrant because there is a 

felony of the third degree.  So I don't want to 

push too hard on this. You know, I -- I think 

that that -- that's a totally acceptable result 

from our point of view. 

The reason that we think that it's not 

-- that it's not the best way to interpret that 

"resulted in a seizure" language is twofold. 

The first is what Williams explains is that the 

entire point of requiring a neutral and detached 

magistrate to weigh in is to give that neutral

 enforcement interests against the privacy

 interests.

 And so doing this sort of

 counterfactual predicting what the magistrate 

would have done kind of undermines that goal. 

And so I think the Williams rule, which

 basically says, look, if you could have done

 this as a warrantless arrest, right, if you 

didn't need the warrant, you didn't need to have 

a Gerstein hearing, you -- you know, and you 

only detained him for a few hours, then it's 

fine if the warrant process was totally corrupt. 

That was just something bonus you were doing. 

But where the warrant was necessary to 

the detention, you could not have detained him 

for four days without a warrant, then we're not 

going to kind of peer in and try to figure out 

would the magistrate have reached this exact 

same result if it knew the actual charges 

against.

other charges on which there were -- there was 

probable cause were also felonies and maybe even 

more serious felonies than the so-called

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, why? What if

probable cause to support the murder charge and 

then they throw in this money-laundering charge? 

Or let's -- let's say it's an assault, and let's 

say there's a video when the -- the -- the 

legitimate owners of the ring came to the store 

and they were causing a fuss and your client 

pulled out a gun and he -- he said, "get out of 

my store, I'm going to blow your head off."  So

 MS. ANAND: So just as a preface, I

 think that this is the reason you should let

 these rules percolate, right?  We should make --

we should figure out how these rules actually 

play out in practice.

 The reason I think it's the same

 result, what -- what the Williams Court would 

say, is there's a reason police officers lied 

about this charge, right, and so we're going to 

assume that they lied about it in part because 

they needed it to be able to detain the person. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that -- I mean, 

you may be -- this is -- the -- the facts of 

this case are -- are disturbing and you may well 

win. But we're talking about what the general 

rule should be. 

So your rule would apply in a case 

where the police officers act in good faith, but 

they just don't have probable cause?  It's not 

limited to a case in which there was perjury or 

the false -- or the -- the manufacture of false 

evidence, right?  Your rule is not limited in 

that way? 

MS. ANAND: So that's correct, but we

 think another element, right, the mens rea 

element, which this Court hasn't weighed in on 

yet and on which there's a circuit split, is the 

proper element to do the filtering that Your

 Honor's talking about.

 And the reason why I think the more 

serious/less serious charge rule -- so, to be 

clear, I think that's a rule we could certainly

 live with.  We win under that rule.  There's 

some evidence in the common law, the Newell 

Treatise, for instance, seems to suggest that 

the charge lacking probable cause should be the 

more serious charge, so we think there's some 

warrant for it, but the reason we don't think 

it's the best option is because you can imagine 

a situation, for instance, where the felony 

charge is a white-collar offense on which, you 

know, no one's ever going to be detained.  The 

misdemeanor is a resisting arrest charge that --

and the -- the magistrate says, you know, that 

indicates some kind of dangerousness, that's the 

reason I'm going to detain him. 

And so I don't think you can have a 

kind of categorical more serious/less serious 

charge rule.  And, again, I think what the

at the point where this legal process has been 

tainted, remember, this Court's cases like 

Gerstein and County of Riverside say, if there 

was no legal process, right, if there's no 

arrest or Gerstein hearing, we actually don't

 care if there's all the probable cause in the

 world. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you're talking 

about being tainted.  Now you're -- then -- then 

you're back to the idea that Officer Everhard --

Evanoff lied, right?  But what if he hadn't?  I 

mean, what if there's just a -- you know, 

there's no indication that there was a -- that 

there's a lie, there just wasn't probable cause. 

MS. ANAND: Sure, Your Honor.  So I 

think, in that circumstance, first, probable 

cause, remember, is a low bar, right?  It's just 

a reasonable belief. 

And, second, qualified immunity will 

almost certainly protect the officer in a 

situation where there's no probable cause, but 

even the judge is confused and thinks there's 

probable cause.

which he was being detained and for which 

probable cause had been manufactured was the 

tainted crime, and the -- the other crime for 

which there would have been probable cause if a 

warrant had been pursued was the one that had 

not had the adequate process.

 It was just the money laundering.

 And so you actually had that process 

observed for the two misdemeanors in a way that 

Williams, it was kind of like, it was blank,

 right, on -- on the other side, and so there was 

no valid process holding him. Does that -- why

 does that not matter?  I -- I gather you think

 it doesn't. 

MS. ANAND: So I don't think it does 

because Williams is very clear. This is at 1165 

that "Williams will prevail if he establishes a 

genuine dispute about whether at least one of 

the two charges against him for attempted 

murder," right, so, remember, there's attempted 

murder as to two different officers. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mm-hmm. 

MS. ANAND: The holding is he only has 

to prove that one of those lack probable cause. 

This is at 1165. 

So it's true that in Williams, there 

was also this uncharged offense --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mm-hmm. 

MS. ANAND: -- but Williams just says 

you have to prove one of the two charges in the

actual arrest warrant was bogus.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And then I --

I want to understand a distinction or -- or that 

I think is a distinction between your position

 and, say, the SG's.

 Do you agree that a seizure -- that 

you have to show a seizure for purposes of

 making out your claim?

 MS. ANAND: So we -- we agree that you 

could just continue to reiterate the Thompson 

language, which is "resulted in a seizure." We 

don't think this Court should use this case to 

go further and say that there cannot be a 

malicious prosecution claim predicated on, for 

instance, the unreasonable search clause or the 

warrant clause.  We don't have a -- we don't 

think that this is the case that tees that up. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, the search 

clause, sure, but, I mean, is it going farther? 

We've said that before.  I mean, you have to 

make out a Fourth Amendment claim.  And, here, 

your claim is for seizure of the person, and 

it's -- you didn't make, I don't think, a 

separate claim about the seizure of his effects 

being unreasonable?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're fighting

 All we're saying is don't double-count

 the unreasonable.  You don't have to prove 

something separate from the mens rea plus lack

 of probable cause.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  And I -- I'm

 trying to understand why the Sixth Circuit was 

wrong, and I think I have a theory, and I'm 

hoping you can help me to determine whether or

 not I'm right about this.

 MS. ANAND: Sure.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I'm wondering 

whether the Sixth Circuit -- whether they were 

just taking what is a basic principle related to 

probable cause in another context, the other 

kind of Fourth Amendment claim that one might 

bring is the unlawful seizure, false arrest, et 

cetera. 

There, you have no probable cause. 

And we would say that if there are three or four 

different charges being brought and your claim 

was unlawful arrest, when you proved lack of 

probable cause with respect to only one of those 

three or four charges, we would say:  Too bad, 

you still lose, right?  So it's sort of like the 

same idea that the Sixth Circuit was latching 

onto because it -- there are cases that say 

that, but it seems like they're in a different 

context.  They're not malicious prosecution

 theory.  It's the unlawful arrest theory.

 So it's like probable cause is doing

 different work depending upon the theory.  Am I 

-- does that make any sense?

 MS. ANAND: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MS. ANAND: So that's exactly how the

 Sixth Circuit justified this rule.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. 

MS. ANAND:  It said the same rules 

apply to false arrest and malicious prosecution. 

But both at common law and in this Court's 

Fourth Amendment cases, there has always been a 

distinction between the warrantless arrest 

context, where, as Your Honor notes, doesn't 

matter if the officer had one charge or 10 

charge or zero charges in mind, what matters is 

if there's probable cause out there somewhere, 

and the legal process cases, like Gerstein and 

Franks and County of Riverside, where you're 

required to specify the charges, and that's for 

a couple of good reasons that I'm happy to -- to 

explain. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And, I mean, is one 

of them because the malicious prosecution

context is really about the culpability of the

 process server?  It's about the person who is

 initiating process maliciously?

 It's not really about whether you were 

committing bad behavior, whether you were -- so,

 in other words, you could have a person who 

actually is a criminal, right, he's committing

 crimes, but, here -- for Charges 2, 3, and 4, 

but if Charge 1, there was no basis for it, 

baseless, and maliciously added on to the thing, 

that person would still -- added on to the 

indictment, that person would still have at 

least theoretically a claim for malicious 

prosecution with respect to that charge? 

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right.  And 

that's reflected, again, in this Court's Fourth 

Amendment cases.  So, to take an extreme 

example, Gerstein says that if you don't have 

process, right, no warrant, no hearing.  It 

doesn't matter if you're actually guilty of 

absolutely everything.  It's still a Fourth 

Amendment violation because we care about the 

process.

seizure of any duration reasonable is that

someone neutral and detached weighed in and

 signed off on this.  It's not just the police

 officer's discretion.

 And what the any-crime rule would do

 would basically move this back into police 

officers' discretion if they could just lie to 

the magistrate about the set of charges they

 have on --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what are we 

disputing here?  Both sides agree that the Sixth 

Circuit got it wrong.  I guess I'm trying to 

understand why we're continuing on. 

MS. ANAND: I -- I don't think --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Like, what is --

what is left of this case if the fundamental 

issue has been essentially resolved?  There's no 

one -- should we have appointed someone on the 

other side of the question that was presented 

here? 

MS. ANAND: So I don't think so 

because, you know, I -- I do think Respondents 

are arguing for an affirmance on a sort of 

waiver plus this other element theory.  I think 

that this just means it's an easy opinion to 

write. So just last week, in Sheetz, this Court

said, when there's radical agreement that the

 court below erred in applying a categorical 

premise, we leave all the kind of additional

 nuanced arguments for remand.  I think this 

Court should follow the same course here.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, radical

 agreement is -- is a good thing if -- if it 

exists, but I'm not quite sure there was --

there is radical agreement here. I thought the 

argument on the other side, which is presented 

in Respondents' brief and also in one of the 

amicus briefs, which I -- I don't have with me, 

is that the Sixth Circuit had a prior decision 

in which they essentially adopted the Solicitor 

General's position, and what they did here 

should be understood in light of that. 

Isn't that -- isn't that the argument 

on the other side? 

MS. ANAND: So I think the other side 

is making two arguments.  One is the one that 

Your Honor articulated, which is that somehow 

the lower court secretly was applying a 

different rule.  But, as the United States says 

at page 23, that description conflicts with the 

language of the decision below.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, okay, so there's

 a dispute about whether they -- what they did

 here, whether they were following -- I've

 forgotten the name of the earlier Sixth Circuit

 decision.

 MS. ANAND: Howse.  Yeah.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Whether they 

were following that or not. So there's not 

really radical agreement as much as one might 

like to have it. 

MS. ANAND: So I think that there is 

disagreement at about how the "caused a 

seizure," "resulted in a seizure" element works 

in the nuances, right?  What counterfactual you 

run, how exactly -- whether it's the legal 

process could or the bogus charge would have or 

the bogus charge could have. 

But that's a separate element from 

lack of probable cause.  And I think everyone 

agrees that the decision below, which said, 

because probable cause existed on at least one 

charge, his malicious prosecution claim failed, 

full stop, right?  That's the holding of the 

decision below.  Everyone agrees that's not 

correct.  That's not the rule.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And just to clarify

 on the -- the caused the seizure point, your

 position -- say we don't reach it -- on remand

 would be it doesn't matter if it actually caused 

the seizure, it doesn't matter if these 

misdemeanor offenses would have led to the same

 amount of the three days in detention?  That

 would be your position, right?

 MS. ANAND: So I'd articulate it 

slightly differently. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MS. ANAND: I would say that the --

the tainted legal process surely caused the 

seizure.  So, in other words, he could not have 

been held for four days but for this arrest 

warrant or some other form of process. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And why?  Wouldn't 

-- would -- would three or -- what was it, three 

days or four days? 

MS. ANAND: Four days. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Four days.  Okay. 

So would four days be an unreasonable length of 

time for a detention for the two misdemeanors? 

MS. ANAND: It's not that it would be 

an unreasonable length of time.  It's that

Gerstein and County of Riverside say that length 

of detention must be authorized by a neutral and

 detached magistrate.  And, here, a neutral and

 detached magistrate didn't say you can detain 

him or even arrest him for this length of time

 except for -- you know, without knowing that the

 felony charge was bogus.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So you mean, just to 

make sure that I understand, it -- it -- it's 

possible that he could have been held for the 

four days if the magistrate had only had in 

front of him the two misdemeanors, but you're 

saying that the presence of the third 

necessarily corrupts everything else and so the 

causation element doesn't run there? 

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right. 

And, again, the only published circuit court 

case analyzing this question came to that 

result.  So, you know, I think, again, this 

Court should weigh in on that question with the 

benefit of kind of full briefing, argument, some 

sort of historical analysis, and we just don't 

think that's presented here.

MS. ANAND: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- that it doesn't

 matter what actually happened.  What mattered

 was the process was tainted.

 MS. ANAND: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The problem I have

 is that we've thrown malicious prosecution into 

the Fourth Amendment context. And a seizure's 

got to come around someplace in the Fourth 

Amendment because that's what it says, right? 

And that's where I struggle on how to 

put those two things together because, to me, a 

malicious prosecution claim naturally flows from 

the Due Process Clause, and it wouldn't require 

you to show anything other than the process was 

tainted.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.

 MS. ANAND: -- this Court's cases, I 

do think that Gerstein and County of Riverside 

say, as a matter of the Fourth Amendment,

you can make a warrantless arrest, but you've 

got to bring the person in front of a magistrate 

as soon as possible, certainly no longer than 48 

hours. 

And Gerstein doesn't say:  And it's 

okay if you actually did the crime, no need to 

bring them before the magistrate.  It wants the

 MS. ANAND: Well, Your Honor, again, 

setting aside this Court's recent cases saying

 we're entitled to do that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I -- I'm

 not questioning them.  I'm not questioning them.

 MS. ANAND: Sure.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm -- I'm just

 asking purely strategically.  I -- I -- I --

I've struggled to understand why some of these 

cases wind up in federal court when, as an old 

plaintiffs' lawyer, I might have wanted to bring 

them in front of a state court. 

MS. ANAND: To keep them in state 

court? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

MS. ANAND: So there's a couple of 

reasons just speaking at a high level of 

generality.  So many states don't allow 

malicious prosecution against law enforcement, 

so, like, California doesn't allow that. 

In many states, there's a high --

there's a heightened mens rea.  So, in the Sixth 

Circuit, the mens rea for the federal malicious 

prosecution tort is lower than for the state

 little bit about that? What -- what is that

 split?

 MS. ANAND: The -- the -- I can tell

 you that -- the precise split, which is that the 

Fourth, Sixth, and D.C. Circuits say that the 

mens rea element is purely objective.  Other 

circuits have imposed some sort of malice or 

heightened requirement.

rea, okay.  Okay.  Got it.  All right.  And did 

you have anything else you wanted to add? I'm

that the Court should say simply that it is 

possible to bring a Fourth Amendment malicious 

prosecution claim even when a valid charge is 

accompanied by a baseless charge and to stop

 there.

 We think it's important for the Court 

to take one step further and to say that the

 plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the

 baseless charge caused an unreasonable seizure. 

That's an important step to take 

because, if there's no unreasonable seizure, 

there's no violation of the Fourth Amendment. 

But it's also not a significant step to take 

because you'd just be reaffirming what you've 

already said in Thompson. 

Now I understand Respondents to ask 

the Court to take one step further still and to 

determine that the seizure in this particular 

case was reasonable.  But we don't think the 

Court should reach that question because it 

hasn't been the focus of the briefing and wasn't 

passed on below. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

there was probable cause and the police officer 

wants to defend manufacturing the crime that was 

charged on the ground that there was also this 

uncharged crime. 

We don't think the Eleventh Circuit 

rationale makes sense in the context where there 

are multiple charges on which the magistrate did 

pass and it turns out there was no probable

needs to get into that issue in order to resolve

 this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In this case, there is 

evidence from which one could infer that the

 magistrate would not have issued an arrest 

warrant were it not for the felony charge as to

 which there was not probable cause.

 But it does strike me that in many 

other cases, there -- it will be very difficult 

-- and I don't know how a plaintiff would prove 

that the -- the charge that -- for which there 

was no probable cause was the one that resulted 

in the decision to arrest as opposed to just 

issue a cite -- a summons. 

MR. SURI: Justice Alito, I appreciate 

that it may be difficult for the plaintiff to 

make that showing, and since it's an element of 

the claim, the failure to make the showing would 

mean that the plaintiff would lose. 

But I could point out a few ways in 

which a plaintiff might be able to make that 

showing. 

First, if there's a bail determination 

and the -- and the judge sets higher bail

because of a felony charge that was added to a 

misdemeanor charge, but it turns out that the 

felony charge was fabricated, that might be a 

circumstance where it's possible to show that

 the felony charge was the cause of the

 detention.

 In addition, state law might provide 

that certain minor offenses result only in a 

citation or a summons, but more serious offenses 

can result in pretrial detention.  That's 

another way in which the plaintiff could make 

that showing. 

Ultimately, however, it would depend 

on the facts and circumstances of the case. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Presumably, the -- the 

plaintiff would not be able to depose the 

magistrate and ask the magistrate what would you 

have done? 

MR. SURI: That's right, Justice 

Alito. We see this kind of inquiry in other 

areas of criminal procedure.  For example, in an 

ineffective assistance of counsel claim, you ask 

what would the court have done but for counsel's 

error, or in a Brady claim, what would the jury 

have done but for the suppression of particular

 what would have happened in those circumstances.

 We envision a similar inquiry here.

 I -- I -- to make sure that I understand your

 response to Justice Alito, because I was trying

 to figure out from your brief exactly what your 

position was and if it was distinct from 

Respondents'. 

You see it as kind of a but-for

asking would it have been reasonable to detain 

him, say, for four days based on these two 

misdemeanors.  You think the right inquiry is to 

say would he, in fact, have said four days is 

sufficient? 

MR. SURI: Would the magistrate, in 

fact, have authorized the additional detention. 

And the bail example might make that 

particularly clear, what the distinction between 

us and Respondents would be.

the defendant can't pay because of the felony 

charge, that should be enough to show that 

that's an unreasonable seizure if the felony was

 a fabricated charge.

 But I take Respondents to be saying

 that if the magistrate could have simply denied

 bail outright as a matter of federal 

constitutional law, then there's no Fourth

 Amendment violation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just to make sure 

I have this right, you do not think that we

MR. SURI: It's not been the focus of

decided. 

In addition, the unreasonable seizure 

question raised -- raises a variety of nuanced 

issues:  for example, distinguishing between a

magistrate and a fabricated charge for which 

there was probable cause that wasn't presented 

to the magistrate, distinguishing between the

 other procedures that might happen during the

 pretrial procedure.  It's just too complicated 

to get into without briefing.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And as to the two

 questions that you think we -- we should

 address, the one that Ms. Anand agrees with and 

then you added that, of course, this would have 

to cause a seizure, but there's no disagreement 

on that one either, is there? 

MR. SURI: I take Petitioner to be 

suggesting that it's also possible to bring a 

Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim 

under the warrant clause based on the issuance 

of a warrant that's never executed and when no 

seizure was --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I see. I -- I took 

her to say something like we -- we should just 

leave that to the side.  And you think we 

shouldn't leave that to the side? 

MR. SURI: I think that the Court 

should say that to bring this particular type of 

claim, the Manuel, Thompson, Fourth Amendment 

malicious prosecution claim, an unreasonable 

seizure is required.  That's in Thompson itself.

Of course, there may be a separate

 claim under the warrant clause that's cognizable

 under 1983, but that may have a different common

 law analogue.  It may be that the common law 

analogue for that isn't malicious prosecution. 

There's a separate tort that I found preparing 

for this case called malicious procurement of a

 warrant.  Maybe that's the appropriate analogue.

 That's why we suggested you limit your 

focus to the seizure provision. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But you're ask --

you're saying that we should not, just to 

piggyback on Justice Kagan's last point, that 

you would have us stop at just saying that for 

this kind of claim, you have to have caused --

the baseless charge has to have caused an 

unreasonable seizure but not get into how one 

would go about proving that? 

MR. SURI: That's correct.  That would 

be enough to resolve the circuit split. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I took Ms. Anand to be 

agreeing with all of that.  So maybe I'll just 

put in a request with Ms. Anand to say on 

rebuttal whether you agree with all of that.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MEGAN M. WOLD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. WOLD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 it please the Court:

 When a plaintiff brings a Section 1983 

malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth 

Amendment, the plaintiff must show that the 

alleged malicious prosecution resulted in the 

plaintiff's seizure, as this Court held in 

Thompson. 

The Sixth Circuit correctly concluded 

that Petitioner cannot make that showing because 

probable cause supported his detention. 

Petitioner was arrested and detained for three 

days pursuant to a warrant supported by probable 

cause for two first degree misdemeanor crimes, 

each carrying a sentence up to six months' 

imprisonment. 

In light of that, the presence of a 

third charge, allegedly lacking probable cause, 

could not have resulted in Petitioner's

 detention.  This result flows directly from

 existing Fourth Amendment precedents, including 

Devenpeck versus Alford and Whren versus United 

States, which make clear that a seizure does not 

violate the Fourth Amendment "as long as [the]

 circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that

 action."

 Or, as those precedents also state, 

Fourth Amendment reasonableness "allows certain 

actions to be taken in certain circumstances, 

whatever the subjective intent" an arresting 

officer is alleged to have had. 

Moreover, in Baker versus McCollan, 

the Court concluded that a three-day seizure 

like Petitioner's did not violate the Fourth 

Amendment because the arrest and detention was 

pursuant to a warrant supported by probable 

cause, even though police in that case had 

actually detained an innocent individual based 

on a mistaken identification. 

Applying the correct Fourth Amendment 

rule here means setting aside the charge that 

Petitioner alleges to have lacked probable cause

 decision below.

 And I welcome your questions. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happened

 to this -- radical agreement we heard of?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. WOLD: It was news to me that

 there was radical agreement.  I think what has 

happened is that Petitioner has created this 

any-crime rule that was, in fact, a rule that 

the Sixth Circuit had not adopted.  Under this 

any-crime strawman rule, it would mean that the 

presence of one charge supported by probable 

cause automatically justifies any detention.  I 

don't think that's what the Sixth Circuit 

thought.  That's not what the relevant Sixth 

Circuit precedent had held that the panel below 

was applying. 

And I would point the Court to the 

decision below at Cert Appendix pages 9a and 

10a, where the court articulates in a paragraph 

the standard that it's applying for malicious 

prosecution, and it says that the success of the 

malicious prosecution claim depends on whether 

probable cause supported his detention.

And so we need to know what the

 Petitioner's detention was.  And, here, it was 

this few days' detention pursuant to a warrant

 supported by probable cause on two charges.  And

 that satisfies Fourth Amendment reasonableness. 

So there can be no Fourth Amendment malicious

 prosecution claim.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do I do with 

the language of the court that says, moreover, 

we can affirm the district court's decision if 

probable cause supports one or more of the three 

charges? 

MS. WOLD: I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a --

probable -- that's an every crime exception. 

MS. WOLD: I realize that.  I would 

again point the Court to the paragraph that I 

referenced because that's where they articulate 

the standard.  And if there's anything that 

might be somewhat unsatisfactory about the lower 

court opinion, it's that they are joining 

together the false arrest, false imprisonment, 

and malicious prosecution analyses, and I think 

that may cause some shorthand to appear later in 

the opinion that gives that impression.

 could be made -- that absent the felony charge, 

no arrest warrant would have issued?

           MS. WOLD: Oh -- oh, no.  I absolutely 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That a summons 

would have issued?  Do you think then that it's 

an unreasonable seizure to have gotten the 

warrant? 

MS. WOLD: No, I disagree.  And -- and 

that's not the way Fourth Amendment precedents 

operate in this area.  We look at the detention 

and we ask whether it is objectively justified. 

I would point out as well that even on the face 

of the warrant --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what makes -- a 

-- a seizure can be permitted but the detention 

unreasonable. 

MS. WOLD: Absolutely. And I think 

that might arise in circumstances where a -- a 

particular offense is maybe a fine-only offense,

for example, and that's the only charge that --

that can provide probable cause. A more serious 

charge that accompanied it lacks probable cause, 

well, certainly, at some point, the detention,

 and, certainly, beyond 48 hours for an uncharged 

crime, is always going to be unreasonable under

 the Fourth Amendment.  I did --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just -- just to get 

back to the question that Justice Sotomayor 

asked about, that language, I understand that 

you're saying we shouldn't take that language at 

face value, but if that language were taken at 

face value to -- to mean what Justice Sotomayor 

suggested it meant, which is that any crime gets 

you out of -- you do disagree with that? 

MS. WOLD: I -- you're talking about 

the language in the Sixth Circuit opinion.  If 

it meant an any-crime rule the way Petitioner 

defines it, that any probable cause 

automatically insulates any detention, yes, we 

agree that would be incorrect.  We don't think 

that's what the Sixth Circuit applied. 

If, however, you look at the Sixth 

Circuit opinion and you disagree and you think

 right rule.  And we, I think, largely agree with 

the United States about what that rule is.

 But we also think you should apply it

 in this case.  There's ample precedent for --

for doing that in Crawford and Employment 

Division versus Smith, Terry versus United 

States, Katz versus United States, and we think

 that would be appropriate to do here. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you would say, 

first, we knock off the any-crime.  Then we say 

that the -- that there has to be a showing of 

causation as to the detention or the seizure. 

But then you want us to go further 

than the Solicitor General by saying what the 

right way to show causation is.  Is that right? 

MS. WOLD: Well, certainly not the 

right way in every case, but I think the way we 

ask you to then apply the rule you would set out 

is according to existing Fourth Amendment 

precedents. 

And even if you weren't willing to go 

ahead and apply the rule in this case, we do

 prosecution claim, they weren't recognizing a

 brand-new body of Fourth Amendment law that was

 going to create standards that are different

 than in other areas.

 We think the applicability of

 reasonability should continue to be as it 

already is in the Fourth Amendment. And to the 

extent that's dissatisfactory, it would be, as 

Justice Gorsuch suggests, potentially possible 

to locate the claim in the Fourteenth Amendment. 

And there may be efforts to do so.  The Court 

has explicitly reserved that possibility. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So how is it that it 

applies here?  Can you -- so what is your 

standard for causation? 

MS. WOLD: So we just think it's the 

application of ordinary Fourth Amendment 

principles.  So you would look at the warrant 

just as you do under Franks and exclude the 

information that is alleged to be false.  It's 

alleged to be the malicious prosecution 

evidence, if you will. And you would look at 

what remains, and you would ask whether there is 

probable cause and whether that supports the

 detention.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I guess, to look

 at ordinary principles, a lot of those ordinary

 principles come up in a different context, so 

it's hard to really say that they should

 translate and drive the analysis here.

 I mean, I had a -- a whole colloquy 

with Ms. Anand about false arrest, probable 

cause, and what we look at and what we care 

about being different than the -- the probable 

cause element.  And I understand we're talking 

about the causation element, but the -- the 

gravamen of a malicious prosecution claim is not 

the same as the gravamen of an unlawful arrest 

claim. 

And so, when you're thinking about 

unreasonableness for the standpoint -- from the 

standpoint of causation, I guess I'm a little 

worried about treating them the same. 

MS. WOLD: So the Fourth Amendment, as 

we know, prohibits unreasonable seizures but not 

unreasonable charges.  And we think that's the 

difference.  And if there's any kind of misfit 

between these things, I think the Court was well 

aware of that in Thompson, understanding that

the common law malicious prosecution --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, but isn't it --

isn't it -- isn't it, in the malicious 

prosecution context, the malicious and 

unreasonable charge has caused, as you say, the 

unlawful seizure. And so, when we're looking at

 causation, it's very hard for me to understand 

how you can take out of the picture, as you --

as you did with your definition, the malicious 

prosecution. 

What Ms. Anand is saying is that when 

you have a malicious initiation of charges, that 

sort of taints the process. And it's very -- it 

-- you know, it's almost like you have to 

presume that almost everything that happened 

afterwards was -- was tainted by that, unless we 

have clear evidence that you could have 

proceeded without the -- the malicious 

prosecution. 

And you seem to be saying the opposite 

in a -- in a way. 

MS. WOLD: I think that those same 

kinds of arguments could have been put forward,

 context of a false arrest.  And the answer was a 

Fourth Amendment answer about reasonableness and

 that Fourth Amendment reasonableness does not 

depend on the subjective intent of a particular

 officer.  We know that from Whren, from

 Devenpeck, from numerous other cases.  It also

 doesn't --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's because 

that's not a malicious prosecution scenario. I 

mean, this is the -- this is the precise point, 

right? When you take the jurisprudence that 

relates to the reasonableness of just an 

unlawful arrest, I totally buy what you're 

saying.  We're not -- because we're not really 

focusing on the intent of the officer, we're 

looking at the circumstances and whether or not 

an objective officer with those circumstances 

would have arrested you and behaved in that way. 

But, when you're beginning in the 

world of malicious prosecution, the thing that 

we care about is the intent and the 

maliciousness and what the process is doing to 

you for baseless reasons. 

And so, once we're -- we're starting 

there, it seems to me you can't really judge the

 causation by those other standards, by standards

 that -- that say, well, we don't really care

 what the officer was thinking.  We're -- we've 

already crossed that bridge because we're in the

 world of malicious prosecution.

 MS. WOLD: I think that Thompson 

answers this question by requiring that there be 

an unreasonable seizure because Thompson was

 locating the claim in the Fourth Amendment or at 

least acknowledging it as a type of Fourth 

Amendment claim that could be brought. 

And I think the kinds of things you're 

discussing might be more at home in the 

Fourteenth Amendment.  But it's not been a part 

of our Fourth Amendment analysis.  And I don't 

think that Thompson was creating a rule by which 

there would be a -- a new type of claim and it 

would have brand-new elements and change the 

meaning of probable cause. 

I think Thompson was acknowledging 

that this claim could be brought under the 

Fourth Amendment, but I don't think there's any 

reason to deviate from Fourth Amendment 

principles --

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- Ms. Wold, if we 

do what the SG proposes that we do and say, you

 know, the any-crime rule is not good, but you do 

have to show causation and that -- and that this 

caused a seizure in order to make out the Fourth

 Amendment claim, what happens on remand?  What

 arguments then do you make?

 MS. WOLD: Well, I think, on remand, 

we would continue to argue, as I would ask the 

Court to also state, that Fourth Amendment --

existing Fourth Amendment principles apply, and 

so the question is whether his detention is 

justified by probable cause. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And so this would be 

the colloquy that you're having with Justice 

Jackson right now saying that we look at it 

objectively and we say:  Was this four days, if 

you cross out, put your hand over the 

money-laundering charge, would it have been 

reasonable to hold him for four days for these 

two misdemeanors? 

MS. WOLD: Yes, that's exactly right. 

So you would ask based on the probable cause 

that we know was determined by a neutral and

warrant, the probable cause in those two charges 

clearly justifies the entirety of his detention, 

and that would resolve the issue.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Does it get tricky? 

I mean, I'm not sure any of our precedent 

squarely addresses this point.

 When do we stop thinking about the

 Fourth Amendment and start thinking about, say, 

speedy trial or is this -- is he being held so 

long that we're violating the Sixth Amendment or 

was this fine so high it's actually, you know, 

an excessive fine problem? 

Is all this really -- and is that 

maybe another reason for caution here?  Is all 

this really a Fourth Amendment issue? 

MS. WOLD: So I think the recognition 

that pretrial detention could be a Fourth 

Amendment claim arises in 2017 with Manuel.  So 

some of these questions may be a bit new. 

I do think, in the past, the Court has 

resolved some questions about length of 

detention by asking at some point did that 

detention become punishment and then it's 

punishment without a conviction. And that can

 Maybe it's an unsatisfactory answer.

 I think there are complicating factors here.  I

 think this case and these facts are not

 difficult because the detention is so limited 

and it clearly corresponds to the length of

 detention the Court has found to be reasonable

 under the Fourth Amendment in other cases, like

 Baker versus McCollan, where, you know, there, 

you had the wrong person.  That person was 

completely innocent and saying so from the 

moment of arrest onward, but the warrant was 

valid. The warrant was supported by probable 

cause, and that justified the detention for a 

matter of days. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you. 

MS. WOLD: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'd just like to 

understand better the -- if -- if we were to 

remand for some sort of causation showing here, 

exactly what your argument would be. 

Would it be that probable cause 

existed sufficient on the two charges that 

remained and that that would be enough to 

justify four days, or would it be that there's

 to that would suffice to support four days?

 MS. WOLD: It -- it would be -- well,

 first, I -- obviously, I don't want to exclude 

on remand that we might make lots of arguments,

 but I think the -- the argument I'm -- I'm 

positing today is that the two charges that were 

the subject of the warrant, those supply

 probable cause, not some kind of uncharged 

conduct, not under any law. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: I guess I'm 

wondering why that would be the case under your 

logic. If we're going to take the Fourth --

we're trying to import Fourth Amendment 

principles further into this malicious 

prosecution claim, a false arrest seems to be 

where you're kind of driving the train and -- or 

wanting to -- I may be mistaken there. 

And -- and, there, I'm not sure we 

would always be limited to the -- the indictment 

or charge.  We would look and see if there's 

probable cause to support the detention vel non. 

MS. WOLD: Right.  I think, in this 

case, it wouldn't be enough to look at uncharged 

conduct because the seizure lasted more than 48

determination by a neutral and detached 

magistrate as to uncharged conduct, and that's 

why you couldn't do what you could otherwise do 

in the false arrest context.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  We're not looking 

necessarily at uncharged conduct, but -- I -- I

 understand that limitation, but the claims that

 the -- that the government might bring.  Why --

why would you be limited on that?

come up with a crime. But there's a lot of 

crimes out there these days, not just those you 

happen to charge.

all after the fact.  And so, here, we know the 

detention went beyond 48 hours.  We are limited

 plaintiff dynamic that I explored with Ms. 

Anand, and maybe you can help me understand why

 that's the case -- why that's not the case.

 So I said we have a person who is a 

criminal and he's committing crimes and he's got

 three or four of them absolutely dead to rights, 

but one of them, no. One of them, he says, this 

additional thing, whatever it is, I didn't do

 it. And because I'm, you know, a career 

criminal, the police officer knows me from way 

back when, and he actually tacked that on after 

he made stuff up and he -- this charge is a 

malicious prosecution. 

It seems to me that if we buy your 

rule of causation, so, first of all, we -- we --

we don't say, you know, any charge, he -- he --

he still gets to go forward just because there 

are these other charges, he still gets to go 

forward on that basis, but you're knocking him 

out basically for the same reason on the 

causation prong.

 And I guess I don't understand why 

that's the case. Why shouldn't he still be able 

to make his claim on the civil docket with 

respect to the malicious prosecution of that one

 charge?

 MS. WOLD: I think you've absolutely

 highlighted the distinction between our

 positions.  I think Williams versus Aguirre, 

which Petitioner embraces, would hold that you 

could make out a per se constitutional violation 

for that alleged malicious prosecution. 

And we think that's incorrect, and we 

think that's because of the operation of the 

Fourth Amendment.  The correct rule is a Fourth 

Amendment rule.  How could you have a per se --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. 

MS. WOLD: -- constitutional violation 

for an unreasonable charge, which the Fourth 

Amendment does not forbid, without an 

unreasonable seizure?  And -- and we think it's 

the Fourth Amendment that does the work there. 

And that's a clear distinction. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what if the other 

crimes are all misdemeanors and he can show --

we have this coming up in other cases -- that no 

one would ever have been prosecuted or held or 

detained for the three other things? Yes, he

 says, I did those things, but those are not 

things for which people get detained. It's the

 one they made up, and that's, in fact, why they 

made it up, because they wanted me to go to

 jail. 

Does he go forward or no under your 

causation prong? 

MS. WOLD: We -- we still think it is 

the overlay of existing Fourth Amendment 

precedent that asks about that objectively, and 

-- and that means that if those misdemeanor 

charges, regardless of local practice, even if 

it hadn't been local practice to arrest for 

those, the Fourth Amendment says you can arrest 

for even a fine-only offense.  That's Atwater 

versus City of Lago Vista. 

And the Fourth Amendment also allows 

an arrest even if it would be unlawful under 

state law. That's Virginia versus Moore.  Those 

don't violate the Fourth Amendment, so you can 

hold that individual. 

Now it would be a different case if

the only probable cause that supports it are for

 these very minor misdemeanor offenses.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But it doesn't

 matter to you at all if -- if there's evidence

 that he puts forward that no one would ever --

that -- that this magistrate, in fact, wouldn't 

have or didn't, you know, go forward with

there in order to get him to go to jail?

that is exactly the kind of analysis that the 

Fourth Amendment forecloses.  And I can point to 

Whren, Virginia versus Moore, that all say the 

Fourth Amendment reasonableness does not depend 

on local practice.  It doesn't depend on state 

law. It doesn't vary from place to place and 

from time to time.  And that's just settled 

Fourth Amendment law.

all the charges against me were false?

 MS. WOLD: I think the standard could

 definitely be different.  Under those, I think, 

under state law, there is no requirement that 

you show a seizure, so the analysis would be

 different.  That claim has been abandoned by

 this stage in the litigation.

 And, yes, under the Fourteenth 

Amendment, you wouldn't have this requirement to 

show a seizure. I think the analysis would be 

different if the Court were to recognize it in 

the future.

So, to answer Justice Kagan's question

 first, we are totally fine with the United 

States' position, answer the question presented, 

reiterate what you said in Thompson, that the

 malicious prosecution must have resulted in a 

seizure, which, as the United States points out, 

is perfectly consistent with our preferred 

Eleventh Circuit formulation, and don't touch 

the question of the warrant clause. 

We raised the warrant clause to talk 

about the values and purposes of the Fourth 

Amendment only, not to suggest that there is 

necessarily a 1983 claim predicated on it or 

what constitutional tort applies. 

As for Respondents' position, I'll 

just note that what they're now describing as a 

strawman is precisely what they argued for 

below. Here's a quote from oral argument:  "So 

long as probable cause exists to one of multiple 

criminal charges, that is enough to negate the 

entire malicious prosecution claim." 

This Court can do a lot of good by 

just resolving the question presented and saying 

that the -- the any-crime rule -- as Justice 

Gorsuch said, you can always come up with some

 crime for which there's probable cause.  And so

 the any-crime rule allows police officers to 

entirely insulate their misconduct by just

 tacking on a -- a charge for which there is

 probably probable cause for just about anyone.

 This Court can do a lot of good by 

just saying that that rule is incorrect, that a

 plaintiff can make out a malicious prosecution 

claim even if some charges are supported by 

probable cause, and we'll fight about all the
