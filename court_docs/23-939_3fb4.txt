 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 23-939, Trump

 versus United States.

 Mr. Sauer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. JOHN SAUER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SAUER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Without presidential immunity from 

criminal prosecution, there can be no presidency 

as we know it. For 234 years of American 

history, no president was ever prosecuted for 

his official acts.  The Framers of our 

Constitution viewed an energetic executive as 

essential to securing liberty. 

If a president can be charged, put on 

trial, and imprisoned for his most controversial 

decisions as soon as he leaves office, that 

looming threat will distort the president's 

decision-making precisely when bold and fearless 

action is most needed.  Every current president 

will face de facto blackmail and extortion by 

his political rivals while he is still in

 office.

 The implications of the Court's 

decision here extend far beyond the facts of

 this case.  Could President George W. Bush have 

been sent to prison for obstructing an official

 proceeding or allegedly lying to Congress to

 induce war in Iraq?  Could President Obama be 

charged with murder for killing U.S. citizens

 abroad by drone strike?  Could President Biden 

someday be charged with unlawfully inducing 

immigrants to enter the country illegally for 

his border policies? 

The answer to all these questions is 

no. Prosecuting the president for his official 

acts is an innovation with no foothold in 

history or tradition and incompatible with our 

constitutional structure.  The original meaning 

of the Executive Vesting Clause, the Framers' 

understanding and intent, an unbroken historical 

tradition spanning 200 years, and policy 

considerations rooted in the separation of 

powers all counsel against it. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Sauer, to -- to 

your last point, could you be more precise as to

the source of this immunity?

 MR. SAUER: The source of the immunity

 is principally rooted in the Executive Vesting

 Clause of Article II, Section 1.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  And how does that

 happen?

 MR. SAUER: That -- that it -- the

 source of it, Justice Thomas, I think is, as you 

described in your separate opinion in 

Zivotofsky, for example, that the Executive 

Vesting Clause does not include only executive 

powers laid out explicitly therein but 

encompasses all the powers that were originally 

understood to be included therein. 

And Marbury against Madison itself 

provides strong evidence of this kind of 

immunity, a broad principle of immunity that 

protects the president's official acts from 

scrutiny, direct -- sitting in judgment, so to 

speak, of the Article III courts, it -- that 

that matches the original understanding of the 

Executive --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So how --

MR. SAUER: -- Vesting Clause. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- how exactly would

we determine what the -- what an official act

 is?

 MR. SAUER: I'd say -- I'd point the

 Court to two cases for that.  Obviously, 

Fitzgerald against Nixon is the best guidance 

that the Court gives where it -- of course, the 

Court adopted the outer perimeter test, and this

 Court engaged in analysis -- analysis there 

that's very instructive here, where it looked at 

the level of specificity at which the acts are 

described, in -- in -- in that case, a civil 

case. Here, it would be the indictment.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if 

you have -- let's say the official act is 

appointing ambassadors, and the president 

appoints a particular individual to a country, 

but it's in exchange for a bribe.  Somebody 

says, I'll give you a million dollars if I'm 

made the ambassador to whatever. 

How do you analyze that? 

MR. SAUER: That, I think, would fall 

under this Court's discussion in Brewster, where 

the Court held with respect to legislative acts 

that bribery is not an official act, which also 

matches the court -- common law background.

So I -- the way that this Court in 

Brewster kind of sliced at the joint was to say 

accepting the bribe and the agreement to accept

 the bribe are not official acts. That's private

 conduct --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's

 not --

MR. SAUER: -- where a subsequent

 appointment would not be -- would be essentially 

an unrestrictable power of this Court that 

Congress couldn't directly regulate. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not --

accepting a bribe isn't an official act, but 

appointing an ambassador is certainly within the 

official responsibilities of the president. 

So how -- how could you -- how -- how 

does your official acts or the official acts 

border, boundary come into play when it's going 

to be official, assuming that the president is 

innocent, but the whole question is whether he's 

going to be found innocent or guilty? 

MR. SAUER: Again, it -- I -- I think 

Brewster and Johnson do address that or very 

persuasively at least in a slightly different 

context.  Brewster and Johnson say the

 what it's for because the what's for part is 

within the president's official duties? 

MR. SAUER: There -- there has to be, 

we would say, an independent source of evidence 

for that.  And keep in mind that this indictment 

charges what this Court has described as 

unrestrictable powers of the president.  So the 

premise, the logical premise, of this indictment 

is that Congress, by passing vague and general 

criminal statutes, has purported to directly 

regulate the president's exercise of things like 

the exercise of the employment and removal 

power, things like his ability to speak directly 

to the American public, core exercises of his 

authority under the Recommendations Clause to 

recommend to Congress, members of Congress, the 

measures he thinks necessary and expedient.

So you have a indictment in this case

 that goes right to the heartland of the 

president's powers, that alleges a whole series 

of official acts and tries to tie them together 

by saying, well, there's a private aim or a

 private purpose in that case.  And that's a 

situation which, of course, could be alleged in

 virtually any indictment.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, it can be 

alleged, but it has to be proven.  Malum in se 

is a concept long viewed as appropriate in law, 

that there are some things that are so 

fundamentally evil that they have to be 

protected against. 

Now I think -- and -- and your answer 

below, I'm going to give you a chance to say if 

you stay by it. If the president decides that 

his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the 

military or orders someone to assassinate him, 

is that within his official acts that -- for 

which he can get immunity? 

MR. SAUER: It would depend on the 

hypothetical.  But we can see that could well be 

an official act. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It could, and why?

 Because he's doing it for personal reasons. 

He's not doing it, at -- like President Obama is 

alleged to have done it, to protect the country

 from a terrorist.  He's doing it for personal

 gain. And isn't that the nature of the 

allegations here, that he's not doing them --

doing these acts in furtherance of an official

 responsibility; he's doing it for personal gain?

 MR. SAUER: I -- I agree with that 

characterization of the indictment.  And that 

confirms immunity because the characterization 

is that there's a series of official acts that 

were done for an unlawful or improper --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, because --

MR. SAUER: -- purpose. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- immunity says, 

even if you did it for personal gain, we won't 

hold you responsible.  What do you -- how could 

that be? 

MR. SAUER: That's an extremely strong 

doctrine in this Court's case law in cases like 

Fitzgerald, the heartland, Johnson and supports 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we go back 

to Justice Thomas's question, which was, where

does that come from?

 There are amici here who tell us that

 the Founders actually talked about whether to 

grant immunity to the president. And, in fact,

 they -- had state constitutions that granted

 some criminal immunity to governors.

 And yet they didn't take it up.

 Instead, they find -- they pass an impeachment 

clause that basically says you can't remove the 

president from -- from office except by a trial 

in the Senate, but you can impeach him after. 

So -- or you can impose criminal liability. 

We would be creating a situation in 

which we would be saying is -- this is what 

you're asking us to say -- which is that a 

president is entitled not to make a mistake but 

more than that.  A president is entitled for 

total personal gain to use the trappings of his 

office -- that's what you're trying to get us to 

hold -- without facing criminal liability. 

MR. SAUER: Your Honor, I -- I would 

say three things in response to that. 

First, the doctrine that immunity does 

not turn on the allegedly improper motivation or 

purpose is something that this Court has

reaffirmed in at least nine or ten cases.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's absolute

 immunity.  But qualified immunity does say that 

whatever act you take has to be within what a

 reasonable person would do.  I'm having a hard 

time thinking that creating false documents,

 that submitting false documents, that ordering 

the assassination of a rival, that accepting a 

bribe, and countless other laws that could be 

broken for personal gain, that anyone would say 

that it would be reasonable for a president or 

any public official to do that. 

MR. SAUER: Your Honor, as this Court 

said very persuasively in Fitzgerald, that the 

allegation that this particular act would be 

done for an unlawful purpose or was unlawful 

could be made in every case, and, therefore, if 

that were the doctrine, that the allegation of 

improper purpose is what deprives the objective 

acts of their immunity, then the immunity would 

have no purchase.  And that's reflected in many 

of the other Court's cases. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't -- isn't the 

work, though, of the improper motive at least in

the absolute immunity context to tell us what 

are official acts and what are not? I mean, I 

had understood that even in the -- first of all, 

your ask is absolute immunity, isn't it?  I

 mean, that's --

MR. SAUER: That's our principal

 position, yes.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- that's your --

your position is you want the same kind of 

doctrine that we've applied in other contexts 

when we say an official has absolute immunity. 

And my understanding is that when we 

say that, we mean for their official acts.  Is 

that right? 

MR. SAUER: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  So any 

official acts.  But then, in that world, the 

real decision-making from the Court's standpoint 

is whether or not something is an official act 

or not, correct? 

MR. SAUER: That is an important 

determination by all means. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I mean, that's the 

determination in the absolute immunity world 

because, if you determine that it's an official

 for it, correct?

 MR. SAUER: That is correct.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So my

 question -- and I think the Chief Justice may 

have asked this at the beginning -- is how do

 you determine what -- or maybe Justice Thomas --

how do you determine what is an official act?

 And when we're talking about the kinds 

of scenarios that Justice Sotomayor brought up, 

one could say that when the president is using 

the trappings of his office to achieve a 

personal gain, then he's actually not acting 

officially, even if the doctrine was absolute 

immunity.  So what do you say about that? 

MR. SAUER: Two things in response to 

that. 

First, to the last point, that 

allegation that this was really motivated by an 

improper private purpose could be made in every 

single case. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand 

that, but -- but -- but it would have to be made 

-- I'm -- I'm just trying to assess.  Even if we 

had the Doctrine of Absolute Immunity, that same

come in because the person would be arguing that 

he was not acting in his official capacity. He 

wasn't doing something official. He was doing

 it personal, correct?

 MR. SAUER: If he -- I agree, the --

the objective -- or I'm not sure I agree, but --

but the point I would make in response to that

 is, in Fitzgerald against Nixon, this Court 

emphasized that that would result in an 

intrusive discussion or determination of the 

president's personal motives for every official 

act. And, again, this is not just in the case 

of the presidency.  It's for virtually every --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Can I 

just ask you another -- another quick question 

before my colleagues take it over here? 

At the beginning of your analysis, 

when you were giving your opening statements, 

you were talking about, you know -- the -- you 

suggested that the lack of immunity and the 

possibility of prosecution in the presidential 

context is like an innovation. 

And I understood it to be the status 

quo. I mean, I -- I understood that every

president from the beginning of time essentially

 has understood that there was a threat of 

prosecution if for no other reason than the --

the Constitution suggests that they can be 

prosecuted after impeachment, that, you know, 

the Office of Legal Counsel has said forever 

that presidents are amenable to a threat of

 prosecution and they have continued to function 

and do their jobs and do all the things that 

presidents do. 

So it seems to me that you are asking 

now for a change in what the law is related to 

immunity. 

MR. SAUER: I would quote from what 

Benjamin Franklin said at the Constitutional 

Convention, which I think reflects best the 

Founders' original understanding and intent 

here, which is, at the Constitutional 

Convention, Benjamin Franklin said:  History 

provides one example only of a chief magistrate 

who is subject to public justice, criminal 

prosecution.  And everybody cried out against 

that as a --

the office, that they were taking this office

 subject to potential criminal prosecution, no?

 MR. SAUER: I don't -- I see the

 opposite.  I see all the evidence going the

 other way. Marbury against Madison, Mississippi

 against Johnson discussed this broad immunity

 principle that naturally extends to the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what -- what was 

up with the pardon -- what was up with the 

pardon for President Nixon? 

MR. SAUER: I think that --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I mean, if everybody 

thought that presidents couldn't be prosecuted, 

then what -- what was that about? 

MR. SAUER: Well, he was under 

investigation for both private and public 

conduct at the time, official acts and private 

conduct. 

And I think everyone has properly 

understood that the president -- since, like, 

President Grant's carriage-riding incident, 

everyone has understood that the president could 

be prosecuted at least for things like private 

conduct.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, on -- on --

on that score, you -- there does seem to be some

 common ground between the -- you and your 

colleague on the other side that no man's above 

the law and that the president can be prosecuted

 after he leaves office for his private conduct.

 Is that right?

 MR. SAUER: We agree with that.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then the 

question becomes, as we've been exploring here 

today a little bit, about how to segregate 

private from official conduct that may or may 

not enjoy some immunity, and we -- I'm sure 

we're going to spend a lot of time exploring 

that. 

But the D.C. Circuit in Blassingame, 

the chief judge there, joined by the panel, 

expressed some views about how to segregate 

private conduct for which no man is above the 

law from official acts. 

Do you have any thoughts about the 

test that they came up with there? 

MR. SAUER: Yes.  We think, in the 

main, that test, especially if it's understood 

through the lens of Judge Katsas' separate

a great source for this Court to rely on in 

drawing this line. And it emphasizes the

 breadth of that test.

 It talks about how actions that are,

 you know, plausibly connected to the president's

 official duties are official acts.  And it also 

emphasizes that if it's a close case or it 

appears there's considerations on the other 

side, that also should be treated as immune. 

Those are the -- the aspects of that 

that we'd emphasize as potentially guiding the 

Court's discretion. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And that left open 

in that case the possibility of further 

proceedings and trial. 

MR. SAUER: Exactly right.  And -- and 

that would be a very natural course for this 

Court to take. In this place, the Court can and 

should reverse the categorical holding of the 

D.C. Circuit that there's no such thing as 

official acts, especially when it comes to --

 Court to Anderson against Creighton, where the 

Court said there would be kind of two stages of

 these further proceedings.  There's looking at

 the indictment itself or, in that case, it was

 a -- you -- you know, a complaint, but look at 

the charging document itself and see whether on 

the face of it this is alleging official acts. 

And if not or it can't be determined, then there 

would be a factual proceeding. 

And all of that under Mitchell against 

Forsyth and so forth would have to occur before 

any other proceedings in the District.

robust form of immunity that you're advocating 

is really necessary in order to achieve that 

result. So just to take one possible 

alternative, suppose the rule were that a former 

president cannot be prosecuted for official acts 

unless no plausible justification could be 

imagined for what the president did, taking into

 account history and legal precedent and the

 information that was provided to the president 

at the time when the act was taken. 

Would that be sufficient?  Or, if it 

is insufficient, why would it be insufficient? 

MR. SAUER: That might be a much 

better rule than what emerged in the lower 

courts here.  We think it would be insufficient 

because, again, that long line of cases talking 

about using the president's motives and the 

intrusive sort of consideration of the 

president's motives as transforming acts to 

official and unofficial would be -- would come 

into play. 

And, of course, once you can make that 

allegation, all of a sudden you've opened the 

door. You no longer have a per se clear 

bright-line rule. You have a -- a determination

that may not be different than what we're 

proposing to the Court today.

correct me if I'm wrong.  He's not --

 objective determination, may well be a -- an 

interesting approach to take in this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So apply it to the

 allegations here.  What is plausible about the

 president insisting in creating a -- a

 fraudulent slate of electoral candidates? 

Assuming you accept the facts of the complaint 

on their face, is that plausible that that would

 be within his right to do? 

MR. SAUER: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

The -- we have the historical precedent we cite 

in the lower courts of President Grant sending 

federal troops to Louisiana and Mississippi in 

1876 to make sure that the Republican electors 

got certified in those two cases, which 

delivered the election to Rutherford B. Hayes. 

The notion that it's completely implausible I 

think just can't be supported based on the face 

of this indictment or even really --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Knowing that the 

slate is fake?  Knowing that the slate is fake, 

that they weren't actually elected, that they 

weren't certified by the state, he knows all 

those things?

 alleges -- I dispute that characterization.  The 

-- the indictment affixes the word -- label to

 the so-called fraudulent electors -- it affixes 

the word "fraudulent." But that's a complete

 mischaracterization.  On the face of the 

indictment, it appears that there was no deceit

 about who had emerged from the relevant state 

conventions, and this was being done as an

 alternative basis. 

But I want to address a more 

higher-level point, a fundamental point, which 

is that, as Justice Alito's question indicated, 

there's a whole series of structural checks 

other than criminal prosecution that are 

designed to deter these kind of, you know, 

outlandish scenarios or extraordinarily 

obviously illegal things, and that's been viewed 

in this Court's opinions going all the way back 

to at least Martin against Mott. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Where -- where do 

you think the D.C. Circuit went wrong in how it 

determined what was official versus what's 

personal?

 adopting a categorical view.  It does not

 matter, is the -- the logic of their -- their

 opinion because there is no immunity for

 official acts and, therefore, you know, that's 

the end of the story.

 I don't really think they went wrong 

in Blassingame in the civil context when they 

engaged in the same determination with respect

 to what's official and what isn't official. 

There, we agree with most of what that opinion 

said. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And for some 

official acts that are not within the Article II 

exclusive power, okay, so official acts but not 

within the Article II exclusive power, even for 

those, I assume you would think that a clear 

statement has to be required, a clear statement 

in the statute covering the president, if the 

president's official acts are going to be 

criminalized? 

MR. SAUER: Absolutely.  Obviously, 

the issue is, you know, at the highest possible 

level when it comes to the unrestrictable powers 

like, as in this indictment, the allegation 

about the performance clause.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, I'm assuming 

the exclusive powers are walled off and can't be

 prosecuted before -- there's a lot of official

 powers that are not exclusive to the president

 under his Article II authority, but for those, I 

understood you to be saying, at a minimum, there 

would need to be a clear statement in the 

statute referencing the president so that the

 president's on notice and can conduct himself or 

herself accordingly. 

MR. SAUER: That's absolutely correct, 

and that would be consistent both with Franklin 

and Public Citizen and cases -- a long series of 

other clear statement rule cases. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I follow up on 

that because I --

private acts don't get immunity?

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Of course. 

MR. SAUER: -- that sounds private to 

me. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sounds private? 

"Petitioner conspired with another 

private attorney who caused the filing in court 

of a 'verification' signed by Petitioner that 

contained false allegations to support a 

challenge."  Private?

MR. SAUER: If you look at the -- if

a bunch of acts that we think are just clearly 

official.  There may be allegations that mostly 

relate to what the government has described here 

as private aim or private end.  And the Court 

should remand or -- or address itself but remand 

for a Brewster-like determination, which is 

what's official and what's private.  The 

official stuff has to be expunged completely 

from the indictment before the case can go 

forward, and there has to be a determination at 

least on remand of what's official -- a 

two-stage determination of what's official and 

what's private.

expunge the official part from the indictment, 

how do you -- I mean, that's like a -- a -- a

 one-legged stool, right? I mean, giving 

somebody money isn't bribery unless you get

 something in exchange, and if what you get in

 exchange is to become the ambassador to a 

particular country, that is official, the

 appointment.  It's within the president's

 prerogatives.  The unofficial part is I'm going 

to get a million dollars for it. 

So, if you say you have to expunge the 

official part, how does that go forward? 

MR. SAUER: In this particular 

indictment, where we say virtually all the overt 

conduct is official, we don't believe it would 

be able to go forward.  I mean, there could be a 

case where it would, but if you look at -- even 

the government's brief in this case divides up 

the indictment into things that, other than the 

electors allegations, don't really -- are --

they haven't disputed that they are official 

acts. But what they do is say, well, we tie it 

all together by characterizing it as done -- and

done so in the Southern District of Florida 

case, and we totally agree with the analysis 

provided by Attorney General Meese and Attorney

 General Mukasey.  And -- and it points to a very

 important issue here because one of their 

arguments is, of course, that, you know, we 

should have this presumption of regularity. 

That runs into the reality that we have here an

 extraordinary prosecutorial power being 

exercised by someone who was never nominated by 

the president or -- or -- or confirmed by the 

Senate at any time. 

So we agree with that position.  We --

we hadn't raised it yet in this case when this 

case went up on appeal. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  When you say that the 

official acts should be expunged from the 

indictment, that in itself would not achieve 

very much unless evidence of those official acts 

were precluded at trial. 

So is that what you're saying, that 

the prosecution should not be permitted at trial 

to prove the official acts as part of the 

conspiracies that are alleged?

 very analogous context.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm a little 

bit confused by that. If you have a scheme to 

defraud or a scheme to accept bribery, there's 

evidence from which you can infer that scheme, 

and one of it is that the appointment actually 

happened.  It's an official act. 

You wouldn't expunge that as evidence. 

You would instruct the jury that there's no 

liability for the actual appointment, that the 

liability is for accepting the bribe. 

Similarly here, I don't think the 

indictment is charging that the obstruction 

occurred solely because of conversations with 

the Justice Department.  They're saying you look 

at all of the private acts and you look in the 

context of some of the public acts and you can 

infer the intent, the private intent, from them. 

So I'm not sure that I understand why

your problems couldn't be taken care of at trial 

with an instruction if we believe -- if the

 Court were to find -- I'm not even sure how they

 could -- but if it were to find that some public 

acts could not be the basis of criminal

 liability.

 MR. SAUER: I -- I think the best

 thing I can say to that is -- and I think this

 ties into the Chief Justice's question about a 

one-legged stool. Brewster and Johnson and 

subsequent cases like Helstoski versus Meanor 

essentially say that, that this is a one-legged 

stool problem. It will be difficult for some of 

these prosecutions to proceed.  And that is the 

implications of official immunity, which is 

dictated in the Constitution here by the 

Executive Vesting Clause. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I continue on 

in -- in Justice Barrett's vein a little bit and 

ask you about some of the allegations of the

not in your view.

 MR. SAUER: Essentially exactly right.

 And neither allegation of what the purpose is

 should make a determination -- should make a

 difference as to whether it's immune.  That is 

extremely strong precedent from this Court.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Does it -- does it 

strike you as odd that your understanding of 

immunity goes way beyond what OLC has ever 

claimed for the -- a former president? 

MR. SAUER: I -- I view the OLC 

opinions here as strongly supporting us because 

anytime a congressional statute basically got 

anywhere near touching the president's 

prerogatives, they've said, oh, we're going to 

interpret the statute narrowly to avoid that. 

So we have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's a 

different question. I mean, what OLC has always 

said is that sitting presidents get immunity, 

but former presidents?  No. 

Now there might be a different 

argument made about whether a statute or whether 

a statute as applied to particular conduct is --

is -- is properly available against the

 president, but that's a very different argument 

than the immunity claim that you're making here,

 which OLC has definitively not supported.

 MR. SAUER: I don't -- I don't know if 

I'd put it that way. I don't recall an opinion 

directly addressing it, but more fundamental to 

us, Your Honor, is, in fact, the language of

 cases like Marbury and statements like made by 

Benjamin Franklin at the Constitutional 

Convention, statements of George Washington 

talking about the massive risk of factional 

strife and how that could destroy the Republic 

and erect a new government on the ruins of 

public liberty. 

That's what we rely on principally 

here. I cite the OLC opinions -- because, of 

course, what you see there is a very strong 

trend that if there's any statute that might 

trench in any way on the president's 

prerogatives, which they -- they adopt -- they 

interpret it to avoid that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If a president sells

MR. SAUER: That sounds like, similar 

to the bribery example, likely not immune. Now, 

if it's structured as an official act, he would 

have to be impeached and convicted first

 before --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What does that mean, 

if it's structured as an official act? 

MR. SAUER: Well, I don't know in the 

hypothetical whether or not that would be an 

official act.  You'd probably have to have more 

details to apply the Blassingame analysis or 

even the Fitzgerald analysis that we've been 

talking about. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about if a 

president orders the military to stage a coup? 

MR. SAUER: I -- I think that, as the 

Chief Justice pointed out earlier, where there's 

a whole series of, you know, sort of guidelines 

against that, so to speak, like the UCMJ --

prohibits the military from following a 

plainfully unlawful act, if one adopted Justice 

Alito's test, that would fall outside. 

Now, if one adopts, for example, the 

Fitzgerald test that we advance, that might well 

be an official act and he would have to be, as

 But I emphasize to the Court that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, he's gone.

 Let's say this president who ordered the 

military to stage a coup, he's no longer 

president, he wasn't impeached, he couldn't be

 impeached.  But -- but he ordered the military 

to stage a coup.  And you're saying that's an 

official act? 

MR. SAUER: I think it would depend on 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's immune? 

MR. SAUER: I think it would depend on 

the circumstances whether it was an official 

act. If it were an official act, again, he 

would have to be impeached and convicted. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what does that 

mean, depend on the circumstances?  He was the 

president.  He is the commander in chief.  He 

talks to his generals all the time.  And he told 

the generals:  I don't feel like leaving office, 

I want to stage a coup. 

Is -- is -- is that immune?

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That answer sounds to 

me as though it's like, yeah, under my test,

MR. SAUER: Well, it certainly sounds 

very bad, and that's why the Framers have -- and

And that is the wisdom of the Framers. 

What they viewed as the risk that needed to be

 guarded against was not the fact -- the notion 

that the president might escape, you know, 

criminal prosecution for something, you know, 

sort of very, very unlikely in these unlikely 

scenarios. They viewed much more likely and 

much more destructive to the Republic the risk

 of factional strife discussed by George 

Washington --

JUSTICE KAGAN: The Framers did not 

put an immunity clause into the Constitution. 

They knew how to.  There were immunity clauses 

in some state constitutions.  They knew how to 

give legislative immunity.  They didn't provide 

immunity to the president. 

And, you know, not so surprising, they 

were reacting against a monarch who claimed to 

be above the law. Wasn't the whole point that 

the president was not a monarch and the 

president was not supposed to be above the law? 

MR. SAUER: I would say two things in 

response to that.  Immunity -- they did put an 

immunity clause in in a sense.  They put in the 

Executive Vesting Clause, which was originally

 principle that's set forth in the very broad 

language of Marbury against Madison.

 And also, they did discuss and 

consider what would be the checks on the

 presidency.  And they did not say, oh, we need

 to have criminal prosecution.  Right there at 

the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin 

says, we don't have that. That's not an option. 

Everybody cried out against that as 

unconstitutional.  The structural check we're 

adopting is impeachment.  And they're very clear 

on that in pages 64 to 69 of the second volume 

of Farent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Just returning to 

the Chief Justice's hypothetical about the 

ambassador sale and bribery, Congress has a 

statute that specifically names the president

bribery, presumably after he leaves office.

Congress speaks clearly, couldn't a statute like

 that -- Congress provide a statute like that 

that would allow all manner of evidence to come

 in to prove the case?

 MR. SAUER: I think our position is 

that would have to be an unofficial act, purely 

private conduct, for that prosecution to go

 forward.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  But --

but outside the core areas of executive power, 

if there is a clear statement from Congress that 

something is unlawful and it applies to the 

president, I -- I'm struggling to see why in 

that case perhaps the evidence could come in. 

MR. SAUER: Yeah.  The strongest 

possible case in our view is what you've 

described as kind of the core executive powers, 

the unrestrictable powers within the meaning of 

Seila Law. But, again, the holding of, for 

example, Brewster and Johnson that we've relied 

on doesn't turn on how central it is of -- of a 

legislative act.  It just says, if it's an 

official act, which, here, we would say is --

applies basically the outer perimeter test of 

Fitzgerald against Nixon.  That doesn't come in.

 that their successors would criminally prosecute 

them for their acts in office, whether it's --

 whether they've engaged in drone strikes -- all

 that might be created is for presidents to try

 to pardon themselves.

of that until Your Honor asked it.  That is 

certainly one incentive that might be created. 

What we think is most important is --

answered whether a president can do that. 

Happily --

 going to have to make a controversial decision

 where his political opponents are going to come

 after him the minute he leaves office?  Is that

 going to unduly deter, is that going to dampen 

the ardor of that president to do what our

 constitutional structure demands of him or her,

 which is bold and fearless action in the face of

 controversy? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And perhaps, if he 

feels he has to, he'll pardon himself every --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  If the president

 gives an unlawful order, call in the troops,

 what -- all the examples we've heard, it --

 every subordinate beneath him faces criminal

 prosecution, don't they?

 MR. SAUER: That is what Gouverneur

 Morris said explicitly at the Constitutional 

Convention, that his co-agitators could be

 prosecuted.  There is an important caveat 

because, of course, there would have to be a --

a statute that would govern that for them to be 

prosecuted to that extent. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Oh, we've got lots 

of statutes.  The criminal law books are -- are 

replete.  But -- I mean, do you agree, is that 

one check that's available? 

MR. SAUER: Absolutely.  And, again, 

the only caveat that I was making is, if that 

statute was doing what Marbury says you can't 

do, which is going after the subordinates to 

restrict, for example, a core executive 

function, the Franklin clear statement rule 

might be triggered, and -- you might not be able 

to go after that president. 

So I don't think Congress can say,

 well, we can't go after the president directly,

 but we're going to criminalize the way that the

 president speaks to Congress under the exercise 

of the Recommendations Clause, and, therefore,

 we're going to put in a criminal statute that

 says, if you provide false information to

 Congress in -- in carrying out the president's

 recommendation powers, you -- you can be

 immediately prosecuted.  That would at least be 

a very difficult question. 

But the fundamental point of drawing 

that distinction between the president himself 

and his co-agitators, in the word of Gouverneur 

Morris at the Constitutional Convention, is an 

excellent distinction. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Kavanaugh? 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Just to follow up 

on the OLC opinions question, as you read them 

and I think I read them, they articulate a clear 

statement rule, as do this Court's cases for 

covering official acts.  And your point, I 

think, but I just want to underscore this, is 

that none of the statutes alleged here or cited 

here have a clear statement covering the

 president, therefore, meaning that the president 

can't be charged for any official acts under

 this -- under these statutes.

 MR. SAUER: That's absolutely correct.

 They're extended way beyond.  I mean, this is --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Now that's

 separate from the question of what's official

 versus what's personal.  But, for that bucket 

that is official, there's no clear statement, 

period? 

MR. SAUER:  That's right.  And as to 

purely private conduct, we don't think the clear 

statement rule would be invoked. But, as to 

official acts, these statutes, the ones charged 

in the indictment, are just way far afield from 

purporting to criminalize in clear terms the 

president's official acts. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then your --

just to clarify this, the -- the president's not 

above the law, the president's not a king, the 

Founders thought that. I think your point in 

response to that is the president is subject to 

prosecution for all personal acts, just like 

every other American for personal acts. The 

question is acts taken in an official capacity.

MR. SAUER: That's correct.  And even 

those, of course, if there was impeachment and 

conviction, could be prosecuted on our view. 

And we'd emphasize the whole series of

 structural checks in addition to that which

 deter those kind -- and have successfully 

deterred presidential misfeasance for 234 years.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Then, on the 

source of immunity, it's not explicit in the 

Constitution, but also executive privilege is 

not explicit in the Constitution, yet in United 

States versus Nixon, the Court unanimously said 

that the Article II executive power in the 

Constitution encompassed executive privilege. 

And the same principle presumably would apply to 

executive immunity being encompassed within that 

executive power as historically understood. 

MR. SAUER: That's absolutely correct. 

And there's a very telling passage in Free 

Enterprise Fund where this Court talked about 

how there's a letter from James Madison to 

Thomas Jefferson at the time of the founding 

where Madison said, hey, the -- as to the 

removal power, they did not expressly take this 

away, so the 1789 Congress understood that it

 So, if the original understanding of 

the Executive Vesting Clause is broad enough to

 encompass that, it would have to be expressly 

taken away, which is the opposite of the 

presumption that they're advancing here.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then, lastly, 

I think you've acknowledged in response to 

others' questions that some of the acts in the 

indictment are private and your view is that 

some are official.  Is it your position then 

that that analysis of which is which should be 

undertaken in the first instance by the D.C.

you've argued that the Impeachment Clause

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So there are

 many other people who are subject to

 impeachment, including the nine sitting on this 

bench, and I don't think anyone has ever 

suggested that impeachment would have to be the 

gateway to criminal prosecution for any of the

 many other officers subject to impeachment.

 So why is the president different when 

the Impeachment Clause doesn't say so? 

MR. SAUER: Someone very important has 

made the opposite suggestion as to the president 

himself, which is Solicitor General Bork, which 

is reaffirmed in the OLC opinions on this, where 

the -- where Solicitor General Bork, in 1973, as 

to the issue of the vice president, reviewed the 

historical materials, and he said the sequence 

is mandatory only as to the president. 

That is DOJ's view of the original 

understanding of the Impeachment Judgment 

Clause, which is exactly our position.  The 

sequence is mandatory only as to the president. 

Keep in mind that the criminal prosecution of a 

president -- president prior to impeachment 

contradicts, in our view, the plain language of

 And so we say that that practice,

 whatever its validity, should not be extended to 

this novel context, where it clashes with the

 constitutional structure.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  What if the criminal

 conduct isn't discovered until after the 

president is out of office, so there was no 

opportunity for impeachment? 

MR. SAUER: We say the Framers assumed 

the risk that -- of under-enforcement by 

adopting these very structural checks.  As 

Justice Scalia said in Morrison against Olson, 

the separation of powers prevents us from 

righting every wrong, but it does so that we do 

not lose liberty. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And -- and 

the Special Counsel makes a point that I think 

is a pretty compelling one.  You admit that if 

the president were successfully impeached that 

he could be criminally prosecuted after 

impeachment, right?

convicted, not impeached. He must be convicted.

 That word "conviction" is right there in the

 clause.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Okay. 

Granted. But you also say that these criminal

 statutes, unless they explicitly mention the

 president, don't apply to him. So how can you 

say that he would be subject to prosecution 

after impeachment while at the same time saying 

that he's exempt from these criminal statutes? 

MR. SAUER: Well, there are statutes, 

as they concede, where a president -- Congress 

has purported to do so. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  A few.  Two or 

three. 

MR. SAUER: They haven't done a 

comprehensive review.  I think it -- this looks 

like all they did was text search for 

"president" in 18 U.S. Code.  Again, under 

Franklin, that's a very telling indication that 

the word "president" is not in the statute isn't 

necessarily a -- a -- a magic word requirement,

more fundamentally than that, they concede there

 are statutes that exist.  In addition to that, 

much impeachment could occur as a result of

 private conduct.

 So the Impeachment Judgment Clause 

does do significant work by authorizing the

 subsequent prosecution of a president there 

because of what the Framers, if you look at what

 they're discussing in the thing, is -- or in the 

Constitutional Convention, is principally 

concerns about private conduct, which, of 

course, we concede are not immune. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So just to 

pick up Justice Kagan's example of a president 

who orders a coup, let's imagine that he is 

impeached and convicted for ordering that coup. 

And let's just accept for the sake of argument 

your position that that was official conduct. 

You're saying that he couldn't be 

prosecuted for that, even after a conviction and 

an impeachment proceeding, if there was not a 

statute that expressly referenced the president 

and made it criminal for the president? 

MR. SAUER: There would have to be 

a -- a statute that made a clear statement that

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I think I now

 understand better your position. In -- in your 

discussions with Justice Kavanaugh, it became

 clear that you are saying that for the private 

acts of a president, there's no immunity, but 

for the official acts of the president, there is 

immunity. 

Is that your position? 

MR. SAUER: I agree with that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So one 

thing that occurs to me is that this sort of 

difficult line-drawing problem that we're having 

with all of these hypotheticals, is this a 

private act or a public act, is being 

necessitated by that assumption, because, of 

course, if official acts didn't get absolute 

immunity, then it wouldn't matter.  We wouldn't 

have to identify which are private and which are 

public, correct?

determination that needs to be made --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But I'm

 just -- I'm just making -- so, to the extent 

we're worried about, like, how do we figure out 

whether it's private or public, we have to -- we 

have to understand that we're only doing that 

because of an underlying assumption that the

 public acts get immunity.  So let me explore 

that assumption. 

Why is it as a matter of theory -- and 

I'm hoping you can sort of zoom way out here --

that the president would not be required to 

follow the law when he is performing his 

official acts? 

Everyone else -- everyone else, there 

are lots of folks who have very high-powered 

jobs, who make a lot of consequential decisions, 

and they do so against the backdrop of potential 

criminal prosecution if they should break the 

law in that capacity. 

And we understand and we know as a 

matter of fact that the president of the United 

States has the best lawyers in the world. When 

he's making a decision, he can consult with

 thing is criminal or not.

 So why would we have a situation in 

which we would say that the president should be

 making official acts without any responsibility

 for following the law?

 MR. SAUER: I respectfully disagree

 with that characterization.  The president

 absolutely does have responsibility.  He 

absolutely is required to follow the law in all 

of his official acts, but the remedy for that is 

the question, could he be subject to personal 

vulnerability, sent to prison --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But --

decision after he leaves office. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But -- but other 

people who have consequential jobs and who are 

required to follow the law make those 

determinations against the backdrop of that same 

kind of risk.  So what is it about the president

president has to be able to act boldly, do --

 response to that --

That's the very sort of inference or reasoning 

that this Court rejected in Fitzgerald. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, but let me just 

-- Fitzgerald was a civil situation in which the 

president actually was in a different position 

than other people because of the nature of his 

job, the high-profile nature and the fact that 

he touches so many different things, when you're 

talking about private civil liability, you know, 

anybody on the street can sue him, we could see 

that the president was sort of different than 

the ordinary person when you say should he be 

immune from civil liability from anybody who 

wants to sue him. 

But, when we're talking about criminal 

liability, I don't understand how the president 

stands in any different position with respect to

 they're in office?

 It's right now the fact that we're 

having this debate because OLC has said that

 presidents might be prosecuted.  Presidents from

 the beginning of time have understood that 

that's a possibility. That might be what has

 kept this office from turning into the kind of

 crime center that I'm envisioning. 

But, once we say no criminal 

liability, Mr. President, you can do whatever 

you want, I'm worried that we would have a worse

feeling constrained to follow the law while he's 

in office.

statutory grounds, we extensively argued not 

just this clear statement rule but a whole 

panoply of clear statement rules --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But that's 

not -- that's not the question presented in this 

case.  The question presented in this case comes 

out of your motion for immunity. So, to bring 

in now an argument that you didn't raise below, 

it seems to me you forfeited it, no?

           JUSTICE JACKSON:  But not to statutory

 interpretation.

 MR. SAUER: I think --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I mean, that -- that 

argument goes to statutory avoidance, you know,

 constitutional avoidance, statutory

 interpretation.  You asked for immunity, which 

is a totally different thing. 

MR. SAUER: I think they're very 

closely related logically.  The question is --

is does immunity exist and to what extent does 

it. And the argument is immunity at least 

exists to the extent that it raises a grave 

constitutional question, and that triggers the 

clear statement rule.  That's a really tight 

logical relationship. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's totally 

circular.  You're -- you -- you -- you use that 

argument to avoid constitutional questions.  You 

are asking us a constitutional question here. 

So it doesn't even make sense to talk about 

clear statement in -- rule the way that it's 

come up in the context of an immunity question.

about it. I had one more question.  Yeah. So

 what -- what is the argument that the president

 of the United States, who you say is bound by 

the law, is not on notice that he has to do his 

job consistent with the law?

 I mean, to the extent that the clear 

statement rule comes in at all, it's about the 

person not being on notice. So I -- I guess I

 don't understand why Congress in every criminal 

statute would have to say and the president is 

included.  I thought that was the sort of 

background understanding that if they're 

enacting a generally applicable criminal 

statute, it applies to the president just like 

everyone else. 

So -- so what is the clear statement 

that would have to be made in this context? 

MR. SAUER: Under Franklin and under 

Public Citizen, Congress has to speak clearly 

before it interferes with the president's 

powers, and we have here an indictment that 

seeks to criminalize objective conduct that 

falls within the heartland of core executive 

authority.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

           MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 This Court has never recognized 

absolute criminal immunity for any public 

official.  Petitioner, however, claims that a 

former president has permanent criminal immunity 

for his official acts, unless he was first 

impeached and convicted.  His novel theory would 

immunize former presidents from criminal 

liability for bribery, treason, sedition, 

murder, and, here, conspiring to use fraud to 

overturn the results of an election and 

perpetuate himself in power. 

Such presidential immunity has no 

foundation in the Constitution.  The Framers 

knew too well the dangers of a king who could do 

no wrong.  They therefore devised a system to 

check abuses of power, especially the use of 

official power for private gain. 

Here, the executive branch is

accountability for Petitioner's alleged misuse 

of official power to subvert democracy.  That is 

a compelling public interest.

 In response, Petitioner raises

 concerns about potential abuses. But 

established legal safeguards provide layers of

 protections, with the Article III courts

 providing the ultimate check.  The existing 

system is a carefully balanced framework.  It 

protects the president but not at the high 

constitutional cost of blanket criminal 

immunity. 

That has been the understanding of 

every president from the framing through 

Watergate and up to today. This Court should 

preserve it. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Dreeben, does the 

president have immunity, or are you saying that 

there's no immunity, presidential immunity, even

the Court today.  The president, as the head of 

the Article II branch, can assert as-applied

 Article II objections to criminal laws that 

interfere with an exclusive power possessed by

 the president or that prevent the president from

 accomplishing his constitutionally assigned

 functions.

 That is the constitutional doctrine 

that currently governs the separation of powers. 

What Petitioner is asking for is a broad blanket 

immunity that would protect the president, a 

former president, from any criminal exposure 

absent impeachment and conviction, which has 

never happened in our history. 

And we submit that is not necessary in 

order to assure that the president can perform 

all of the important tasks that the Constitution 

reposes in him. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Over -- over in the 

not so distant past, the presidents or certain 

presidents have engaged in various activity, 

coups or operations like Operation Mongoose when 

I was a teenager, and yet there were no 

prosecutions.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Why?  If you -- if 

what you're saying is right, it -- it would seem

 that that would have been ripe for criminal

 prosecution of someone. 

MR. DREEBEN: So, Justice Thomas, I

 think this is a central question.  The reason

 why there have not been prior criminal

 prosecutions is that there were not crimes.  And 

I want to explain why there are layers of 

safeguards that assure that former presidents do 

not have to lightly assume criminal liability 

for any of their official acts. 

At the outset, there is a statutory 

construction principle that is applicable here. 

It arises when there is a serious constitutional 

question about applying a criminal statute to 

the president's acts.  It is not -- and I'm sure 

that we will discuss this -- that no statute can 

apply to the president in his official capacity 

absent a designation of the president in it. 

But there is a principle that if there is a 

serious constitutional question, courts will 

strive to construe the statute so that it does 

not apply to the president. 

In addition to that, the president, I

think has been mentioned earlier, has access to

 advice from the attorney general.  And it would 

be a due process problem to prosecute a

 president who received advice from the attorney 

general that his actions were lawful absent the 

kind of collusion or conspiracy that itself 

represented a criminal violation, which I don't

 really see as being a --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well --

MR. DREEBEN: -- realistic option. 

And then, if I could say one more 

thing, because you raised the question about 

potential overseas taking of life, and the 

Office of Legal Counsel has addressed this quite 

specifically. 

There is a background principle of 

criminal law called the public authority 

exception to liability, and it is read into 

federal law unless Congress takes specific 

action to oust it, which it never has done as 

far as I am aware. 

And in a case in which the president 

sought to engage in overseas activity that would

prosecuted for his official acts because the

 well, and that, I think, is the clearest 

statement of the court's holding, which is why

 it concerns me.

 It -- It -- as I read it, it says

 simply a former president can be prosecuted 

because he's being prosecuted.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I would not 

suggest that that's either the proper approach 

in this case or certainly not the government's 

approach.  A prosecution does, of course, invoke 

federal criminal law. The allegations have to 

be presented to a grand jury, which votes upon 

the indictment. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's 

what I -- I mean, shortly after that statement 

in the court, that -- court's opinion, that's 

what they said, but there's no reason to worry 

because the prosecutor will act in good faith 

and there's no reason to worry because a grand 

jury will have returned the indictment. 

Now you know how easy it is in many 

cases for a prosecutor to get a grand jury to 

bring an indictment, and reliance on the faith

 So, if it's tautological and those are

 the only protections that the court of appeals

 below gave and that is no longer your position, 

you're not defending that position, why 

shouldn't we either send it back to the court of 

appeals or issue an opinion making clear that

MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I am 

defending the court of appeals' judgment.  And I 

do think that there are layered safeguards that 

the Court can take into account that will 

ameliorate concerns about unduly chilling 

presidential conduct. 

That concerns us. We are not 

endorsing a regime that we think would expose 

former presidents to criminal prosecution in bad 

faith, for political animus, without adequate 

evidence.  A politically driven prosecution 

would violate the Constitution under Wayte

It's not something within the arsenal 

of prosecutors to do. Prosecutors take an oath.

courts normally look at when you're talking

 about a privilege or immunity question.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think I 

would take issue, Mr. Chief Justice, with the 

idea of taking away immunity. There is no 

immunity that is in the Constitution, unless

 this Court creates it today.  There certainly is

 no textual immunity.  We do not submit that

 that's the end of the story.  United States 

versus Nixon wasn't a textually-based case. 

Neither was Nixon versus Fitzgerald.  We endorse 

both of those holdings. 

But what is important is that no 

public official has ever had the kind of 

absolute criminal immunity that my friend speaks 

of, even with respect to the Speech or Debate 

Clause.  It's very narrow.  It's focused on 

legislative acts.  It's not focused on 

everything that a Congressman does. 

And it responds to a very specific 

historical circumstance that basically involved 

the two other branches potentially harassing 

legislators and preventing them from doing their 

jobs. That's why it ended up in the 

Constitution.

Nothing like that ended up in -- in 

the Constitution for the presidents, and that's 

because one of the chief concerns of the Framers

 was the risk of presidential misconduct.  They

 labored over this.  They adopted an impeachment

 structure that separated removal from office as 

a political remedy from criminal prosecution.

 This departed from the British model.

 The British model was you get impeached and 

criminally prosecuted and convicted in the same 

proceeding.  The Framers did not want that. 

They wanted a political remedy in case a 

president was engaging in conduct that 

endangered the nation.  He could be removed. 

He can't be prosecuted while he's a 

sitting president.  That's been the longstanding 

Justice Department position.

dispute the proposition that a former president 

has some form of immunity.

 everybody must be interpreted differently under 

some circumstances when they are applied to a

 former president.

 Isn't that true?

 MR. DREEBEN: It -- it is true 

because, Justice Alito, of the general principle

 that courts construe statutes to avoid serious 

constitutional questions. And that has been the

 longstanding practice of the Office of Legal 

Counsel in the Department of Justice. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So this is 

more, I think, than just a -- a quarrel about 

terminology, whether what the former president 

gets is some form of immunity or some form of 

special protection, because it involves this 

difference which I'm sure you're very well aware 

of. 

That if it's just a form of special 

protection, in other words, statutes will be 

interpreted differently as applied to a former 

president, then that is something that has to be 

litigated at trial.  The -- the former president 

can make a motion to dismiss and may cite OLC 

opinions, and the district court may say:  Well,

 interpret it differently, so let's go to trial.

 And then there has to be a trial, and 

that may involve great expense and it may take 

up a lot of time, and during the trial, the --

the former president may be unable to engage in

 other activities that the former president would

 want to engage in.  And then the outcome is 

dependent on the jury, the instructions to the 

jury and how the jury returns a verdict, and 

then it has to be taken up on appeal. 

So the protection is greatly diluted 

if you take the form -- if it takes the form 

that you have proposed.  Now why is that better? 

MR. DREEBEN: It -- it's better 

because it's more balanced.  The -- the blanket 

immunity that Petitioner is arguing for just 

means that criminal prosecution is off the 

table, unless he says that impeachment and 

conviction have occurred. 

Those are political remedies that are 

extremely difficult to achieve.  In a case where 

the conduct, misconduct, occurs close to the end 

of a president's term, Congress is unlikely to

about, to unpack it a little more, do you agree 

that there's some aspects of Article II 

presidential power that are exclusive and that 

Congress cannot regulate and therefore cannot 

criminalize? 

MR. DREEBEN: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  For other 

official acts that the president may take that 

are not within that exclusive power, assume for 

the sake of argument this question that there's 

not blanket immunity for those --

but that to preserve the separation of powers, 

to provide fair notice, to make sure Congress 

has thought about this, that Congress has to

 speak clearly to criminalize official acts of 

the president by a specific reference.

 That seems to be what the OLC opinions

 suggest -- I know you have a little bit of a

 disagreement with that -- and what this Court's

 cases also suggest. 

MR. DREEBEN: So, Justice Kavanaugh, 

I'd like -- like to take all of those in turn 

because I don't think this Court's cases speak 

that broadly.  I definitely don't think that the 

Office of Legal Counsel opinions stand for this 

broad proposition that unless the president is 

specifically named, he's not in -- in the 

statute.  And I don't think that that's 

necessary in order to afford adequate protection 

for the president's valid Article II functions. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, you said 

unless -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to 

just get this out and you can incorporate it in 

the answer.  You said unless there's a serious 

constitutional question. 

MR. DREEBEN: Correct.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, it's --

isn't -- it's a serious constitutional question

 whether a statute can be applied to the

 president's official acts.  So wouldn't you 

always interpret the statute not to apply to the

 president, even under your formulation, unless 

Congress had spoken with some clarity?

 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I don't think -- I 

don't think across the board that a serious 

constitutional question exists on applying any 

criminal statute to the president. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The problem is the 

vague stat, you know, obstruction and 371, 

conspiracy to defraud the United States, can be 

used against a lot of presidential activities 

historically with a -- a creative prosecutor who 

wants to go after a president.

backtrack a little bit to the --

the question about the risk is very serious,

 and, obviously, it is a question that this Court

 has to evaluate.

 For the executive branch, our view is

 that there is a -- a balanced protection that

 better serves the interests of the Constitution 

that incorporates both accountability and 

protection for the president. And I want to go 

through the protections that do exist, but 

perhaps it's worth returning at the outset to 

the statutory construction question that you 

raised. 

The Office of Legal Counsel has said 

the offense of bribery, of course, applies to 

the president.  It does not name the president, 

Justice Gorsuch.  Section 201 does not 

specifically name the president. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  Well, 

assume that's personal.  So that's --

think we are kind of narrowing the ground of

 dispute here.  It seems to me there is some --

some area you -- you concede that on official

 acts that Congress cannot criminalize, and now 

we're just talking about the scope.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think it's

 a "just," but I -- I think it's a very 

significant gap between any official act and the 

small core of exclusive official acts.

that, but I -- I want to explore that, okay? 

MR. DREEBEN: Okay.

objects to a -- a piece of legislation that's 

going through. 

MR. DREEBEN: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And it, in fact, 

delays the proceedings in Congress. 

Now, under 1512(c)(2), that might be 

corruptly impeding a proceeding, an official

that delays a vote on a piece of important

 legislation?

 MR. DREEBEN: So I think what you need 

to do is run through all of the very

 president-specific protective layers of

 analysis.  So one of them is whether the statute

 would be construed not to apply to his conduct, 

even if it's not part of that small core of 

things that Congress can't regulate at all. 

If it operates to prevent the 

president from fulfilling his Article II --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, he -- he could 

have given speeches against it.  He did. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But he left -- he --

he -- he did something more, and it -- and it 

corruptly impeded and sought to influence an 

official proceeding. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, so I -- I don't 

know -- we're -- we're starting with the layers, 

I think, of protection.  And we're now down 

through whether the statute would be construed 

to apply to him.  Then there would be a question 

of whether --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Assume it does.

next layer then, which is that the president 

does have access to the attorney general to 

provide legal advice and regularly gets legal

 advice from the -- the attorney general on the 

lawful scope of the president's activities.

 We could go down two tracks here.  One 

is that the attorney general advises him that,

 as an incident of his Article II authority and

 in carrying out the functions of the presidency, 

he can lawfully participate in that protest. 

It's kind of the First Amendment analogue to the 

president's official powers, which the Court is 

exploring in other cases. 

Alternatively, the attorney general 

could advise him, I'm sorry, Mr. President, 

there's nothing in the language of this statute 

that carves you out.  I don't see a serious 

constitutional question in it --

 contextual, correct?

 MR. DREEBEN: Correct.

factors that generally we'll look at? I -- I'm

 Sotomayor, that -- that -- that the way that 

this Court has interpreted statutes that do

 carve out the president -- Justice Kavanaugh

 asked about this -- was very context-specific. 

The Franklin case basically involved a holding 

that we are highly unlikely to say that the

 president is an agency, something that the

 government said would be a peculiar 

understanding of agency, when the effect of it 

would be that we would review the president's 

decisions under statutes for abuse of 

discretion, which is a very extraordinary thing 

to do. 

I think even going back to Marbury --

this is perhaps a point on which I agree with my 

friend.  Marbury says discretionary acts of the 

president are not the kind of thing that the 

Court reviews. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Could 

I go back to your brief and -- and -- and going 

back to what some of my colleagues have asked 

you. There appears to be some narrowing 

principles to the concept that the president is

of that, of 371, conspiracy to defraud the

 open-ended statutory prohibition in that -- that

function by deception, and it has to be done

 with scienter.

 These are not the kinds of activities 

that I think any of us would think a president

 needs to engage in in order to fulfill his 

Article II duties and particularly in a case

 like this one.

 I -- I want to pick up on something 

that the Court said earlier about the 

distinction between a public official acting to 

achieve public ends and a public official acting 

to achieve private ends. 

As applied to this case, the president 

has no functions with respect to the 

certification of the winner of the presidential 

election.  It seems likely that the Framers 

designed the Constitution that way because, at 

the time of the founding, presidents had no 

two-term limit. They could run again and again 

and were expected potentially to want to do 

that. 

So the potential for self-interest 

would explain why the states -- conduct the 

elections.  They send electors to certify who

 then Congress in a joint -- extraordinary joint

 session certifies the vote.

 And the president doesn't have an

 official role in that proceeding.  So it's 

difficult for me to understand how there could 

be a serious constitutional question about 

saying you can't use fraud to defeat that

 function.  You can't obstruct it through 

deception.  You can't deprive millions of voters 

of their right to have their vote counted for 

the candidate who they chose.

-- I understand -- I understand that, Mr. 

Dreeben, but as I said, this case will have 

effects that go far beyond this particular

 prosecution.

 So moving on to the second level of

 protection that the D.C. Circuit cited, federal

 grand juries will shield former presidents from

 unwarranted indictments.

 How much protection is that? 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, it -- it affords 

two levels of protection.  One is the probable 

cause finding requires evidence. I think some 

of the fears about groundless prosecutions 

aren't supported by evidence, and they're not 

going to get out of the starting gate.

 MR. DREEBEN: There are such cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are there?  Yeah?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes.  But I think that

 the other --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Every once in a while 

there's an eclipse too.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that 

that's for the most reason is prosecutors have 

no incentive to bring a case to a grand jury and 

secure an indictment when they don't have 

evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable 

doubt. It's self-defeating. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Then the 

third level is that former presidents enjoy all 

the protections afforded all criminal 

defendants, right? 

I mean, we've discussed that. And 

that may be true at the end of the day, but a 

lot can happen between the time when an 

indictment is returned and the time when the 

former president finally gets vindication 

perhaps on appeal. 

Isn't that correct?

MR. DREEBEN: It -- it is correct, 

Justice Alito, but I think that we should also 

consider the history of this country. As -- as 

members of the Court have observed, it's baked 

into the Constitution that any president knows

 that they are exposed to potential criminal

 prosecution.  My friend says after impeachment

 and conviction.  We don't read the Impeachment

 Judgment Clause that way, but we are -- it's 

common ground that all former presidents have 

known that they could be indicted and convicted. 

And Watergate cemented that 

understanding.  The Watergate smoking gun tape 

involved President Nixon and H.R. Haldeman 

talking about and then deciding to use the CIA 

to give a bogus story to the FBI to shut down a 

criminal investigation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, Mr. Sauer and 

others have identified events in the past where 

presidents have engaged in conduct that might 

have been charged as a federal crime, and you --

you say, well, no, that's not really true.  This 

is page 42 of your brief. 

So what about President Franklin

 Americans during World War II? Couldn't that 

have been charged under 18 U.S.C. 241, 

conspiracy against civil rights?

 MR. DREEBEN: Today, yes.  Given this 

Court's decision in Trump versus United States

 in which the -- you know, Trump versus Hawaii, 

excuse me, where the Court said Korematsu is

 overruled.  I mean, President Roosevelt made

 that decision with the advice of his attorney 

general.  That's a layer of safeguard. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that really true? 

I thought -- I thought Attorney General Biddle 

thought that there was really no threat of 

sabotage, as did J. Edgar Hoover. 

MR. DREEBEN: So I think that there is 

a lot of historical controversy, but it 

underscores that that occurred during wartime. 

It implicates potential commander in chief 

concerns, concerns about the exigencies of 

national defense that might provide an 

as-applied Article II challenge at the time. 

I'm not suggesting today.

 requires under United States versus Lanier that

 the right had been made specific so that there 

is notice to the president, I don't think that

 would have been satisfied.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, we

 could go through other historical examples.  I 

won't do that. Let me just touch briefly on a

 couple of other things. 

One is the relevance of advice of 

counsel, and I wasn't clear what your answer is. 

So, if the president gets advice from the 

attorney general that something is lawful, is 

that an absolute defense? 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, I -- I think that 

it is. Under the principle of entrapment by 

estoppel, this is a due process doctrine that we 

referred to in our brief or reply brief in 

Garland versus Cargill this term at page 19 

where we cited authority of this Court that if a 

authorized government representative tells you 

that what you are about to do is lawful, it 

would be a -- a root violation of due process to 

prosecute you for that.

won't that give presidents an incentive to be 

sure to pick an attorney general who can -- will 

-- who will reliably tell the president that it

 is lawful to do whatever the president wants to

 do if there's any possibly conceivable argument 

in favor of it?

 MR. DREEBEN: So I think the

 constitutional structure protects against that

 risk. The president nominates the attorney 

general and the Senate provides advice and 

consent.  And these are the sort of structural 

checks that have operated for 200 years to 

prevent the kind of abuses that my friend fears 

going forward as a result of this 

once-in-history prosecution.

Because, if a president has the

 have been conceivably charged with committing?

 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I really doubt

 that, Justice Alito.  I mean, it sort of

 presupposes a regime that we have never had 

except for President Nixon and as alleged in the 

indictment here, presidents who are conscious of 

having engaged in wrongdoing and seeking to

 shield themselves. 

I think the political consequences of 

a president who asserted a right of self-pardon 

that has never been recognized, that seems to 

contradict a bedrock principle of our law that 

no person shall be the judge in their own case. 

Those are adequate deterrents, I think, so that 

this kind of dystopian regime is not going to 

evolve. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Let me end 

-- end with just a question about what is 

required for the functioning of a stable 

democratic society, which is something that we 

all want. I'm sure you would agree with me that 

a stable democratic society requires that a

one, even a hotly contested one, leave office

 MR. DREEBEN: Of course.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Now, if a 

-- an incumbent who loses a very close, hotly

 contested election knows that a real possibility

 after leaving office is not that the president 

is going to be able to go off into a peaceful 

retirement but that the president may be 

criminally prosecuted by a bitter political 

opponent, will that not lead us into a cycle 

that destabilizes the functioning of our country 

as a democracy? 

And we can look around the world and 

find countries where we have seen this process, 

where the loser gets thrown in jail. 

MR. DREEBEN: So I think it's exactly 

the opposite, Justice Alito.  There are lawful 

mechanisms to contest the results in an 

election. And outside the record but I think of 

public knowledge, Petitioner and his allies 

filed dozens of electoral challenges and, in my 

understanding, has lost all but one that was not

overturn an election result that's certified by 

a state, you need evidence, you need proof. And

 none of those things were manifested.

 So there is an appropriate way to 

challenge things through the courts with

 evidence.  If you lose, you accept the results.

 That has been the nation's experience.  I think 

the Court is well familiar with that.

routinely, but we succeed more often than not. 

In the vast majority of cases, the innocent do

 go free.  Sometimes they don't, and we have some

 post-conviction remedies for that. But we still

 fail. We've executed innocent people.

 Having said that, Justice Alito went 

through step by step all of the mechanisms that

 could potentially fail.  In the end, if it fails 

completely, it's because we've destroyed our 

democracy on our own, isn't it? 

MR. DREEBEN: It -- it is, Justice 

Sotomayor, and I also think that -- that there 

are additional checks in the system.  Of course, 

the constitutional Framers designed a separated 

powers system in order to limit abuses.  I think 

one of the ways in which abuses are limited is 

accountability under the criminal law for 

criminal violations.  But the ultimate check is 

the goodwill and faith in democracy. 

And crimes that are alleged in this 

case that are the antithesis of democracy, that 

subvert it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  An encouragement 

MR. DREEBEN: -- undermine that.

there is no serious constitutional question that

 the president needs to engage in bribery in

 order to carry out his constitutional functions, 

and the Office of Legal Counsel pointed out that 

bribery is enumerated in the Impeachment Clause. 

So it falls outside of anything that could be

 viewed as inherent in the need of Article II to

 function.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think the 

premise of that OLC opinion was that the bribery 

was simply not official? 

MR. DREEBEN: No. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or is the premise that 

the bribery was official and -- and still the 

president could be prosecuted for it? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think that bribery is 

-- is the kind of hybrid that illustrates the 

abuse of public office for private gain that we 

think is paradigmatic of the kinds of things 

that should be not held to be immune. 

In a bribery case, the public official 

cannot extract the bribe without the official 

power to offer as the quid or the pro. I guess 

the quo actually.  So it -- it really is a crime 

that can only be committed by public officials

who misuse their power, and it was one of the

 things that was most mistrusted.

 Many of the acts that are charged in

 this indictment or that would violate federal 

criminal law similarly involve the misuse of 

official power for private gain.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, if you were to 

say, like, what the line is in this category,

 like, when it is that the statute should be 

understood as precluding presidential 

prosecution and when it is that the statute 

should be understood as allowing it, what 

general principles should guide? 

MR. DREEBEN: So the -- the -- the 

general principles, I think, kind of emerge from 

looking at what the Office of Legal Counsel has 

done. So, for example, with respect to a 

federal statute that prohibited appointments to 

courts of people within certain degrees of 

consanguinity, the Office of Legal Counsel said 

this infringes on a very important appointment 

power of the president, the power to appoint 

federal judges.  It cannot be presumed that 

Congress intended to do that because it would 

raise a very serious constitutional question.

The president is out.

 Then there are categories of statutes

 where the president is in, like, for example, 

the grassroots lobbying statute. The Office of

 Legal Counsel wrote an opinion about that, and 

it said for the president or other public

 officials to go out into the world and to 

promote their programs, that can't be what 

Congress intended to prohibit. 

What it did intend to prohibit is 

using federal funds to gin up -- gin up an 

artificial grassroots campaign that gave the 

appearance of emerging from the people, but it 

was really top-down. And the Office of Legal 

Counsel said the president and officials who 

carry out the president's mandates are subject 

to that statute.  So that's a more nuanced one. 

And then the third example that I will 

give you is the statute that would permit 

prosecution for contempt of Congress.  The 

Office of Legal Counsel concluded that a 

good-faith assertion of executive privilege as a 

reason for not providing information to Congress

of powers in such a manner.

 I think OLC probably would have gone 

on to say, if Congress tried to do it, it would

 be deemed unconstitutional.  But, again, this 

was a statute that did not specifically name the

 president.  There are only two that do that.

 So the entire corpus of federal

 criminal law, including bribery offenses, 

sedition, murder, would all be off limits if it 

were taken to the -- to the -- to the extent 

that some of the questions have suggested and 

for the general principle, does it raise a 

serious constitutional question, and, if so, to 

what extent?  Can it be carved out individually? 

And there may be some instances where 

the statutes here could be carved out and a 

particular act could be found to be protected. 

Or does the statute across the board, in such a 

wide range of applications, somewhat analogous 

to overbreadth analysis, infringe on the 

president's power so that we're going to say 

that -- that the president is just out? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now that set of 

issues, they seem important and may occasionally 

be difficult.

MR. DREEBEN: So I think the Court has 

discretion to reach that issue even though 

Justice Jackson is totally right, it was not 

raised in the district court and it was not 

raised in the court of appeals.

 So, in a case like United States 

versus Grubbs, for example, the Court reached

 out to decide what -- whether anticipatory 

warrants are valid under the Fourth Amendment

 before turning to the question whether the 

triggering condition for an anticipatory warrant 

had to be in the warrant. So that's one

 principle. 

And then a -- a precedent that bears 

some analogy to this is Vermont Natural 

Resources Agency versus United States ex rel 

Stevens.  It was a qui tam case, and the first 

question was whether a state agency was a person 

within the meaning of the False Claims Act, and 

the second question was whether, if the state 

agency was, Eleventh Amendment immunity kicked 

in. 

And the Court wrote an analysis of why 

it could reach both questions.  The reaching the 

person question didn't expand the Court's 

jurisdiction, and it made sense as a matter of 

constitutional avoidance to do that. 

There are some considerations that cut 

against this.  And I -- I want to be clear that

for overall government equities, we are not wild

 about parties who raise a -- an immunity case 

that can be presented to a court on an

 interlocutory appeal and then smuggling in other

 issues.  So we would want to guide the Court not 

to have an expansive approach to that issue.

 But the final thing that I would say

 about this is part of our submission to this

 Court is that the Article I branch and the 

Article II branches are aligned in believing 

that this prosecution is an appropriate way to 

enforce the law, Congress by making the law, the 

current executive by deciding to bring it. 

And since a building block of that 

submission is that Congress actually did apply 

these criminal laws to official conduct, the 

Court may wish to exercise its discretion to 

resolve that issue.

 counts as unofficial here.

 And I'm just wondering what you took 

from his responses and also how you would 

characterize what is official and what is not 

official in this indictment.

 MR. DREEBEN: So I -- I think 

Petitioner conceded that there are acts that are

 not official that are alleged in the indictment. 

And we agree with him on all of that. 

I think I disagree with him on 

everything else that he said about what is 

official and what is not.  Organizing fraudulent 

slates of electors, creating false documentation 

that says I'm an elector, I was appointed 

properly, I'm going to send a -- a vote off to 

Congress that reflects that Petitioner won 

rather than the candidate that actually got the 

most votes and who was ascertained by the 

governor and whose electors were appointed to 

cast votes, that is not official conduct.  That 

is campaign conduct. 

And I think that the D.C. Circuit in 

the Blassingame case did draw an appropriate 

distinction.  A first-term president who's

We do agree that the Department of

president's official power.  In many ways, we 

think that aggravates the nature of this 

offense.

talking about exercising the appointment and

 removal power.  No. What we're seeking to

 impose criminal liability for is a conspiracy to 

use fraud to subvert the election, one means of

 to be complicit in this.

 The case would have been no different

made the scheme more dangerous, but it would not

If we are operating under a Fitzgerald

 versus Nixon lens and looking at this the way 

that we look at things when there is a private

 lawsuit filed against the president, we take a 

very broad view of what the outer perimeter of 

official presidential action is in order to be

 as protective of the president against private 

lawsuits that, as this Court explained in Nixon

 versus Fitzgerald, can be very deleterious to 

the president's conduct of business. 

So, if we were putting this under a 

Fitzgerald lens, we would then have to answer to 

the question:  Was he acting in -- in the 

capacity as office-seeker, or was he acting in 

the capacity as office-holder? 

And if you run through the indictment, 

you can find support for those two 

characterizations, and the Department of Justice 

has not yet had to come to grips with how we 

would analyze that set of interactions.

Gorsuch?

 heard you thought that the Blassingame framework 

was the appropriate one.

 Is that right?

 MR. DREEBEN: Largely -- largely yes,

 Justice Gorsuch.  We -- we agree with the idea 

of the distinction between office-holder and

 office-seeker.

 We also agree that if it's objectively 

reasonable to view the activities as those of 

office-holder, then the Fitzgerald immunity 

kicks in.  I think we would look more at the 

content of the actual interaction in order to 

make that determination than Blassingame 

suggested at least on the facts of that case 

might be appropriate. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Can you give me an 

example of what you have in mind?  I'm just 

trying to understand what nuance you're 

suggesting. 

MR. DREEBEN: So -- so -- so 

Blassingame adopted a, you know, generally very 

favorable, pro-government framework that -- we 

endorse in tried civil cases. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: I would have 

thought, yeah.

since the Blassingame decision, but let me offer 

a few thoughts that, Justice Gorsuch, I think

objective contextual indications to try to see 

whether the president was acting as a campaigner 

as opposed to --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  President, yeah.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that -- that 

that decision can also be made by looking at 

what the president actually said. And let me 

illustrate that with an allegation that I think

 my friend --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Briefly.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- talked -- briefly.

 That it -- in one of the interactions between 

Petitioner and a state official, Petitioner is 

alleged to have said:  All I need you -- you to 

do is to find me 11,000 votes and change. 

I think, if you look at that -- that 

content, it's pretty clear that Petitioner is 

acting in the capacity as office-seeker, not as 

president.  And we would look at that content. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Okay. But 

the test -- I'm just focused on the legal test. 

MR. DREEBEN: Right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm not hearing any 

objections to it.

the D.C. Circuit placed more content

And then I wanted to understand, on the core 

immunity or whatever word we use, that -- that 

it seems to me that we're narrowing the ground

 of dispute here considerably, do -- do we look 

at motives, the president's motives for his

 actions?

 I mean, the -- for example, he has 

lots of war powers, as we discussed, but he

 might use them in order to enhance his election, 

his personal interests.  Is that a relevant 

consideration when we're looking at core powers? 

MR. DREEBEN: So I -- I -- I am 

thinking of this more as looking at the 

objective of the activity as opposed to the kind 

of subjective motive in the sense that Your 

Honor is talking about.  I think that there is a 

lot of concern about saying an electoral motive 

to be reelected as such --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

MR. DREEBEN: -- is problematic --

maybe ask this first -- is removing an

 appointee, a presidential appointee, a core

 power or a non-core power in your world?

 MR. DREEBEN: So, here -- here, I

 might need to differentiate between the 

principal officers that this Court in cases like 

Myers and Seila Law has regarded as having 

constitutional status of being removable at will 

from inferior officers, where Congress does have 

some regulatory latitude to impose restrictions 

on removal.

MR. DREEBEN: All right.  Putting --

putting that aside, yes, appointing a principal 

officer is a core power. I am not prepared to 

say that there is no potential criminal 

regulation to say you can't do it for corrupt 

purposes, to enrich yourself, for example.

a little bit more appropriate because it's not 

involved in this case. The Department has not 

had to take a position on exactly how these core 

powers would be resolved under an as-applied 

constitutional analysis.  None is involved in

 Everything he does --

MR. DREEBEN: Yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- he wants to get

 reelected.  And if you're -- if you're allowing 

in motive to color that, I -- I -- I'm wondering 

how much is left of -- of either the core or

 non-core powers under your view?

 MR. DREEBEN: So I -- I -- I would be 

fine with carving that out and deeming that to 

be something that's intrinsic in our electoral 

system.  We're not talking about applying 

criminal law to somebody who makes an 

announcement that this program will be good for 

the United States, and somebody could come along 

and say, well, you really did it to get 

re-elected. 

Leaving aside whether any of that 

violates a criminal law -- I know that the next 

question is assume that it does -- I'm doubtful 

that it, in fact, does because I don't think 

criminal laws generally operate on motives as 

opposed to objectives and purposes.  But --

 JUSTICE GORSUCH: -- you can frame a

 motive as an intention and an intention as a

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So let's put that

 MR. DREEBEN: I understand.  Well, 

putting -- putting that aside, that really to me 

falls in a very different category.  And it is 

also possible --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So there are some 

motives or intents that -- that are cognizable 

and others that aren't?  I mean, it's -- it's 

awkward, right, when we look at back at, like, 

the injunction, back to Marbury and the early

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- writing a rule

 for --

MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- for the ages. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes.  And -- and I think 

I would start by looking at the statutes and --

and seeing what restrictions they do place on 

the president's conduct. 

And, for example, the statute that 

prohibits fraud to defeat the lawful functions 

of the United States, the statute defines what 

the purpose is that the defendant has to have in 

mind. It has to be to defeat something that the 

United States is doing and it has to be by 

deception. 

I don't think that that gets us into 

the realm of motive hunting in the area where we 

are as concerned, I think, as the Court would 

be, about doing something that would undermine 

the presidency and the executive branch.

views on the clarity and the scope of that

 statute.  I think, if the Court does interpret 

"corruptly" as involving a consciousness of 

wrongdoing and elevates that to consciousness of 

illegality, then we're in a different realm. 

Wanting to get re-elected is not a -- an illegal

 motive, and you don't have to worry about 

prosecuting presidents for that.

 the independent counsel structure.  And -- and 

what I'm worried about here is that that was 

kind of let's relax Article II a bit for the

 needs of the moment.  And I'm worried about the

 similar kind of situation applying here.

 That was a prosecutor investigating a

someone picked from the opposite party, the 

current president, and -- usually --

thing is certain, however: it involves

 investigating and perhaps prosecuting a 

particular individual. Can one imagine a less 

equitable manner of fulfilling the Executive

 responsibility to investigate and prosecute? 

What would the reaction be if, in an area not 

covered by this statute, the Justice Department 

posted a public notice inviting applicants to 

assist in an investigation and possible 

prosecution of a certain prominent person?  Does 

this not invite what Justice Jackson described 

as 'picking the man and then searching the law 

books or putting investigators to work to pin 

some offense on him?'  To be sure, the 

investigation must relate to the area of 

criminal offense" specified by the statute, but 

that has often been and nothing prevents it from 

being very broad.  I paraphrased at the end 

because it was referring to the judges. 

MR. DREEBEN: Mm-hmm. Yes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's the concern

 All that, I want you to try to allay

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all, the

structural features that emphasized independence 

at the expense of accountability.  We don't have 

that regime now.  But, even under that regime, 

Justice Kavanaugh, I think, if you look at 

Lawrence Walsh's report on Iran/Contra, I think 

this goes to a very fundamental point for the 

Court to consider. 

Judge Walsh said:  I investigated 

these matters.  The proof did not nearly come 

close to establishing criminal violations.  So 

we've lived from Watergate through the present, 

through the independent counsel era with all of 

its flaws, without these prosecutions having 

gone off on a runaway train.  We --

We now are inside the Justice

the attorney general, so the special counsel 

regulations now don't operate the way that the 

independent counsel regulations do. 

And this Court would have something to

-- I do not mean to suggest anything of the sort

misleading under vague statutes. So President

 I realize that the Court can say:

 Well, what if they were?  And -- and then I

 think you get to what I would regard as a hard

 constitutional question that I would probably

 guide the Court away from trying to resolve 

today, although I do think it's very different 

from our case and distinguishable in important 

ways, but you're dealing here with two branches 

of government that have a paramount interest in 

the integrity and freedom of their interactions 

with each other. 

On the one hand, the president, of 

course, should be very free to send, usually, 

his cabinet officials and sub-cabinet officials 

to testify to Congress to provide them with the 

information needed to enact legislation and to 

make national policy.  And we're very concerned 

about anything that would trammel that. 

On the other side of the equation, 

Congress has a compelling interest in receiving 

accurate information and at the very least --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  How about

 President Obama's drone strikes?

 MR. DREEBEN: So the -- the Office of 

Legal Counsel looked at this very carefully and 

determined that, number one, the federal murder

 statute does apply to the executive branch.  The 

president wasn't personally carrying out the 

strike, but the aiding and abetting laws are

 broad, and it determined that a public authority 

exception that's built into statutes and that 

applied particularly to the murder statute, 

because it talks about unlawful killing, did not 

apply to the drone strike. 

So this is actually the way that the 

system should function.  The Department of 

Justice takes criminal law very seriously.  It 

runs it through the analysis very carefully with 

established principles.  It documents them.  It 

explains them.  And then the president can go 

forward in accordance with it. And there is no 

risk of prosecution for that course of activity.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Dreeben, I want 

to pick up with that public authority defense. 

So I'm looking at the OLC memo that David Barron 

wrote that you cited in your briefs, and in --

he describes the public authority defense citing

 the model penal code.  There are a few different

 definitions, but I'll just highlight this one: 

Justifying conduct which is required or 

authorized by the law defining the duties or 

functions of a public officer, the law governing 

the armed services or lawful conduct of war, or 

any other provision of law imposing a public 

duty. 

That sounds a lot like dividing a line 

between official and private conduct.  It -- it 

-- I think it's narrower, and I recognize it's a 

defense, not an immunity, but when we look at --

when you look at the definition of it, are you 

acting within the scope of authority conferred 

by law or discharging a duty conferred by law? 

I think it's narrower than 

Blassingame, narrower than Nixon versus 

Fitzgerald.

sounds like to me. Do you agree or disagree?

 MR. DREEBEN: You -- you know, Justice 

Barrett, I certainly understand the intuition

 that when you act outside of your lawful 

authority, you've kind of gone on a frolic and 

detour, you're no longer carrying it out. I 

don't really think that that quite works for

 presidential activity.

 The only way that he could have 

implemented the orders is by exercising his 

commander-in-chief authority over the armed 

forces or his authority to supervise the 

executive branch.  Those seem like core 

executive acts to me. There is such a 

possibility as an unlawful executive act. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I'm not sure that I 

understand your answer.  I mean, I was thinking, 

it -- it seemed to me that in your briefs and 

today, when you referred to the public authority 

defense --

MR. DREEBEN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- you said that's 

one of the built-in protections and --

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- because, in some 

of these instances, when the president takes 

such actions that, you know, the courts have 

been asking you might this result in criminal

 prosecution, you say: Well, he could raise this

 public authority defense.

 And so I'm saying isn't this public 

authority defense, if raised, doesn't it sound 

like a defense that says:  Well, I had -- I was 

authorized by law to discharge this function? 

MR. DREEBEN: And, therefore, I acted 

lawfully?

defense might not apply because you had a bad

 motive in doing so?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I -- I -- I don't 

think so, Justice Barrett.  I think that it 

operates based on objective facts disclosed to 

counsel. Counsel then provides the advice, in 

this case the Department of Justice, and it --

it's an objectively valid defense.  It's a 

complete defense to prosecution. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So what would be so 

bad -- I mean, one thing that strikes me as 

different -- well, one thing that's obviously 

different between a public authority defense and 

immunity is an interlocutory appeal and having 

it resolved at the outset. 

MR. DREEBEN: Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  What would be so bad 

about having a question like that resolved at 

the threshold, having it be an immunity, the 

same kind of question that could be brought up 

as a defense later, but have it be brought up at 

the threshold as an immunity, and then an 

interlocutory appeal would be available --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- and it would be a 

freedom from standing trial but not a -- a jet 

-- not a get-out-of-jail-free card?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, I -- I understand

 that, and I think that if the Court believed

 that that was the appropriate way to craft

 presidential protections, it has the authority 

to craft procedural rules that implement its

 Article II concerns. 

That said, public authority is --

we're calling it a defense, but under many 

statutes, it's actually an exception to 

liability itself.  And what you're really 

talking about is trying the general issue. 

And, generally, in criminal cases, 

even cases that involve First Amendment issues, 

like threat statutes, the jury is the 

determinant of the facts.  And I have a little 

bit of difficulty with the idea of trying the 

whole public authority issue separately to the 

judge and having that go up on interlocutory 

appeal with review of facts before you could 

ever get it forward into a criminal case. 

That said, if -- I would prefer a

them are judge questions that could be resolved 

on the face of the indictment. If the

 Department of Justice ever returned an 

indictment that said the issuance of this pardon 

or this series of pardons constituted

 obstruction of justice, I have a little 

difficulty hypothesizing it, but a motion could 

be made on the face of the indictment that says 

Article II precludes Congress from regulating 

these activities; the indictment needs to be 

dismissed. 

And if the Court wished to attach to 

that kind of a rule interlocutory appeal, then 

that -- that would be a -- a lesser safeguard 

than the -- the one that my friend is proposing 

here. 

Other kinds of defenses, though, 

really do intersect with the general issue.  And 

for those, I have a much greater time seeing how 

the Court could implement that.  And would there 

be costs in going to trial?  Yes.  There is no 

perfect system here.  We are trying to design a 

system that preserves the effective functioning 

of the presidency and the accountability of a 

former president under the rule of law.

And the perfect system that calibrates 

all of those values probably has not been 

devised. I think that the system that we have

 ancillary rules.  It is different from the

 prosecutions --

of the protections that you're talking about are 

internal protections that the federal government

which obviously are not applicable at the many, 

many, many, many state and local jurisdictions 

across the country.

What do you have to say to that?

 MR. DREEBEN: So that raises a 

Supremacy Clause issue, and the Court would run

 a Supremacy Clause analysis that would probably

 start with basic principles like McCulloch

 versus Maryland.  The states do not have the 

authority to burden federal functions and would 

then kind of move through In re Neagle, where 

the Court said that a state murder prosecution 

of a federal official guarding a Supreme Court 

Justice and who fired a shot was not 

permissible. 

If the Court thought that you needed a 

more categorical rule for the states, I think 

the Supremacy Clause certainly leaves it within 

the Court's prerogative to determine that the 

president, unlike all other officials, deserves 

more of a robust federal defense than what I 

have just described. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it would still 

be a defense in -- in the states?  It wouldn't 

be -- I mean --

MR. DREEBEN: Well, any --

to say, well, the president -- there are not 

going to be these prosecutions that are

 politically motivated, the things that Justice 

Kavanaugh was referring to that might be the

 danger of -- of this system, one thing that we 

have to worry about, that might not carry the

 day, but, you know, that's a concern.

 It's totally different when you take 

it outside of the Department of Justice and its 

structures and then you throw it out elsewhere, 

the idea across -- across the states, the idea 

of an immunity, I think, has a lot more purchase 

if you're talking about something that protects 

the former president from standing trial and the 

stake in state and local level. 

MR. DREEBEN: So I -- I -- I don't 

know that you would have to design a system in 

which the president would have to stand trial at 

the state and local level.  It's certainly 

within the Court's authority as a matter of 

Supremacy Clause law to find an immunity.  But 

we -- we have been talking here about -- at some 

length on the distinction between official acts 

and private acts. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah.

MR. DREEBEN: That will have to be

 determined by some sort of a process.  Any

 immunity defense that the Court announces can

 still be met by a state assertion that we're

 prosecuting private conduct.  You're going to 

have to have some process.

 I think having some legal process is

 not a reason to cast aside a nuanced system that 

actually looks at what protections are necessary 

as opposed to what would provide the absolute 

maximum insulation for former presidents even if 

we acknowledge that it's highly prophylactic. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Totally agree, and I 

wasn't actually contrasting the absolute 

immunity rule.  I was saying that --

MR. DREEBEN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- if there was some 

sort of official private -- there are 

consequences --

MR. DREEBEN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- towards -- about 

making immunity.  Okay. 

And since you bring up the private 

acts, this is my last question.  So I -- I had

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- you say, "Even if 

the Court were inclined to recognize some

 immunity for a former president's official acts, 

it should remand for trial because the

the private conduct would be sufficient. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

on that, Justice Barrett.

 First -- first of all, there's really

 an integrated conspiracy here that had different

 components as alleged in the indictment, working

 with -- with private lawyers to achieve the 

goals of the fraud and, as I said before, the --

the Petitioner reaching for his official powers 

to try to make the conspiracies more likely to

 succeed.  We would like to present that as an 

integrated picture to the jury so that it sees 

the sequence and the gravity of the conduct and 

why each step occurred. 

That said, if the Court were to say 

that the fraudulent elector scheme is private, 

reaching out to state officials as a candidate 

is private, trying to exploit the violence after 

January 6th by calling senators and saying 

please delay the certification proceeding, is 

private campaign activity, we still think, 

contrary to what my friend said, that we could 

introduce the interactions with the Justice 

Department, the efforts to pressure the vice 

president, for their evidentiary value as 

showing the defendant's knowledge and intent. 

And we would take a jury instruction that would

say you may not impose criminal culpability for 

the actions that he took. However, you may 

consider it insofar as it bears on knowledge and

 intent.

 That's the usual rule with protected 

speech, for example, under Wisconsin versus 

Mitchell. My friend analogizes this to the 

Speech or Debate Clause, but we don't think the 

Speech or Debate Clause has any applicability 

here. It's a very explicit constitutional 

protection that says senators and 

representatives shall not be questioned in any 

other place.  So it carries an evidentiary 

component that's above and beyond whatever 

official act immunity he is seeking. 

And the last thing I would say on this 

is we think that the concerns about the use of 

evidence of presidential conduct that might 

otherwise be official and subject to executive 

privilege is already taken care of by United 

States versus Nixon.  That balances the 

president's interests in confidentiality against 

the need of the judicial system for all 

available facts to get to the truth. 

And once that has been overcome, we

private from official acts and saying that that

acts bucket that the case should be allowed to 

proceed? 

MR. DREEBEN: Correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Because, in an 

ordinary case, it wouldn't be stopped just 

because some of the acts are allegedly 

immunized, even if people agree that some are 

immunized, if there are other acts that aren't, 

the case would go forward?

back to the clear statement argument, I -- I --

I'm struggling with that argument because my

 understanding was that when a charged criminal 

statute is read narrowly in the presidential 

context to not apply to the president, a 

constitutional question is being avoided, so 

that you're doing that to avoid having to deal 

with the constitutional question.

 So what is the constitutional question 

that is being avoided in those kinds of 

situations? 

MR. DREEBEN: A serious one. This is 

just an application of this Court's ordinary 

construction of criminal statutes that if there 

is an available interpretation that would avoid 

a serious constitutional question, the Court's 

preference is to --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. 

MR. DREEBEN: -- go in that way. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And the nature -- I 

guess I'm going at what is -- what is -- my 

understanding is that what is being avoided in 

that situation is the question of whether a 

former president or, you know, can be held 

criminally liable for doing the alleged act that

is being asserted in that statute, consistent

 with the Constitution.

 So we look at the statute.  It's got

 some elements in it. And we are saying, well,

 geez, if this statute and those elements apply 

to the president's conduct in this situation, 

we'd have to answer the question can the

 president be held liable, consistent with the

 Constitution, for that behavior, is that right? 

MR. DREEBEN: So the first step in 

that analysis, I just want to --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, please. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but the first step 

is, is there ambiguity. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  Right. 

MR. DREEBEN: And these statutes apply 

to any person.  They apply to whoever.  There's 

no ambiguity in those phrases.  This Court in 

Nardone versus United States concluded that 

similar words, "any person" --

officials.

 guess I'm just trying to get at we're avoiding a

 constitutional question if we do that in -- in

 the ordinary case, and -- and what's confusing 

to me about this case is that we're not being 

asked to avoid the constitutional question.

 In fact, the question of whether or

 not the president can be held liable consistent

 with the Constitution or does he have immunity 

is the question that's being presented to us. 

So I don't understand how the clear 

statement kind of analysis even works.  It seems 

completely tautological to me for us to hold 

that presidents cannot be prosecuted under any 

criminal statute without a clear statement from 

Congress to avoid the question of whether or not 

the Constitution allows them to be prosecuted. 

We'd have to have a reason, right?  I 

mean, we'd have -- we'd have to have a rationale 

for applying the -- clear statement rule. 

MR. DREEBEN: I -- I think the Court 

would have to have some rationale that's not 

evident in either the existing doctrine or the 

text. And just one data point for the Court in 

thinking about how the clear statement rule 

works.

In United States versus Sun-Diamond, a 

case about gratuities that the Court is probably

 familiar with, Justice Scalia wrote an opinion

 for a unanimous Court in which he used a 

hypothetical about what would happen if the 

president received a sports replica jersey at a

 typical White House event.  Would that violate

 Section 201(c)?  And the Court offered a 

construction that it had to be for or because an 

official act to avoid that problem. 

I think, if there was such a 

well-received understanding that presidents are 

not included in general federal criminal law 

unless the president is specifically named, 

which he is not in Section 201, Justice Scalia 

would have thought of that and some member of 

the Court would have reacted, and none did. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me 

go on to ask about what you take the 

Petitioner's position to be in this case because 

we've had a lot of talk about drawing the lines. 

Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch suggested 

that we should be thinking about Blassingame and 

that within the -- first, we have private versus 

official and then within official now we have

 something about core acts versus other acts as 

we try to figure out, you know, at what level

 the president is going to have immunity.

 But I took the Petitioner's argument 

in this case not to be inviting us to engage in 

that kind of analysis. I thought he was arguing 

that all official acts get immunity -- of? And 

so I didn't understand us to be having to drill 

down on which official acts do. 

And so my question is, why isn't it 

enough for the purposes of this case, given what 

the Petitioner has argued, to just answer the 

question of whether all official acts get 

immunity? 

MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is enough. 

And if the Court -- answers that question the 

way that the government has submitted, that 

resolves the case. 

I -- I want to make a clarification 

that I may have left the Court with some 

uncertainty about.  The official act analysis 

that my friend is talking about is the 

Fitzgerald versus Nixon outer perimeter test, 

which is extremely protective of the president. 

It's not looking at core versus ancillary.  It's

for private civil lawsuits. That is not a great

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  That's an absolute

 immunity kind of concept, right?

 MR. DREEBEN: Correct. That's right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Anything that's

 official in the outer perimeter is not subject

 to liability. 

MR. DREEBEN: That is right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: And so we don't have

MR. DREEBEN: Neither on the theory of 

absolute immunity or on our theory.  On -- on 

his theory, everything's protected.  On our 

theory, there is no immunity, but this is where 

I would draw the distinction. 

There are as-applied constitutional 

challenges that you run through the Youngstown

analysis, and you determine whether there's a 

infringement of Article II.

JUSTICE JACKSON: So what you're

 saying is, even if we reject the absolute

 immunity theory, it's not as though the

 president is -- you know, doesn't have the

 opportunity to make the kinds of arguments that

 arise as -- at the level of, you know, this 

particular act or this particular statute has a

 problem in retrospect. 

I think I hear you saying we should 

not be trying to, in the abstract, set up those 

boundaries ahead of time. As a function of sort 

of blanket immunity, allow each allegation to be 

brought and then we would decide in that 

context. 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, with -- with the 

additional note that Petitioner has never made 

that argument.  And I think it would be up to a 

district court to decide whether to go that 

route. At this point in the litigation, he's 

put all -- all of his eggs in the absolute 

immunity basket.

we -- if we invite -- you know, if we see the 

question presented as broader than that and we

 I mean, I -- I had understood that the

 here, there's really no plausible argument that

 they would fall into core versus not such that

 they are immune.

 MR. DREEBEN: We don't think there are 

any core acts that have been alleged in the 

indictments that would be off limits as a matter 

of Article II.

what the line is, we should probably wait for a 

vehicle that actually presents it in a way that

MR. DREEBEN: I don't see any need in

 have done in office.

 I -- I -- I take that concern.  I

 think it's a real thing.  But I wonder whether 

some of it might also be mitigated by the fact

 that existing administrations have a

 self-interest in protecting the presidency, that 

they understand that if they go after the former 

guy, soon they're going to be the former guy and 

they will have created precedent that will be 

problematic. 

So I wonder if you might comment on 

whether some of the caution from the Justice 

Department and the prosecutors and whatnot comes 

from an understanding that they will soon be 

former presidents as well. 

MR. DREEBEN: I -- I think, 

absolutely.  And -- and I would locate this as a 

structural argument that's built into the 

Constitution itself.  The executive branch, I 

think, as this Court knows, has executive branch 

interests that it at times asserts in opposition 

to Congress so that the proper functioning of 

the president is protected.  And I believe that 

that value would be operative and is operative

in anything as momentous as charging a former

 president with a crime.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And I would also 

say, I think, and ask you to comment on, you 

know, presidents are concerned about being

 investigated and prosecuted, and it chills to 

some extent their, you know, ability to do what

 they want in office.

 And that's a concern on one side.  But 

can -- can you comment on the concern about 

having a president unbounded while in office, a 

president who knows that he does not have to 

ultimately follow the law because there is 

really nothing more than, say, political 

accountability in terms of -- of impeachment? 

I mean, we have amicus briefs here 

from Professor Lederman, for example, who says, 

you know, a president would not be prohibited by 

statute from perjuring himself under oath about 

official matters, from corruptly altering, 

destroying, or concealing documents to prevent 

them from being used in an official proceeding, 

from suborning others to commit perjury, from

Official 

president in office with the knowledge that they 

have no criminal accountability would do.

 I see that as a concern that is at 

least equal to the president being worried -- so 

worried about criminal prosecution that he, you

 know, is a little bit limited in his ability to

 function.

 So can you talk about those competing

 concerns? 

MR. DREEBEN: So, Justice Jackson, I 

think it would be a sea change to announce a 

sweeping rule of immunity that no president has 

had or has needed. I think we have also had a 

perfectly functioning system that has seen 

occasional episodes of presidential misconduct. 

The Nixon era is the paradigmatic one. The 

indictment in this case alleges another. 

For the most part, I believe that the 

legal regime and the constitutional regime that 

we have works, and to alter it poses more risks. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you. 

MR. DREEBEN: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.
