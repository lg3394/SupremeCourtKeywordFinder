 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument next in Case 23-146, Connelly versus

 United States.

 Mr. Shanmugam.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

To ensure continuity in their 

operations, closely held corporations will often 

agree to redeem the stock of a shareholder upon 

his death and then obtain a life insurance 

policy on the shareholder in order to fund the 

redemption obligation. 

This case presents the question of how 

the federal estate tax treats such arrangements. 

Because the proceeds from a life insurance 

policy to fulfill a contractual redemption 

obligation do not increase the corporation's net 

worth, they do not increase the estate tax owed 

on the decedent's stock.  The court of appeals' 

contrary conclusion was erroneous. 

The legal framework governing this

case is relatively straightforward.  The

 Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations 

provide that where the parties agree on the

 price to redeem a shareholder's stock, that 

price will establish the value of the stock for

 purposes of the estate tax in certain

 circumstances.

 But where, as here, those

 circumstances have not been met, the value of 

the stock is determined by the price at which 

such stock would change hands between a 

hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller. 

Here, a hypothetical buyer would not 

treat the life insurance proceeds as increasing 

the value of the stock because that asset is 

offset by the contractual obligation to redeem 

shares, a preexisting corporate liability. 

Now the government argues that a court 

should attach no weight to the redemption 

obligation when assessing the value of the 

company.  But the government fails to 

distinguish between a contractual obligation to 

redeem stock on the one hand and a voluntary 

stock redemption on the other. 

A hypothetical buyer would treat the

 contractual redemption obligation like any other

 debt that reduces the net worth and therefore

 the value of the company.  The government's 

approach would lead to a grossly inflated 

valuation of the decedent's shares, and it would 

effectively lead to double taxation. It would 

defy common sense to take one side of the 

transaction into account but to ignore the other 

for purposes of the estate tax. And it would 

destroy a valuable succession planning tool that 

the nation's small businesses have openly used 

for decades.  The judgment of the court of 

appeals should be reversed. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Shanmugam, the --

if a very interested buyer showed up the day 

after Michael died, would Thomas sell the 

business to him for 3.86 million? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, if Thomas were the 

person we were thinking about and not Michael, I 

think it is quite possible that a hypothetical 

willing buyer would pay $3.68 million --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, I'm -- I'm -- I'm 

-- I'm more focused on the asking price. If a 

buyer showed up the day after Michael died and

MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, except for the 

fact that, under the buy-sell agreement, Thomas 

is actually disabled from selling the property. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, he has the

option.  That is correct.  But, under the terms

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. Let's --

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So the way --

           JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let me just

 blink that for a minute, okay?  What would he

 ask for it, assuming he could sell it? Would he 

ask 3.86 million or 6.86 million, assuming that

 the insurance was in -- was included in the

 assets or liabilities of the company? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Sure, Justice Thomas. 

So the first question is what is the net worth 

of the company, because we're in agreement with 

the government that that is the first question. 

Our view is that the net worth of the 

company throughout all of this is $3.86 million. 

The government's view is that the net worth of 

the company is $6.86 million because, in the 

government's view, you take into account the 

life insurance proceeds but not the offsetting 

redemption obligation. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So, if a willing 

buyer shows up -- and who owns the life 

insurance policy? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So the company is 

entitled to the proceeds of the life insurance.

And that is hugely important when you're 

applying this test because the fundamental

 problem with the government's view -- our view 

is that 77 percent of $3.86 million is $3

 million.  The government's view is that 

77 percent of $6.86 million is $5.3 million.

 A willing buyer would never, at that 

moment, if buying Michael, the decedent's,

 shares, pay $5.3 million.  Why?  Because a 

willing buyer would not be able to capture those 

life insurance proceeds by swooping in before 

the redemption.  Those life insurance proceeds 

belong to the company. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the value has 

to go someplace.  The 3 million goes someplace. 

Does it go into the value of the remaining 

stocks?  And if it is there, why isn't the 

appropriate valuation 6.86 million? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  The $3 million of the 

life insurance proceeds are used to redeem 

Michael's shares under the terms of the parties' 

agreement. 

Now, as a practical matter, the 

problem here and the fundamental issue that all 

of us are wrestling with is that what we know is

that you can't use the $3 million as simply the

 valuation.  Why?  Because, as I noted at the

 outset, we didn't satisfy the requirements of

 Section 2703.

 And, therefore, you have to engage in 

this counterfactual inquiry, and the problem 

with the counterfactual inquiry that the

 government wants this Court to engage in is, 

again, that it requires you to disregard the 

redemption obligation. 

Now it is true that one consequence of 

our interpretation is that, as to Thomas, the 

surviving stockholder, Thomas in some very real 

sense benefits from the increase in value by 

virtue of this transaction.  Why?  Because 

Thomas goes from having 22 percent of the 

company to a hundred percent of the company. 

But, under our approach, as under the 

government's approach, that is taken care of by 

the eventual application of the capital gains 

tax. 

What the government wants you to do is 

to effectively take those life insurance 

proceeds into account twice, once when 

calculating the estate tax because the

government wants you to tax this higher amount,

 $5.3 million -- and, again, no hypothetical

 willing buyer would ever have paid that.  Crown

 would never have redeemed the shares for $5.3 

million. And I'm happy to explain why.

 But then the government also will

 subject Thomas eventually to the capital gains 

tax on the increase in the value of his shares.

 And that, in our view, is the fundamental 

problem with the government's approach here, and 

that is why this is effectively double taxation. 

And to just spell out for another

stop you there because it seems that the 

fundamental problem with your approach is that 

Thomas's -- the -- you know, Thomas's asset has 

quadrupled in value, and it's quadrupled in 

value without him putting a single cent more 

into the company. 

And there might be some taxation 

effect in the end of all that, but -- but not 

sufficient to -- you know, to -- to make up for

 thing is wrong that somebody can come away with 

four times the value without putting a single

 cent into the company.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, with respect, 

Justice Kagan, I completely disagree with that, 

and let me explain why.

 It is true that Thomas is in a very 

real sense practically the beneficiary of the 

life insurance proceeds.  Why?  Because those 

proceeds extinguish the offsetting liability on 

the books, the offsetting redemption obligation. 

And so this is a context in which 

Thomas does come away with the benefit of those 

proceeds because he is the sole owner of a 

company that is worth $3.86 million. 

Now the government complains around 

the edges about the fact that it's the capital 

gains tax, the capital gains tax only operates 

upon realization, there is a stepped-up basis 

when someone dies and passes the stock along and 

so forth. 

But those are all features of the 

capital gains tax system. That is not a bug 

with our position.  Again, our position is the

rational one precisely because the tax system

 captures that increase.

 And, of course, under our approach, 

Michael's heir is still, of course, paying the 

estate tax. Michael's heir is paying the estate

 tax at -- on stock at around $3 million, 

coincidentally roughly the amount that was

 contained in the buy-sell agreement, which I 

think confirms that that amount was a rational 

amount here. 

But the problem with the $5.3 million, 

again, the government's view is -- let's take 

Crown. The government's view is presumably that 

if there had been a proper arm's-length 

agreement here, Crown would have been willing to 

pay $5.3 million to redeem this stock. 

That would have required Crown to use 

all of the life insurance proceeds here, the 

entire $3.5 million, and also to dip into its 

operating assets in order to redeem those 

shares.  That illustrates why the government's 

position here is irrational. 

Now, to be sure, I think there is a --

I think that that hypothetical which the 

government uses actually helps our position, and 

let me explain why. 

The government acknowledges that if 

you had a situation in which the individuals 

themselves took out the insurance policies and 

entered into a cross-purchase agreement, that it 

would be subject to tax treatment along the 

lines of what we are suggesting here. 

Why should this situation be treated 

differently?  And -- and one reason

 parenthetically why that alternative is 

impractical is that if you have a company with 

multiple owners, that gets very complicated, but

 it's also distinguishable because, in that 

situation, the individuals have to pay the

 premiums.

 Here, the reason why the corporation

 is paying the premiums is precisely because the

 corporation derives a benefit from this 

arrangement, and that benefit, as I said in my 

very first words, is continuity of ownership. 

That is an incredibly valuable benefit to 

closely-held corporations in this context. 

And -- and so this is not a situation 

in which the corporation itself derives any sort 

of windfall.  The corporation is paying premiums 

and it gets the life insurance proceeds in 

return. 

I think what the government is really 

bridling against --

think, but regardless of how he asked it, I 

think that would be one way to consider it, like 

what was the whole value worth.

 Or do we ask, if you had a stranger to

 the situation, what would the price of one share

 be? Is that the right way to think about it? 

And then just kind of to build on to that, do 

you assume the perspective of Thomas, you know,

someone who would buy one of Michael's shares or

 Now that will not always be true.

 There may be circumstances in which, for 

instance, that block of shares gives you a

 control premium that needs to be valued.  And 

when you look at the lower court case law in 

this area, often the price will then be adjusted 

up or down. 

But we're all in agreement that 

there's no such adjustment here. And so, 

really, the fundamental question here is what 

was the net worth of the company.  And to make 

just two additional points about that, the first 

is the reason why we're talking about a 

hypothetical block of 77.18 percent of the 

shares is precisely because, if we were talking 

about Michael's actual shares, those shares are 

about to be extinguished. 

They're subject to the redemption 

obligation.  So I think there's really no good 

conceptual way to do that. And I think that the

regulations recognize that when they talk about 

the fact in 20.2031-1(b) that you can look to an 

equivalent asset, a comparable item in the words 

of the regulation, when you're making this

 determination.

 And then I think the second thing that 

I think is important to keep in mind here is, 

that when you're talking about the net worth of 

the company, I don't really hear the government 

to dispute the fact that an obligation to redeem 

shares would be treated ordinarily -- and common 

sense bears this out -- as a liability like any 

other. 

It's a legally-binding obligation. 

The accounting standards treat it as a 

liability.  In fact, the accounting standards go 

so far as to specifically enumerate stock to be 

redeemed upon the death of the holder as giving 

rise to a liability. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So -- so fair enough 

on that, but it -- it just see if I've got this 

right, and tell me where I'm wrong. 

You agree that the -- the relevant 

value is of the corporation as a whole. And, 

really, the question is what do we do with the

$3 million in life insurance proceeds, how 

should that be dealt with.

 And I hear the government saying a

 prospective buyer would consider that part of 

the assets of the corporation, and, therefore, 

it enhances the value of the company to five

 point whatever it is. And I hear you saying no, 

you really shouldn't count those insurance

 proceeds because they're -- they're earmarked 

for the redemption, and so no willing purchaser 

would account for them in part of his assessment 

of the value of the company. 

Is that a fair assessment of the 

difference between the two? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I would word the point 

slightly differently, Justice Gorsuch, but I 

think this difference is important.  We're not 

disputing that the life insurance proceeds are 

an asset.  What we're really debating here is 

whether or not they are a net asset, whether --

buyer would consider them part of the value of

they're really earmarked for redemption.

buyer I -- would do, I think, is to look at this 

and to say: Yes, there are $3 million in life 

insurance proceeds that are going to come into 

the company, but those proceeds are going to

 immediately go out again.  They're going to go 

out in order to fund this offsetting liability

 which is on the books.

 And under our approach, which, again, 

I think accords with a healthy dose of common 

sense here, when the parties entered into the 

initial buy-sell agreement, that had the effect 

of putting an asset and a liability on the books 

at the same time. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It offset one 

another. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  They offset each other 

at every point. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Now --

MR. SHANMUGAM:  And that is precisely 

why, as I said, in response to one of the 

earlier questions, under our approach, the net 

worth of the company is the same throughout.  In 

other words, it's the same before death, it's 

the same at the moment of death, and it's the 

same after the redemption obligation.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Now one wrinkle to

 that, though, is I -- I don't think the life

 insurance proceeds -- the only permitted use for 

them was the redemption, and the government

 makes something of that.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct, and 

that's why I didn't pick up on the word 

"earmarked" in your question --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right.  Right. And

MR. SHANMUGAM:  And so I think our

non-operating asset. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It's still a $3 

million liability. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  It would still be 

offset.  And, indeed, in this case, the life 

insurance policy was not for $3 million.  It 

turns out it was for $3.5 million.  We're in all

 And so all we are doing here, I think, 

is giving effect to the broader framework which

 not just Congress but the Treasury and the IRS 

has set up here, which is a framework that says

 that when you are in the hypothetical world

 conducting this analysis, you assume that the 

hypothetical buyer and seller takes all relevant

 facts into account.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  And -- and -- and I 

think that the problem with the government's 

approach is that the government's approach 

requires you to do one of two things:  either to 

disregard the offsetting liability or to assume 

-- and I think, when you look at the 

government's italicized hypotheticals, all of 

them effectively do this -- to assume that your 

hypothetical buyer is somehow going to be able 

to capture the life insurance proceeds.

 posited a situation where you had a buyer not 

just of the 77 percent of the shares but of the

 entirety of the company.  Of course, if a buyer

 could get their hands on both Michael's shares

 and Thomas's shares, presumably, the first thing 

that buyer would do is to extinguish any 

redemption obligation, not that that redemption

 obligation would make any sense in that

 hypothetical, and to have the benefit of the

million in life insurance proceeds.

 shares, at that point, it is true that you are

 going to have a diminution in the net worth,

 which ensures that the remaining shareholders'

 stock remains relatively constant.

 That actually turns out not to be true 

when you're dealing with publicly held companies 

because often the stock will move up or down in 

response to such an announcement, but I think 

that basic principle is one that we don't 

disagree with. 

But everything in the government's 

brief presupposes that a voluntary redemption 

and a contractual obligation to redeem shares 

are treated exactly the same way. And I think 

the problem is that if you're a hypothetical 

buyer looking at the company, a redemption 

obligation is like any other debt.  You see that 

on the corporate books.  And that is $3 million 

that is going out the door. 

Now, to be sure, this is a 

hypothetical buyer, and so we are presupposing 

that the buyer is not attempting to buy the 

shares that are subject to the redemption 

obligation.  That would, again, be impossible 

under the terms of the buy-sell agreement, and

 Professor Hellwig's amicus briefs, obviously,

 they've spent a lot of time thinking about this

 issue. They're against you.  Do you want to --

 maybe you just covered it in your view, but 

where do they get it wrong?  Maybe your point is 

the voluntary redemption is where they -- where 

they get it wrong, but I'd like some more 

explanation because they -- they clearly have 

studied this. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I -- I -- I think that 

that is -- the fundamental flaw is that they 

really presuppose a voluntary redemption, and so 

many of the principles that they set out and, 

indeed, the four principles that the government 

sets out are principles that we have no 

objection to in that context. 

In this context, by contrast, again, 

it's that a hypothetical buyer would not somehow 

disregard this redemption obligation.  The 

hypothetical buyer would take it into account

 are going out the door again.

 And to be clear, this results in no 

windfall whatsoever to anyone other than the 

benefit to Thomas that's going to be taxed.

 I think, when the government says that

 the purposes here are not legitimate, there's 

nothing in the case that we disagree with more.

 The reason that closely-held corporations engage 

in these transactions, as the Chamber's amicus 

brief explains at some length, is precisely 

because this is a way of ensuring continuity of 

operations without engaging in disruption. 

If you don't have the life insurance 

proceeds here, most of these companies, which 

are typically very small, are going to have to 

dip into operating assets or otherwise engage in 

some sort of transaction to ensure continuity. 

If you have an heir who doesn't want to run the 

company or if the heir is someone outside the 

family, you have a very real risk that that 

person will not be interested in running the 

company or that you'll have a disruption of 

operations.

just ask you -- because I'm trying to follow. 

So you've said many times that the money is 

going out, but I guess I'm trying to figure out 

whether the proceeds of the life insurance are 

really going out when they're being used to

 redeem the shares.

 So what -- what is the effect on the

 value of the remaining shares once the

 redemption occurs? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So the remaining 

shares effectively have a larger share of 

ownership in the company.  In other words --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Their value 

increases.  Is that where the four times that 

Justice -- Justice Kagan was talking about -- is 

that where that comes from? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that's correct. 

And this is the contrast, I think, with a 

voluntary redemption because, in the context of 

a voluntary redemption, rather than these life 

insurance proceeds, something else has to go out 

of the company and you are getting the shares 

back into the company. 

And -- and the reason why that is 

different is that, here, you are extinguishing

different, is that you have a --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're treating

 this --

MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- liability on the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- you're treating 

this redemption obligation like any other

 redemption obligation, and it's really not like 

any other redemption obligation because this 

obligation is benefiting the equity interests 

that we're trying to value.  And so it -- it --

it just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense in 

that context to say that the redemption 

obligation simultaneously serves to reduce the 

value of that interest. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think that that's a 

fair factual statement, but let me explain to 

you why that should make no difference. 

In our view, the -- the redemption 

obligation is like any other debt from the 

perspective of the hypothetical buyer.  And I 

recognize that this is the artificiality of the 

case, but I think it's an artificiality of the 

case that is inherent in the way that the

regulations work, and I think it's a problem 

that the government has to come to terms with as

 well.

 Our view is that from the perspective

 of a hypothetical third party, the fact that 

this redemption obligation runs to somebody else 

is of no moment. The hypothetical buyer here is 

not in the same position as Michael. It's a

 hypothetical buyer. 

And so that is why we think that when 

you're applying a regulation that requires you 

to take into account all relevant facts, you've 

got to look at the economic reality from the 

position of the company. 

And, again, the best way I think to 

understand that is to think about whether or not 

the government's fair market valuation would be 

one that the parties would use. We know that 

our fair market valuation, in fact, pretty 

closely tracks the price that was agreed.  Five 

point three million dollars would have destroyed 

Crown if Crown had spent that amount of money to 

redeem the shares because, again, the life 

insurance proceeds would not have covered that 

amount.  And I think that that illustrates why

What, if anything, about your

obligation to redeem shares actually has a 

depressive effect on the company's future

 earning capacity.  Why? Precisely because the 

company has to use other assets and typically 

operating assets in order to fund the redemption

 obligation.

 And in that circumstance, there could 

well be a depressive effect on the valuation, 

and that depressive effect could, in fact, be 

substantial. One reason why this circumstance 

is different is precisely because, where you 

have an offsetting life insurance policy and 

redemption obligation, it actually makes sense 

to think about valuation in terms of the net 

worth of the company. 

I think, once you start to get away 

from that, the valuation of the company is 

affected by its remaining operating assets, how 

the business is going to do on a going-forward 

basis. But, here, precisely because there's no 

effect on the remainder of the company, it makes 

sense to engage in the valuation by multiplying 

the percentage of shares by the net worth.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF YAIRA DUBIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. DUBIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 it please the Court: 

The estate's evaluation of Michael 

Connelly's shares contradicts basic math and 

valuation principles.  According to the estate, 

before we can value Michael's shares in Crown, 

we must first subtract the price that Crown paid 

for Michael's shares.  In other words, the 

estate's theory is that before you can value 

something, you must first subtract the price 

paid for the very thing you are trying to value. 

That makes no sense.  Using the item 

you're trying to value as a line item in its own 

valuation will never give you the correct 

answer, and it doesn't give the estate the right 

answer here either. 

The estate's contrary view rests on a 

fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of a 

redemption obligation.  A redemption obligation 

is not a corporate debt that reduces the

corporation's net worth or the value of the

 shares to be redeemed.  A debt owed to creditors

 reduces corporate and shareholder value.  A

 redemption obligation divides the corporate pie 

among existing shareholders without changing the

 value of their interests.

 And, here, the corporate pie was worth

 6.86 million, not 3.86 million.  And that's true 

even if you look only at the estate's own 

numbers.  Petitioner admits that Michael's 

estate walked away from the redemption with 

approximately $3 million in cash, but Petitioner 

also admits that Thomas walked away from the 

redemption with $3.86 million in value. 

And the estate doesn't dispute the 

black-letter valuation principle that the 

interest of each equity shareholder added 

together has to equal the -- company's total 

value. That defeats their position because that 

means that Crown's total net worth before the 

family divided the company was 6.86 million, the 

value of the two equity slices put back 

together, and that means that the estate's 

valuation of Michael's 77 percent stake in Crown 

at $3 million came nowhere close to fair market

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think what

 Petitioner is arguing is that, yes, we took the

 insurance policy, the receipts, 3.5 million, we 

paid out 3, and we received the shares, so it's

 a wash.  The 3 million, up -- up to 3 million, 

is a wash. So what do you do with that

 argument? 

MS. DUBIN: Sure.  So that argument 

depends on the idea that the $3 million 

redemption obligation is a debt, a liability, 

and that's just not correct. 

What it is is a promise to cash out 

one of the existing shareholders' shares.  So, 

for example, in the two sisters hypothetical, on 

page 27 of our brief, if you own 80 percent of a 

company worth $5 million, you have a $4 million 

stake in the company, a redemption obligation at 

fair market value would be a promise to cash you 

out for your shares for your stake in the 

company. 

It is not the same thing as the 

corporation, for example, owing a mortgage or 

some other debt.  A mortgage or some other debt

like that would reduce the value of the company

 and the value of -- for its shareholders.  That 

is simply just not true of a redemption

 obligation.

 And I think that, you know, it's sort 

of important that Petitioner concedes that a

 voluntary redemption obligation wouldn't

 decrease the value of the company because, on 

the date of Michael's death, it doesn't matter 

whether the redemption obligation is voluntary 

or mandatory. 

Three million dollars is being paid to 

Michael's shares, so that's where that money is 

going. But it is going either whether that's 

voluntary or mandatory.  The point is that that 

was part of the corporate assets here and it was 

paid to Michael on the date of his death. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Do you agree that 

none of the money escapes taxation because more 

value -- I mean, the -- the $3 million of the 

life insurance proceeds didn't vanish.  As you 

say, it's -- it's retained by the company, and 

Mr. Shanmugam was pointing out that Thomas will 

be taxed on that as a capital gains tax when he 

sells out his shares.  So Mr. Shanmugam says

that means that the government is double

 dipping. 

What do you have to say to that?

 MS. DUBIN: A couple responses to

 that. First of all, any sort of double dipping

 allegation comes from the Connelly family's

 decisions to value the shares at below fair 

market value. Had these shares been redeemed 

for fair market value, which is $5.3 million, 

there would be no risk of double taxation.  The 

risk of double taxation comes because $2.3 

million stayed in Crown and inured to Thomas's 

benefit, but that money was really part of the 

fair market value of Michael's shares. 

In a normal -- in a transaction that 

was done at fair market value, you would have 

had 5.3 million go to Michael's estate, be 

subject to the estate tax, and never be subject 

to any possibility of future taxation through 

capital gains on Thomas.  So that's the first 

answer, which is this problem comes because the 

estate valued these shares below fair market 

value. 

But the second answer is that we just 

simply can't know what will happen to Thomas's

shares in the future.  Maybe they will be 

subject to capital gains. It depends if he

 bequeaths them.  It depends what they're worth

 at that time.  That's a separate inquiry that 

goes to the value of Thomas. The estate tax

 cares about the value of Michael's shares at the 

time of Michael's death and Michael's estate, 

not what went to any of the particular heirs or

 beneficiaries. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought -- am I 

wrong that on -- on capital gains you pay the 

tax when you -- capital gain at the -- at the 

price that it's -- you've gotten it? 

MS. DUBIN: If -- if you get a 

stepped-up basis. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's why he 

won't pay on that. 

MS. DUBIN: If he sells it during his 

lifetime --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

MS. DUBIN: -- he didn't get these 

shares as a bequeathment, so he's not entitled 

to stepped-up basis, but he could pass it on to 

his heirs with a stepped-up basis. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The net worth 

question that Mr. Shanmugam said the net worth 

stayed the same all the way through, A, do you 

agree? B, why is that not relevant if it is

 true?

 MS. DUBIN: It's not true.  The 

corporation was worth 6.86 million on the date

 of Michael's death.  Our view is not that only 

somehow Michael's shares had some value in them 

that the corporation didn't have.  Our view is 

that the corporation's equity value is made up 

by the equity stakeholder's value.  Michael's 

shares were entitled to a $5.3 million valuation 

and Thomas's shares were a $1.5 million 

valuation.  That adds up to our $6.86 million 

valuation. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why -- why is it 

-- you said the redemption obligation is not a 

debt. Just walk me through that if you can, 

because I find this case extremely difficult. 

So it seems like a key point and I'd like to

 the extent we're --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But he's saying

 that's the key point in the case. I think

 that's what he said.  So I'd like to hear you

 address that.

 MS. DUBIN: Yeah.  And I think that --

I think -- we've been talking a little bit about 

the amicus briefs and they are very helpful in 

explaining just the nature of a redemption 

generally, but the nature of a redemption, what 

a company is agreeing to do in a redemption is 

to exchange one of the existing shareholders' 

shares, so their stake in the company, their 

equity stake in the company, in exchange for 

cash. 

So that's -- that's the promise.  It's 

we will get back your equity shares and we will 

give you cash in exchange for it.  If that were 

done at fair market value, it would mean that if 

you had an 80 percent stake in a $5 million 

company, you would be entitled to $4 million in 

cash.

What happens on the other side, your 

shares are extinguished, so they no longer 

exist. So the remaining shareholder, who was a

 20 percent stakeholder in our $5 million 

company, he had originally, to start, he had a 

20 percent stake in a $5 million company, which

 is a $1 million stake.  Now, after this 

redemption which is paid out at $4 million, he

 would be left with sole ownership of a $1 

million company. 

So, in a redemption, both of the 

corporate shareholders, if the redemption is 

done at fair market value, they both walk away 

with the same value they had before.  By 

contrast, in a debt situation where you're 

paying a debt, the corporation pays money out of 

its coffers to someone outside the corporation 

and that will reduce both the corporate and the 

shareholder value, and if this had been that 

sort of $3 million debt, then Petitioner's 

analysis would be right, but, here, the $3 

million went into Michael's pocket, it went to 

one of the equity shareholders.  So that does 

not -- decrease the value of the corporation or, 

of course, the value of the shares to be

 And I think just to pause on that for

 a second, you know, Petitioner says what we're 

really valuing here is some theoretical stake in

 the corporation, not Michael's shares.  That's 

not correct as a matter of the statute. The 

statute tells us in 26 U.S.C. 2031, 2033, and

 2036 that the relevant shares to be valued here

 are the decedent's shares.  That's, of course, 

what we're valuing.  So that's not correct. 

But, even if you were going to value 

some hypothetical 77 percent stake in the 

company, some 70 percent seven -- 77 percent 

stake in the company with a redemption 

obligation or anything like that, you would 

always get $5.3 million because $5.3 million is 

what that stake is equivalent to. 

The only way you get Petitioner's 

numbers is if you treat it as if there's a 

separate $3 million debt that you first take out 

of the company and then you try to value 

Michael's shares.  But that just doesn't make 

sense because that $3 million runs to the holder 

of Michael's shares.  It is not some 

free-floating debt out there in the universe.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it would work if 

-- Petitioner's would work if it was a

 free-floating debt somewhere outside in the

 universe?

 MS. DUBIN:  Yes.  If it were a debt 

owed to creditors just generally when you're 

doing a very simplistic valuation of a 

corporation, you would subtract the liabilities 

owed to creditors before you determine what is 

the equity value remaining. 

But, here, we're looking at an equity 

stake and money paid to an equity stake, and you 

can't say that that reduces the value of that 

equity stake or the value of the corporation as 

a whole. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Would your answer 

differ if the life insurance proceeds had been 

earmarked for the redemption of Michael's 

shares? 

MS. DUBIN: No. The parties' intent 

doesn't govern here.  I think both we and 

Petitioner agree that the $3 million is actually 

an asset to the corporation.  It does count. 

And we both agree on that. The only question is 

whether it's offset by a debt, offset by a

I think it doesn't matter.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, help -- help 

me on that because I understand a hypothetical

 purchaser of the company of -- as a whole would 

say: Ah, that $3 million is going to inure to 

my benefit because I'm just going to extinguish

 the redemption obligation and off we go.

 But, if somebody's purchasing 

Michael's shares at the time of his death, why 

-- why isn't it different then and -- and --

because we're assessing his estate value, and 

there you have an obligation to pay him out and 

the insurance proceeds coming in to do that. 

MS. DUBIN: Absolutely.  And the 

answer is that for all of the illustrations that 

we've suggested, whether it's a buyer of Crown 

as a whole, whether it's a buyer of just 

Michael's shares, you will always be able to 

capture the value of the insurance proceeds. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  But you agree 

the relevant measure is the buyer of Michael's 

shares?

Petitioner mentioned, we agree that it's a pro

rata share of Crown as a whole, so you will get 

the same number whether you value a buyer of 

Crown as a whole and then take Michael's pro

 rata share of that or value just Michael's

 shares.  Either way, a buyer who just buys

 Michael's shares is going to get a 77 percent 

stake in a company with total assets of $6.86

 million.  So, if that redemption obligation now 

runs to him, he will get cash in exchange for 

the 77 percent obligation.  If the redemption 

obligation is for some reason not honored or 

whatever it is, then he has a 77 percent stake 

in a company worth $6.86 million. 

But what -- the problem with 

Petitioner's case is that he tries to take $3 

million out of that pot. But the problem is 

that that $3 million goes to the holder of 

Michael's shares. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Feel free to tell 

me this is the wrong question, but what's the 

net worth of the company after the shares are 

redeemed?

$3.86 million, and you see this in the pie

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, how about on

 your view?

 MS. DUBIN: On our view, had the 

redemption been done at fair market value, which 

it was not, had the redemption been done at fair

 market value, it would be 1.53 million.

 But I think that that picks up on a

 critical point, which is our -- our view, the 

government's view, here about how the estate tax 

works doesn't change how the parties had to 

structure their transactions.  They are free to 

redeem shares at below fair market value for 

whatever business or idiosyncratic reasons they 

want to.  But the estate tax looks at what was 

the fair market value of those shares. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So, after they get 

the life insurance proceeds and redeem the 

shares, the net worth of the company's dropped 

dramatically in your estimation? 

MS. DUBIN: Yes.  And that's the 

fundamental way when you're --

seem that -- just explain that to me.

goes a little bit to your questions earlier

 about how a redemption is supposed to work.

 A redemption is a -- essentially, it's

 sort of like a spinoff, right?  You're dividing

 the corporate assets among existing

 shareholders.  One is getting cash in exchange 

for their share, and one gets sole ownership of

 a company worth less. 

It is a problem for Petitioner that 

notwithstanding that that's how a redemption is 

supposed to work in his view, the corporation 

maintains the same amount before and after.  And 

the reason that the problem comes from is 

because he's saying the corporation is worth 

$3.86 million before, but it's actually worth 

6.86 million. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think it's odd 

that you have a net worth of the company --

what's the net worth of the company in your view 

-- the day before he dies? 

MS. DUBIN: So just -- I don't -- I 

don't mean to pause, but the trickiness of it is 

trying to value the life insurance policies the 

day before he dies.  There's a cash surrender 

value of the life insurance policies, which is

approximately $500,000 the day before Michael

 dies. So that's a little bit tricky.

 But putting aside any interest in the 

life insurance policies whatsoever, it's around

 $3 million.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And then,

 after he dies, even though they've bought the 

life insurance for exactly this purpose, the net 

worth of the company has dipped in half, right? 

MS. DUBIN: So two --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: That seems a 

little -- I mean, maybe you say they just messed 

up, but that -- the whole purpose of the life 

insurance policy was to make sure that didn't 

happen, right? 

MS. DUBIN: So two responses to that. 

On the first point, if you're only looking at 

Crown, it is correct that after the redemption, 

Crown becomes a smaller company. That's how 

redemptions work.  But, if you're looking at the 

total value that the Connelly family walked away 

with, they are going to walk away with a total 

of $6.86 million.  Some of it was used to buy 

out Crown -- buy out Michael, and some of it was 

used to Crown.

 want --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The whole family

 mean -- and Thomas got out of this -- well, I 

think, but I'm not sure why the company's net 

worth should dip in half when the whole purpose 

of getting the life insurance policy, I think, I 

-- you've probably already answered this, but

 the life insurance policy was meant to prevent 

that, I thought. 

MS. DUBIN: I think that -- my 

understanding is that is what the parties 

intended.  Intent doesn't govern here. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I -- I got it, but 

it's weird to walk away the day after his death 

with a company that's suddenly worth 50 percent 

of what it had been worth the day before his 

death, even though you bought a life insurance 

policy to cover the redemption. 

MS. DUBIN: Yeah.  So two -- two 

responses to that.  One is it's really not 

strange in the concept of what a redemption is. 

That is what a redemption is supposed to do.  A 

redemption is supposed to give one shareholder 

cash in exchange for their assets, and the other

you're right, what the parties wanted to do here 

was maintain Crown as a $3.86 million enterprise 

and give Michael $3 million. That's what the

 parties wanted.  That means that there's $6.86 

million of value in the estate tax because 

Michael owned that $6.86 million of value.  His 

percentage stake of it says that was the fair 

value -- market value of Michael's shares. 

I think that sort of pulls up, you 

know, Petitioner's points about -- continuity of 

ownership.  There are many ways in which to 

arrange for continuity of ownership of a 

closely-held corporation, but what you can't do 

is have $6.86 million of corporate assets by 

virtue of a life insurance proceed, take $3 

million out and give it to one shareholder, 

maintain the company at its $3.86 million size, 

and then maintain for purposes of the estate tax 

that the company wasn't worth $6.86 million.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm sorry, Chief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you dispute

 your friend's statements that this is been a 

common way for family corporations to maintain

 continuity of operations?  And is -- if -- if 

that's the case, how -- how long has the

 government overlooked the fact that there was 

this great pool of money out there waiting for

 them to take? 

MS. DUBIN: Sure.  So our 

understanding is not Petitioner's understanding. 

This is what we know, and I'll -- I'll tell you 

what we know, which is there have only been 

these three reported cases that we know of. So 

it's Blount and Cartwright from 1999 and 2005 

and then this case.  That's it.  So, in terms of 

the litigated cases, not very many. 

We did ask at the cert stage the IRS 

examiners who are charged with looking at estate 

tax returns if they're seeing a lot of these in 

the pipeline, and they are not.  They couldn't 

find any.  So they didn't see any sort of 

maneuvers like this in the fact patterns in what 

they are looking at. 

I understand that that's not, you

people are doing it or not. My guess is that --

or my view is what should have been happening is

 that tax advisors are looking at what you have 

on the one hand is the Ninth and Eleventh 

Circuit extremely thinly reasoned decisions on 

this, and on the other hand, what you have is 

the Tax Court's decision in Blount I, and the 

Tax Court's decision in Blount I explains 

extremely clearly that this doesn't make sense 

because you are, you know, subtracting the value 

of the very thing you're trying to price in 

determining the value of that thing.

 happening often, it was probably happening in

 the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, which, of

 course, this case doesn't arise from.  This

 comes from the Eighth Circuit.  And that -- that 

might be one way that advisors are saying they 

can do it in those circuits.

 Tax advisors tend to be risk averse. 

I think they would be very well aware of the

 fact that there are other ways to structure 

this, like the cross-insurance agreement or held 

by a trust or various ways in which the critical 

piece is that the life insurance proceeds do not 

go into the corporation, because the premise of 

Blount and Cartwright, the court of appeals 

decisions, is that somehow you can have money 

come into a corporation and have it not count 

when you're valuing shares in the corporation. 

And there's no reasoning whatsoever to 

explain why they think it's appropriate to treat 

the redemption --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

MS. DUBIN: -- obligation as a 

liability.

might think it's appropriate because the money

that comes in goes out fairly quickly.

 MS. DUBIN: I agree that's definitely 

the sort of initial appeal of what Petitioner is 

saying and what the courts must have thought was 

true in Blount and Cartwright. It's simply just

 not correct, though, because the going out

 matters.  If it's going out to a creditor, it

 reduces the corporation's net worth, and it

 would reduce the shareholders' values.  We 

absolutely agree with that. 

But, here, when it went out, it went 

out to the holder of Michael's equity stake. 

Michael has a stake, and we are cashing out his 

shares.  That's what's happening there.  So it's 

not something that reduces the value of the 

shareholders' shares.  It would not reduce the 

value of Michael's shares, and it wouldn't 

reduce Crown's net worth when we're looking at 

it. It's not a debt owed to creditors.  It is a 

promise to exchange a shareholder's shares for 

cash. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, if the IRS doesn't 

see many people doing this, what are they 

seeing?  What do families do instead?

much more common to do the cross-purchase 

arrangement so you keep -- right.  The two

 brothers would cross-insure each other.  The 

life insurance proceeds would never come into

 the corporation.  And so you have a situation 

where, if Thomas wanted to, he could buy Michael 

out, and that would be a much simpler way of 

accomplishing that, and you wouldn't have this 

problem that we're dealing with here where you 

have corporate assets that Petitioner has to 

argue shouldn't be counted as corporate assets. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the reason 

that's not as attractive is because, in this 

situation, it's the corporation that is paying 

the premiums or --

MS. DUBIN: They're a different --

they're not economically exactly the same 

transactions, of course.  It's not us saying 

that this is, you know, sort of just a 

form-over-substance distinction. That's not 

what's happening here. They're different. 

In the situation that happened here, 

you had Crown paying the premiums, Crown had the 

benefits and burdens of ownership, and that's 

why, in the end, when Crown then gets the

 In the cross-insurance arrangement, it

 would be the brothers personally responsible for

 maintaining those life insurance policies.  And,

 no, there would not be the same confidence from 

one brother to another that you will maintain

 those policies.

 So these -- these different tactics do 

have different economic consequences, but those 

are the choices taxpayers can make as they're 

navigating how can we minimize the estate tax 

consequences of a large estate. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Your position

Ninth or Eleventh, there is no reason for you to 

think that those Ninth and Eleventh Circuit

 precedents are governing. And I do expect that 

tax advisors would know that.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I could just 

sort of put this in most simple -- you know, 

it's a little bit hard for me to get this 

through my head, but your basic pitch is this is 

not any old liability.  This is a redemption 

obligation.  A redemption obligation is supposed 

to split the pie, so you come away with a 

smaller pie.  That's because that's what 

redemption obligations do. 

MS. DUBIN: Yes, that's correct. 

That's our basic pitch about a redemption 

obligation.  I would just add that the other 

part of our pitch is that the hole in their case 

is that they are trying to value Michael's 

shares after Crown already redeemed them. 

You can't do that.  The price paid out 

for Michael's shares is value that goes to 

Michael's shares.  If you subtract that as a $3 

million liability before trying to value 

Michael's shares, you will never get the correct

        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So the gist of the 

government's position is that it is not any old 

obligation.  But that's the fundamental problem 

with the government's position. 

You see, the government doesn't 

dispute the fact that it is a liability in 

common sense or accounting terms.  They say: 

Well, it's a liability that runs to an equity 

holder.  It's a liability that runs to the 

Michael -- to Michael. But the problem here is 

that we're analyzing this from the perspective 

of a hypothetical buyer, not Michael. 

And from the perspective of a 

hypothetical buyer, this is, therefore, like any 

other debt.  The fact that the debt runs to one 

of the other shareholders rather than to the

bank that holds the mortgage is of no moment. 

It is a liability that does not inure to the 

benefit of the hypothetical buyer.

 And so, when valuing the company and 

determining its net worth, you have to look at 

it from the perspective of somebody who is

 examining the entirety of the company and try to

 figure out what he or she would -- pay for that

 share. 

And while it is true that we're trying 

to value Michael's shares, we're not trying to 

value Michael's actual shares because, after 

all, those are the precise shares that are 

subject to the $3 million redemption obligation 

and are going to be extinguished.  That's why 

you have to make the move to a hypothetical 

block of shares in the same proportion. 

Now let's drill down a little bit 

about the basic flaw in the government's 

position.  I think this flaw was illustrated in 

the colloquy between my friend, Ms. Dubin, and 

Justice Kavanaugh, and that is because the 

government's position is not just that Michael's 

shares are worth $5.13 million.  It's that after 

the redemption, the remaining shares, Thomas's

shares, would be worth $1.53 million.

 What does that tell you?  It tells you 

that in order to engage in a redemption at fair 

market value, the company would have to do

 something that it would never do.  This is a

 $3.86 million company that would have to use 

some of that corporate value and some of its 

operating assets in order to redeem the shares 

and thereby diminish the remainder of the 

company and be left with a stub of a company. 

And particularly for a company like 

Crown in an industry like the construction 

industry, where most of the assets are literally 

bricks and mortar inventory, that is something 

that is completely counterfactual and would 

never take place in the real world. 

And, parenthetically, to the extent 

that the government comes back to the fact that 

supposedly under our approach the two sets of 

shares would add up to $6.86 million because 

Thomas's shares would be valued at $3.86 

million, the problem with that is that $3.86 

million is the post-redemption value of Thomas's 

shares. 

Under our approach, as the pie charts

in our reply brief bear out, if you are valuing

 Thomas's shares, those shares would be worth

 only $880,000 at the time of Michael's death

 precisely because what you're trying to do is to

 value the entire company from the perspective of

 a hypothetical buyer. 

Now, to the extent that the government 

says, well, you're getting a benefit here, 

you're getting a $3 million redemption of shares 

and Thomas is walking away with the same company 

that existed beforehand, that is a feature of 

the fact that the company is getting, through 

awards of the life insurance, it is getting $3 

million and that $3 million is being put to use. 

But that is being accounted for by the 

operation of the tax system and, in particular, 

the operation of the capital gains tax. And to 

the extent that Ms. Dubin today in response to 

Justice Sotomayor said:  Well, you may not get 

that money right away, you only get it upon 

realization, you only get the difference between 

the value at the time of realization and the 

value at the time that Thomas acquired the 

shares, all of those are features of the capital 

gains system.

In terms of whether or not this is a 

common practice, that's obviously a hard thing

 to quantify.  I would respectfully submit that 

the number of client alerts and -- and the 

amount of froth in the industry in response to 

the Court's grant of cert suggests that this is

 a pretty common practice. 

But, if we look at the reported cases, 

I think the two critical facts are, first, that 

the government, in fact, took the contrary 

position in Estate of Cartwright, a case where 

the contrary position benefitted the government 

because we were dealing with income tax rather 

than the estate tax; second, that the government 

never indicated its non-acquiescence in those 

decisions as the IRS sometimes does when it 

disagrees with them; and, third, that I think 

it's a little bit unfair to disparage the Ninth 

and the Eleventh Circuits here because it isn't 

as if the Eighth Circuit offered more extended 

reasoning. 

The sum total of the Eighth Circuit's 

reasoning was that if you posited a buyer of the 

entirety of the company, that buyer could 

capture the value of the life insurance

 proceeds.  And, ultimately, that analysis is

 fundamentally flawed.

 And none of the alternative ways of

 attempting to achieve the same result that the

 government posits, in fact, are successful.  I

 think Ms. Dubin actually herself illustrated the

 flaws with individuals cross-purchasing

 insurance in order to conduct this arrangement 

off the corporate books. Individuals could, of 

course, charge their minds.  There would be the 

lack of certainty.  But, fundamentally, the 

corporation would not be paying the premiums, 

and the corporation is the one who benefits from 

continuity of ownership.
