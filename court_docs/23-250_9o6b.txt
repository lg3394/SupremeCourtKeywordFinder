 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-250,

 Becerra versus the Apache Tribe.

 Ms. Flynn.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLINE A. FLYNN

    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. FLYNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The Indian Self-Determination Act 

requires the Indian Health Service to enter into 

contracts with tribes to transfer federal health 

programs that IHS previously carried out for the 

tribes' benefit.  ISDA's basic design is simple. 

IHS takes the appropriated funds it would have 

otherwise spent on the federal program and 

transfers those funds to the tribe in exchange 

for the tribe's promise to use them to provide 

the same level of services, and ISDA obligates 

IHS to add to that core secretarial amount 

contract support costs to plug specific gaps the 

secretarial amount does not cover. 

What the tribes are arguing here is 

that ISDA also obligates IHS to subsidize the 

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official 

tribes' expenditures of funds that they don't 

receive from IHS under the contract but, rather, 

collect from third parties as supplemental

 revenue.

 The statutory text and context refute 

that theory, which would upend how the statute

 has been administered for 35 years.  ISDA's

 provisions addressing contract support costs say

 nothing about third-party revenue a tribe may 

earn. ISDA deals with that separate income 

stream in other provisions, including one 

instructing that such income shall be treated as 

supplemental funding to that in the contract. 

The tribes' argument that Congress 

actually intended for such income to determine 

what IHS pays under the contract would work a 

sea change in ISDA's scheme by potentially 

tripling the federal government's contract 

support cost obligation and eventually 

transforming what the statute designates as mere 

support costs into the primary component of 

contract funding. 

But there is an even more 

straightforward reason why the tribes' theory 

here is wrong.  It violates Congress's express 

Heritage Reporting Corporation

command that IHS only reimburse costs that are 

directly attributable to the tribes' ISDA

 contract.  That prohibition applies

 notwithstanding any other provision of law and 

would independently bar the agency from paying 

the costs at issue here even if they might

 otherwise qualify.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Are there limitations 

on how the tribe can use the outside income --

MS. FLYNN: There are two --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- the additional 

income? 

MS. FLYNN: -- there are two statutory 

conditions that are applicable to how tribes can 

use the -- this third-party reimbursement 

income.  Those are in 5325(m)(1).  That's a 

provision --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And what's that 

limitation? 

MS. FLYNN: So, there, it says they 

have to use it to further the general purposes 

of the contract.  And --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So, if that's the 

case, I guess their argument is then it is a 

Heritage Reporting Corporation

part of the contract?

 MS. FLYNN: They have an argument that

 because all of ISDA 20 -- Title I is 

incorporated via a cross-reference in the 

authority section of the model contract, that --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah.

 MS. FLYNN: -- that provision, (m)(1),

 is incorporated.

 But that provision also has to be read 

consistent with the provision of the Indian 

Health Care Improvement Act. That's 1641(d)(2). 

And that governs the same reimbursement income 

and says tribes just have to use it "for any 

healthcare-related purpose" or otherwise defer 

to the purposes of that law, which include 

things like -- as varied as including the 

presence of tribal members in healthcare 

professions. 

So it is a very open-ended limitation 

that is not limited to just providing additional 

contract services. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, under --

under your approach, a tribe is worse off if the 

-- the more they undertake in the -- in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In terms -- in

 terms of funding, they are undertaking more 

healthcare responsibilities and getting a 

smaller percentage of the money back from the

 government.

 MS. FLYNN: I would respectfully

 disagree with that, Your Honor.  I believe 

you're referencing the -- the mathematical hypo 

that the tribes have offered in their brief 

saying that there is what they call a 

self-determination penalty because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MS. FLYNN: -- for the same amount of 

third-party reimbursement income HHS brings in, 

the tribe won't be able to provide the same 

level of services.  But that assumes that HHS, 

when it's -- or IHS, when it's running its own 

program, and the tribes are earning the same 

amount of third-party income. 

And there are ways that statute has --

or that Congress has built flexibilities into 

the statute to enable tribes to earn more 

third-party reimbursement income in the first

 And so you don't -- there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how is

 that? I mean, they're getting more Medicare,

 Medicaid asset -- or financing that they can

 then use, but the -- under the interpretation of

 the government, they're not reimbursed for that. 

MS. FLYNN: Well, they're earning more 

in the first instance, for instance, because 

tribes running their own programs can 

unilaterally decide to serve non-Indians and 

other noneligible beneficiaries. IHS --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what about the 

tribes that don't want to do that?  I mean, I 

think you said that maybe half the tribes serve 

non-Indians, but the other half don't and, 

presumably, have decided that they don't want 

to. And then the Chief Justice's question would 

apply in full force.  They're getting less 

because they've gone the independence route. 

MS. FLYNN: Well, I -- I think that 

Congress gave them that flexibility so that they 

could grow their programs that way, but the

other ways in which IHS is differently situated 

is that IHS can't use Medicaid and Medicare 

proceeds, which are the bulk of the proceeds 

that we're talking about, to spend on new

 construction of new facilities.  Tribes can. 

That can enable the tribes to grow their 

programs and bring in more third-party income.

 And there's -- the other distinction 

is that because tribes are able to use their 

income on any healthcare-related purpose, 

whereas IHS is subject to a first use 

requirement where they have to specifically 

reinvest that money in Medicaid and Medicare 

program compliance, there's also just a 

limitation on how IHS can build the program, 

even aside from the decision to serve --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is that really 

MS. FLYNN: -- non-beneficiaries. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- so different?  I 

mean, presumably, the tribes also have to make 

sure they're compliant with Medicare and 

Medicaid, so, presumably, they're having to put 

money into the same things.

thought it was a difference when they

 deliberately exempted the tribes from that

 requirement and said that they can prioritize

 other uses of these funds, including program

 expansion, rather than having to ensure complete 

compliance with Medicaid and Medicare in the

 first instance. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I mean --

MS. FLYNN: But I would --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- they have to make 

sure that the Medicare and the Medicaid monies 

keep flowing in, and for them to -- for those 

monies to keep flowing in, they have to be 

compliant with the program terms. 

MS. FLYNN: Right, but they have a 

sort of accounting and prioritization 

flexibility that IHS does not have. 

But the other thing is -- I would say 

about all this is this is -- we're talking now 

about the tribes' argument that there is some 

kind of a contractual condition having to do 

with spending the money that shows that Congress 

would have wanted this to be considered -- to 

help determine contract support costs, but I 

think, when you look at the contract support

with that, then what's the problem here?  You 

raised the specter that they're going to expand

 their programs to help non-Indians.  Maybe

 they're free to do that -- you're right --

 statutorily.

 But, in terms of the contract support 

services that would be required to be paid from

 the government, it would seem to be limited, A, 

as you've agreed, by the general purpose of the

Your Honor on imposing that limitation if you 

were to say that there is some additional

 contract support cost obligation tied to

 third-party reimbursement.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  So would that

MS. FLYNN: I'm talking about the --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- would that take 

care of all the government's concerns about and 

-- and -- and the parade of horribles about the 

money being used for non-Indian healthcare? 

Because it would seem to. 

MS. FLYNN: Well, again, that wasn't 

what the lower court found here, and I don't 

believe that's what the tribes are arguing, but, 

I mean, I think we would still have a situation 

where, because third-party reimbursement income 

has been increasing and because that would then 

directly, according to the tribes' theory, 

determine how much contract support cost the 

agency is paying and that amount would grow and 

snowball over time, it would overtake the

again, of them becoming payors of last resort

 the way IHS sometimes is.  And -- and that is a

 big change.  I grant you that.

 But I think you've just agreed that 

properly read, (m)(1) would limit it to Indian

 healthcare and the particular services the 

government has contracted for the tribes to 

supply. 

MS. FLYNN: So I would agree that the

tribes' theory were adopted or imposed on the 

program nationwide, that would amount to about 

800 million to $2 billion per year.  That would

 non-Indian beneficiaries from the kind of 

contract support costs they're asking for, and

saying, oh, there are all these possible abuses 

out there in the world, that there was a ready 

solution, which was to limit it to the services 

that the tribe is providing to Indians under the 

contract. 

MS. FLYNN: To -- just to clarify, we 

don't think it's an abuse to, you know, take 

advantage of the flexibilities that Congress has 

allowed to decide to serve non-beneficiaries if 

it will not diminish the care available to 

eligible Indians.  But --

 MS. FLYNN: But I understood my friend 

representing the Northern Arapaho to say that if

 the tribe actually does spend third-party

 reimbursement income on program services, that 

that should lead to a different result.

 I don't think that solves the -- the 

problem for his argument there, but I didn't

 take him to be saying that you limit the kind of 

third-party reimbursement income to just that 

provided to Indians.  That is not something I 

have seen raised in this case.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Go ahead.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you've 

been talking about this costing a lot. It may

 well be.  And -- and I'm interested in the other

 side's response to the series of questions that 

are going on now about that limitation.

 But I understand that in terms of

 tribal healthcare, it's about one-third of what 

is spent by the average American on their own 

healthcare.  So it's not as if all of this money 

is bringing us a luxury healthcare spa. It's 

actually bringing us to a fairly minimal level 

of healthcare for tribal members. 

I still don't understand how your 

interpretation makes any contract support system 

costs, or many of them, recoverable at all 

because you seem to be saying that if you --

providing services with a -- you have services 

with a third party like Medicare or Medicaid, 

why would that then include contracts with a 

consultant who comes in to do the other services 

that the contract requires for the government? 

There's always third-party contract --

contract supports that are reimbursed by the 

government.  Why is this any different?  They're

 of their agreement with the government.  This is 

only a reimbursement. It's not a required

 service agreement.

 MS. FLYNN: So I do want to make sure 

to respond to the point that Your Honor raised 

in the beginning of your question about the 

underfunding of Indian health, and IHS, you 

know, agrees with that and is seeking additional 

appropriations from Congress but just doesn't 

believe that upending the funding scheme in this 

way, in an open-ended way, is what --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that 

assumes the answer to the question, which is 

that it's upending, if it's clear by the text 

that if you provide services, you'll be 

reimbursed for them and for contract support. 

It's the contract doing that, not -- not 

upending it. 

MS. FLYNN: Yes, but I -- to respond 

to Your Honor's question about 5326 and the two 

prohibitions there, so you were, I believe, 

referencing the second prohibition, which is 

that IHS funds cannot be spent to pay costs

 We understand that prohibition to be 

limited to contracts by which the tribe receives 

funds, which is consistent with Congress's --

what we understand to be Congress's motivation 

to not have IHS's appropriated funds be used to

 subsidize other funding schemes.

 But, even if you disagree with me 

about that, I would point you to the first 

prohibition in 5326.  That is the one saying 

that IHS's appropriated funds cannot be used to

directly attributable to ISDA contracts.  And we 

think that that language squarely applies here 

because attributable is asking for a causation

It seems to me there's an argument

secretarial amount. Am I right that you don't 

dispute that the costs of collecting the 

Medicare and Medicaid fall within the 

secretarial amount? 

MS. FLYNN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  When IHS 

collects the money, does IHS then spend it? 

MS. FLYNN: Yes.  It has to first 

dedicate it to the facility that earned its 

compliance with Medicaid and Medicare, but yes.

 understand the tribes -- and Mr. Unikowsky can

 address this point -- I don't understand the

 tribes to be saying it should be part of the 

secretarial amount, but if the secretarial

 amount includes the costs of collection, it's 

not apparent to me why it wouldn't cover the 

costs of expenditure in the same way that you're 

saying IHS spends that money. 

MS. FLYNN: Because the -- well, there 

are some -- I'm not sure this is Your Honor's 

question.  There are some overhead 

administrative functions that are included in 

the secretarial amount if they're the kind of 

thing that the Secretary could have allocated to 

that tribe. 

But, no, the costs of spending income 

from third parties is not part of the 

secretarial amount because that is limited to 

the funds the Secretary otherwise would have 

provided for the operation of the -- the 

operation of the program.  And then the contract 

support cost obligation is itself tied as funds 

to support that amount.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Except my confusion

 is you're saying that the secretarial amount 

does include the costs of collecting the

 third-party income, right?

 MS. FLYNN: Yes, because -- yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah.  And you --

you incur overhead costs when you spend that

 third-party income as well, which I take to be 

the entire dispute here, is whether they get 

coverage for that, right? 

MS. FLYNN: Right, but I guess I would 

say the -- the costs of collection and billing, 

that is associated with providing the services 

using the secretarial amount itself.  These 

later costs of deciding how to spend those 

funds, which may not even be -- happen during 

the same contract period, that is not tied up 

with the services being provided in the first 

instance. 

So the billing function, we think, 

comes over with the secretarial amount because 

it's tied up with providing the services and 

getting the funds in -- in return but not with 

the later decisions about how to spend this 

money, which could be spent on building a new

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I think 

the answer, though, if I understood it

 correctly, to Justice Barrett is that when IHS

 does collect third-party payments, it spends 

that money to advance Indian health, and that

 includes some overhead costs? 

MS. FLYNN: Yes, that is correct.  But 

what the statute is telling us to look to for 

purposes of deciding what counts for contract 

support cost reimbursement is a federal program 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, I -- I 

understand.  My question was IHS.  And so, when 

IHS spends that money, it incurs some overhead 

costs, and those are obviously paid for by the 

federal government.

 raise an argument.  I've got page 27 of the

 brief in front of me. "At a minimum, contract

 support costs are recoverable when program 

income is used to fund enumerated services 

within the contractual scope of work."

 And he says on page 29 that the

 Northern Arapaho are prepared to prove that 

every penny of program income was, in fact, 

spent for activities enumerated in the 

contractual scope of work. 

MS. FLYNN: So I don't understand that

suggesting about --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why not?  I -- I --

my argument was -- my question was, aren't they 

obliged under (m)(1) to spend on general

also obligated to spend in accordance with the 

contractual services that they've agreed to 

provide with -- for the government?

 But the other thing is I believe for

of the federal program as that funded by the 

secretarial amount, the appropriated funds, but

 also third-party income because that's what IHS

 would do when running these programs itself.

 And I was pointing to the statutory 

phrase, "the federal program that is the subject

 of the contract."  And that's in 5325(a)(3)(i). 

And the program that is the subject of the

 contract is the program that the tribe is 

agreeing to undertake in exchange for the 

secretarial amount, and you know that from model 

contract language that appears in the contract. 

For instance, in the Northern -- or in 

the San Carlos Apache Tribe's contract, it's at 

JA 54, where it says, "The contractor shall not 

be obligated to continue performance that 

requires an expenditure of funds in excess of 

the amount of funds awarded under this 

Contract."  So that is tethering the obligation 

to perform to the secretarial amount. 

There's also a provision which also 

comes from the model contract language that's 

enacted into the statute, and in the San Carlos 

Apache Tribe's contract, it's at JA 51, it says, 

"The purpose of the contract is to transfer the

 So we think the subject of the 

contract language in the contract support cost

 provision, which the next sub-clause which also

 refers to the federal program, we think, is 

referring back up to, is the program that is

 delineated by the secretarial amount, the one 

that the contractor is promising to undertake in 

exchange for the secretarial amount, and not 

parts -- services funded by other funding 

streams. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  How do you square 

that view and that interpretation with the rule 

of construction that the statute gives us, which 

says -- I'm looking at 532 -- 5321(g) -- that 

"each provision...shall be liberally construed 

for the benefit of the Indian tribe 

participating in self-determination..."? 

So to the extent -- I don't know 

whether we need to think of this as ambiguous or 

not, but they make an argument about what those 

same provisions mean.  Why aren't we bound by 

this statutory mandate to construe them in their

this Court has phrased the canon in its cases

MS. FLYNN: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I know some of 

my colleagues believe that we shouldn't be 

making choices of who to favor in interpretive 

principles.  But it's not us making that choice; 

it's the statute making that choice, correct? 

MS. FLYNN: Yes.  The statute calls 

for the application of the Indian canon. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, if 

there is an ambiguity, it should be -- we should 

follow the dictates of the choice specified by 

Congress, correct?  You think there's none, but

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can you just, on 

the funding amount, 800 million to 2 billion, 

put that in context here?  Because, you know, 

that number's not contextualized. 

MS. FLYNN: Sure.  So IHS's current 

contract support cost obligation is about 1 

billion per year.  Its total funding is 8 

billion per year.  And because contract support 

costs are discretionary funding, it falls under 

discretionary funding caps government-wide but 

also applicable to this committee. 

And so it stands to reason that if all 

of a sudden contract support costs just explode, 

Congress is going to have to find the cuts 

elsewhere to keep the budget under the 

discretionary spending caps.  And we believe 

there's a real danger that that funding is going

 budget, which is providing direct services to 

tribes that decide not to enter into these

 contracts in contexts --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Because Congress

 couldn't cut, without changing its rules, 

mandatory spending, correct, so it would have to

 come out of the other discretionary funding?

 MS. FLYNN: That's what the cap 

applies to, yes.  And, you know, IHS has asked 

for this funding to be transferred to mandatory 

funding.  It's asked for years.  Congress has 

not done that.  And so --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  When you say "this 

funding," which funding? 

MS. FLYNN: Both just CSC or Contract 

Support Costs in particular and also all of 

IHS's income.

okay. I understand that.

 On the 35 years point, Justice

 Gorsuch -- I'm just interested in your further 

response to things changed in 2010 after the

 Health Care Act was passed in 2010.  What was

 your full response to that?  Do you see that as 

causing the change that prompted this issue, or

 where -- where else do you see it coming from, 

other than the overall underfunding problem that 

Justice Sotomayor raised? 

MS. FLYNN: So I don't understand --

Congress in the Affordable Care Act enacted this 

payor of last resort provision, but it's not 

part of ISDA, it's not part of the Indian Health 

Care Improvement Act, and so I don't -- I don't 

understand Congress to have wanted to affect a 

sea change to ISDA funding by way of that 

provision.  I'm not aware of anything in the 

legislative background suggesting that that was 

the case. 

I would also say that I understood the 

tribes to be saying that there were changes made 

in 1994 that actually affected this change. 

They think that's by the addition of (m) and

also the fact that the model contract now has 

the authority section that cross-references all

 of Title I.

 I think that would be a very sort of 

triple bank shot way of getting across this

 meaning when Congress was otherwise addressing 

the relationship between contract funding and 

the receipt of third-party income.

 But also, if that is what Congress 

tried to accomplish in 1994, nobody noticed for 

decades.  IHS has been administering this 

program the way we've been advocating for in 

this case since that time. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Has anyone in 

Congress raised concerns about that that you're 

aware of?

contract support cost dispute vis-à-vis 

third-party reimbursement income coming up in

know, something that IHS doesn't have to provide 

for itself or hire lawyers for itself because it 

has government lawyers outside the agency that 

it can rely on, correct?

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yes, okay.  So, in 

arguing that these cannot count as contract 

support costs, does your argument really hinge

your brief to be saying that these are expenses 

that the Secretary wouldn't normally incur in 

spending the money because the Secretary has 

constraints in the way it can spend third-party 

income that do not apply to the tribe.

 Do I have that right?

 MS. FLYNN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So why 

couldn't these then be contract support costs 

under 5325(a)(2)?  Because they are not costs 

that are normally -- and I want you to ignore 

your argument about the threshold 5325(a)(2) for 

this point and just look at 50 -- 5325(a)(2)(A). 

They -- why can't they count as costs 

that the Secretary does not incur but the tribes 

do? Is your argument just because they're not 

incurred in operation of the program?

if I take Your Honor to be saying that these 

would qualify under (a)(2)(B) --

MS. FLYNN: So I think that what

 (a)(2)(A) is asking about is actually the

 expenses like the overhead expenses or the

 expenses like worker comp that comes along with

 spending, so not with the underlying activity of 

earning the money in the first instance if --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But aren't these

 costs that tag along with spending, like

 spending the third-party funds to do whatever it 

is the tribes choose to do to further the 

general purposes of the contract? 

MS. FLYNN: Right, but the same way 

that these costs tag along with providing the 

services when you're running the program in the 

first instance.  So what -- the -- when we're 

talking about the expenses, we're saying the 

expense -- the added workers' compensation 

expense that comes along with providing a 

service, and so I take the tribes to be arguing 

that it's -- if the service is funded one way or 

another way, that that's why the expense would 

be eligible for contract support costs if it is 

part of the federal program that is eligible for 

funding.

The payor of last resort provision, 

again, not part of ISDA, is just speaking to 

when there are eligible sources of funding, 

which payor has to pay that. But I'm not sure I

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And if 

the costs balloon, which seems to be a lot of 

your concern, you explored with Justice

 Kavanaugh where the cuts might have to come

 from, but I'm wondering if there's something 

that precludes renegotiation of the contracts in

 light of potential cost escalations of the 

nature that you're talking about? 

MS. FLYNN: So I take the tribes to be 

arguing that we don't have flexibility to change 

the model contract language that incorporates 

(m)(1) in the way that they think gives rise to 

this obligation to pay contract support costs. 

I'm not sure --

interest here how -- how these contracts work. 

There's no opportunity for the government to

particular contract language that's not required

disputed costs are indirect costs.

 Under Section 5325(a)(3)(A)(ii), such

 costs are recoverable if they're incurred in

 connection with the operation of the federal 

program, function, service, or activity pursuant 

to the contract. The disputed costs in this

 case meet that description.  If IHS was running 

tribal healthcare, it would collect program 

income and spend it on healthcare services. 

In the ISDA contract, IHS transferred 

to the tribe the responsibility both to collect 

and to spend the program income on healthcare. 

So, when the tribe carries out healthcare 

services using program income, it does so as a 

means of fulfilling its contractual obligation 

to further the general purposes of the contract. 

So it's acting pursuant to the contract. 

And a similar analysis applies to the 

smaller amount of direct contract support 

costs sought by Northern Arapaho under Section 

5325(a)(3)(A)(i). 

Section 5326 is no barrier for the 

tribes' recovery of costs in this case. The 

costs are directly attributable to the contract 

because they arise from the tribes' work

 have nothing to do with the work under those

 Finally, ruling in the tribes' favor

 would further the purposes of the ISDA by

 promoting tribal self-determination and ensuring 

that adequate resources are available for 

healthcare in chronically underserved 

communities.

 first-line argument, in 1988, Congress enacted 

(a)(2), and there's lots of disputes after that

 over what was covered, what wasn't covered.

 IHS was chronically not paying.  And 

so, in '94, Congress added (a)(3) to clarify 

that those categories of costs are deemed to 

satisfy (a)(2). So it seems to me that if 

Congress goes out of its way --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Where does it say 

that? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, it says "shall 

include."  So, if you look at the ordering, 

(a)(3) says "the contract support costs that are 

eligible costs for the purposes of receiving 

funding under this chapter shall include" the 

enumerated categories.  There's no 

cross-reference to (a)(2).  There's no proviso. 

There is a proviso on (a)(1) but not (a)(2). 

So it just seems to me viewing this 

text literally, if you satisfy (a)(3), you 

prevail, and that's the point of adding this 

clarification. 

But I just want to be clear, if you 

don't agree with anything I just said, that's 

not essential to our position.  If you think

that we have to satisfy (a)(2), emphatically we

 think that we do.  You know, (a)(2) says that 

the costs "shall consist of an amount for the

 reasonable cost of activities which must be 

carried out by a tribal organization as a 

contractor to ensure compliance with the terms 

of the contract. That is satisfied because 

(m)(1) is a term of the contract."

 When we are collecting and then 

spending the -- the program income, we are 

acting as a contractor.  We must, under the 

contract, collect this money and spend it on 

healthcare services.  So we're acting as a 

contractor just as much as we're acting as a 

contractor when we spend money on the 

secretarial amount. 

So, based on the first part of the 

argument, there was a number of questions that 

arose which I wanted to answer.  I wanted to 

answer the questions about non-beneficiaries, as 

well as some of Justice Barrett and some of 

Justice Kavanaugh's questions.

that, really quickly, so (m)(1) is a term of the

 contract, but what do you say about their

 argument that (m) -- the (m)(1) obligation is

 more open-ended than the scope of the work

 itself?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I mean, it does 

give the tribe a measure of discretion. It

 talks about general purposes, but I think that 

has to be read in conjunction with the contract 

itself, which doesn't say that the purpose is 

just generally to promote healthcare or 

generally promote -- to promote, excuse me, 

self-determination.  There's like a purpose 

provision that says that the purpose of the 

contract is to transfer an enumerated set --

enumerated set of obligations from IHS to the 

tribe. 

So it seems to me that furthering the 

general purpose of the contract requires 

slotting it in one of those enumerated purposes 

or at least something that's like really close 

to those purposes.  I realize the word "purpose" 

has "general," the word "general," attached to 

it, but I don't think that that entitles the

tribes to just do whatever it wants to or spend

 the money on healthcare in general.  It's got to 

be tied to the purpose provision in the contract

 itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I 

mean, if you add the direction to interpret the

 statutory language in favor of the tribes, that 

purpose provision doesn't seem to me to be a

 very significant constraint.  I mean, the -- you 

know, the -- the argument on the other side -- I 

-- or at least one of the concerns is that the 

tribes would be able to expand the provision of 

healthcare to all sorts of areas that do not 

primarily benefit tribal members and yet still 

be entitled to reimbursement. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  All right.  So let me 

address this issue of non-beneficiaries head-on 

because I understand it came up significantly in 

the first part of the argument. 

Okay. So, first of all, for about 

half of tribes, including San Carlos, they don't 

serve non-beneficiaries at all. Even for the 

others, it's often very little.  So let me just 

explain what Northern Arapaho does because a 

statement was made in the first half of the

argument about Northern Arapaho's services to

 non-beneficiaries.

           Non- -- Northern Arapaho does serve

 non-beneficiaries but only if they're employees

 of Northern Arapaho's healthcare program, and 

that's less than 3 percent of the total number 

of users of Northern Arapaho's program. So, if

 there's a nurse who's non-Indian who lives on 

the reservation and works at a Northern Arapaho 

clinic and then she wants to get her blood 

pressure checked, then, as an employee benefit, 

she can do that in the same building.  She 

doesn't have to drive potentially a long 

distance in central Wyoming to some other 

clinic. 

But that is not -- that's not paid for 

by IHS.  She has to pay out of pocket or, 

realistically, from her own insurance policy, 

okay? So none of the Secretary's funding ever 

goes to the provision of healthcare to those 

non-beneficiaries. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's not true for 

some tribes, is it? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, I think it's true 

for all tribes.  The tribes can serve, but they

can't be a diminution of healthcare services for 

Indians. So I think the way it works is the

 non-Indian has to pay out of pocket for the --

or from the person's own insurance policy, and

 the tribe collects that money.  I will 

acknowledge the tribe does consider that to be

 program income.  That's not a question raised in

 this case. 

But the tribe thinks that if it's 

actually collecting that money, that's program 

income, but it then spends every single penny of 

that money on services for Indians.  We never 

ever spend the program income that we obtain on 

services for non-Indians. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but 

you're --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is that true for 

all tribes? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes, I think it is 

true. Absolutely it's true, that non-Indians 

who use the services, they have to pay from 

their own insurance policy.  The tribe might 

collect that money and spend it, but the tribe 

is not spending program income to fund services

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but they 

-- you're talking about the -- the -- the 

principle, but we're talking about support

 services, and I assume they don't -- well, maybe

 they do -- allocate support services differently

 depending upon which services go primarily to

 non- -- non-tribal members and others to tribal

 members? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So, historically, 

Northern Arapaho hasn't done that just because 

it's such a tiny percentage.  That's a question 

that's not raised in this case. 

I think that the government, if it 

wishes to, can argue, can defend a case on the 

ground that a portion of the services that are 

allocable to non-Indians shouldn't be included. 

And that's fine.  That can -- that can be 

litigated. 

I mean, there's -- the -- the argument 

on the other side is that there's this 

provision, Section 1680, that says -- 1680c, 

that says that services provided shall be -- to 

non-Indians shall be deemed to be provided under 

this agreement.  But, like, that hasn't been

we'd ask the Court to -- to reserve that

 question.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if I can understand 

what your argument on page 27 refers to, what 

the limitation is in that argument and what it's

 not.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Okay.  So the

 argument -- the alternative argument we have 

made is that every single penny of program 

income that we receive under these contract 

years, we spend it on services enumerated in the 

scope of work for Indians only, okay? 

And that's really because the scope of 

work for Northern Arapaho is pretty broad.  It's 

like all, you know, outpatient medical services, 

dental services, radiology.  There's, you know, 

behavioral health.  There's lots and lots of 

different services that are transferred in the 

scope of work.  And so every -- all the dollars 

we spend are allocated towards programs in the 

scope of work. 

But I just want to be clear, the --

the broader argument, we're not saying you can 

use program income to give -- to -- to offer

That's what the general purpose of the contract

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But you're saying

 you should get --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- put aside the

So what exactly are the general purposes of the

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Okay.  So the purposes 

of the contract -- I'll get to "general" -- the 

modifier "general" in just one second.  The 

purposes of the contract are laid out in the 

self-determination agreement -- contract itself. 

And that's part of the model agreement.  It says 

the purposes are to transfer the enumerated set 

of services from IHS to the tribe. That's the 

purpose. 

So, in terms of what "general purpose" 

means, I think that gives the tribe a little bit 

of discretion. Just as one example, tribes have 

generally construed "general purposes" to open

 We're talking about a reservation in central

 Wyoming with an incredibly poor population of

 Native Americans.

 And general purposes of the contract,

 you'd agree it has to be Indians?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY: One hundred percent I

 agree, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And in your 

contract, in terms of what's enumerated as the 

general purposes, include outpatient ambulatory 

medical care and primary care, nursing, mental 

health, the clinical medical laboratory, 

radiology, physical therapy, the pharmacy, 

optometry, dental care, and community health. 

You'd agree it has to be limited to those things

 something like that, then it would have to go 

only to emergency services, is that correct?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I agree.  I mean, 

that's maybe more of a question for Mr. Miller,

 who -- his client had such a contract. But,

 yes, that is my understanding of -- of "general

 purposes."

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you do 

with their argument that there are expenses that 

the government doesn't incur, like building 

buildings, that that's not included in their 

formula?  Why should you get support service 

funds for that activity? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So my primary answer 

to that is we actually don't.  I mean, there's 

-- there's back-and-forth in the briefs about 

this, but, like, the cost methodology of IHS 

actually requires us to deduct the construction 

cost from the cost base when we're calculating 

contract support costs. 

So, translated into English, what that 

means is that if we're essentially hiring a 

subcontract to build a building, we just 

transfer a bunch of money to the subcontractor,

 subcontractor who has the overhead, not us.

 So, under the IHS's cost allocation 

methodology in the Indian Health Manual, we have

 to deduct those costs anyway.  So, as a

 practical matter, it -- it really doesn't come

 up.

 The other thing is it's not like

 Congress doesn't like construction.  It's just 

there's two separate appropriations provisions. 

Like there's one to the Indian Health Service 

for services, and then there's a separate stream 

for -- for construction.  And so Congress has 

just ensured that there's no mixing, that a

I ask one -- I mean, the government's, one of

 their biggest arguments is the practical

 consequences of this, that you're going to be

 depriving money from direct service tribes.

 How do you respond to that?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  All right.  If I can 

offer a couple responses. So, first of all, the 

liberal construction provision in the

 self-determination contract says that the 

provisions of the statute and contract will be 

construed liberally for the benefit of the 

contractor.  So that's the -- that's not all 

tribes in general.  That's for the contractor in 

particular.  So I think the Court should --

should remain focused on the contractor's 

interests when applying that. 

Second of all, I -- I think it's going

like you and Mr. Lloyd left all this money on

 the table for so many years?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So there -- there's 

two basic answers. One is that for many years 

there's these appropriations caps under which 

tribes couldn't even recover contract support 

costs on the secretarial amount. It took two

 cases from this Court, the Cherokee Nation case 

and then the Salazar versus Ramah Navajo Chapter 

case in 2012, for this Court to hold that the 

tribes actually are entitled to all of the 

contract support costs under the statute, and 

that's when these lawsuits started being 

brought. 

And the second point is the payor of 

last resort provision that Justice Gorsuch 

raised.  So, like, that's when tribes really 

started feeling like they had to go out and 

collect this money, they had no choice.  And, by 

the way, it's not just the statute.  Our 

contract, Northern Arapaho's contract, also 

requires us to collect it, and so we were 

encountering all of these support costs. 

So this issue just didn't come up.  I 

don't think that there's some kind of tradition

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, first of all, we 

don't know where that estimate comes from. 

Like, that's not in the record.  It's just a 

conversation between someone at IHS with the 

SG's office giving these numbers that come out 

of nowhere from our perspective.

 be skeptical of these high numbers.

 Like, the government takes the 

position, it represents that contract support 

costs will start exceeding the secretarial

 amount.  I don't think that's ever happened.

 That's certainly not true in these cases.  I

 think that's extremely speculative.

 And also, the other thing is, I mean, 

it's true there's a six-year statute of 

limitations, but I don't think every single 

tribe in the country is going to necessarily 

bring these suits. I mean, I can't -- I can't 

predict. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would they not? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I mean, maybe they --

I mean, I can't predict the types of litigations 

that are going to happen, but, you know, I mean, 

this is what the statute requires, Your Honor.

tribes were getting much less than they were

Congress after this Court's decision in Salazar

you do with -- I don't know that we've mentioned

the third-party income's not a basis for 

reducing the allocation that comes from IHS, 

which suggests that Congress was concerned 

about, oh, because you get this third-party 

money, maybe the IHS amount should be reduced, 

and Congress wanted to say no, that's -- that's 

not correct, and from that, the implication 

would be surely they were not anticipating, oh,

 costs. So, I -- I -- instead of drawing a

 negative implication from (m), I think I would

 just look at the -- a provision just joined at 

the hip in the exact same enactment, (a)(3), 

that specifically addresses the issue of 

contract support costs and said that we can 

recover all costs that are "in connection with 

the operation of the Federal program," which I 

think includes program income.  It's the same 

word, "program," in both provisions. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you agree that 

to be an (a)(3) cost, it has to be an (a)(2) 

cost? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I don't agree, but 

even if I'm wrong on that, it doesn't affect our 

position one bit. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

it doesn't affect your position one bit, because 

it seems to me under (a)(2), you know, there are

 two qualifications in (A) and (B), and I think 

(B) doesn't seem to fit very well, so it would 

have to be (A), but that doesn't seem to fit

 very well either.  So explain to me why that's

 wrong.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I don't agree,

 Your Honor.  In fact, I don't even think it's 

disputed that we satisfy (A) and (B).  I think 

the government is disputing the -- the earlier 

part of the statute talking about a contract to 

ensure compliance. 

So -- so, for example, (A) covers 

things like stuff that the -- that OPM would do, 

human resources or contracting services that GSA 

would do, things like that. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  You mean like 

everybody keeps talking about workers' comp? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yeah.  Or that's --

well, that's not -- that's another thing.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  But -- so overhead --

most of these costs are actually indirect costs,

 not direct costs --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  -- which would be

 workers' comp.  So, for example, you know, the

 tribe wants to hire someone, okay?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  There needs to be an 

HR person.  So, if IHS is running healthcare, 

OPM, a separate branch of the government, is 

going to be doing all that HR stuff, putting 

them on the payroll, making sure they're paid, 

handling their pensions.  So that's an -- that's 

an (A) cost, okay? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  And so the tribe gets 

that from the government because, you know, if 

-- if IHS isn't paying for it, nor should the 

tribe. So what we're seeking in this case are 

all costs that fall under (A) or (B).  It's the 

exact same type of overhead that the Secretary 

wouldn't pay out of pocket.  It's just with 

respect to the programs funded by the program 

income.

 contracting, GSA would do the work.  If IHS was

 shoes. We also are required to collect that

 money and spend it, and so we're just asking to

 be put into the same -- into their shoes for 

purposes of contract support costs.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  And when you spend 

it when you're standing in their shoes, this

 back-and-forth about what furthers the general

 purposes of the contract, you would say or would 

you not say that you can only claim these 

contract support costs for expenditures that are 

of the sort that IHS would also make --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Oh --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- or is it a 

broader universe? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, I think, because 

the -- IHS also has a lot of discretion.  So we 

-- it says for us "further the general purposes 

of the contract."  But IHS has a very, very 

broad discretion to spend the money on Indian 

healthcare as well.  Like, it's true it's 

possible that we might spend a particular dollar 

differently from how IHS would.

that happens with the secretarial amount too 

because the whole point of this statute is to

 promote self-determination.  It reflects the 

assumption that the tribes may spend a

 particular dollar differently from how IHS would 

do it, and Congress thought that was a good

 thing.

 So both -- both the tribe and the IHS 

has a measure of flexibility in spending this 

money on healthcare.  Individual dollars might 

be allocated differently, but the types of 

things we're doing, spending money on 

healthcare, are exactly the types of things that 

IHS would be doing with the same money. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Which might be a 

reason why it's -- your concession is -- was 

that it can't be spent on non-Indian healthcare 

because IHS wouldn't spend it? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Absolutely not.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD B. MILLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN 23-250

 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 

Maybe I'll begin with Justice 

Jackson's question about page 51.  We have six 

programs here, including the EMS program, which 

is a major feature of the government's motion to 

dismiss that was -- that is the subject of this 

case. The third-party revenue spending has to 

be anchored to those six programs. It cannot be 

spent on a dental program.  We don't see dental 

there. It cannot be spent just on general 

health.  Even interpreting that term broadly and 

generously in light of the Indian canon, it 

still has to be anchored in these six programs. 

With regard to these six programs, 

when the Indian Health Service awarded a 

contract to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, and

just visualize this, we're talking about 1.8 

million acres, about 29,000 square miles, a 

thousand miles of roadless area, a couple hours 

east of Phoenix, the Emergency Medical Service 

program was severely underfunded.

 So, on page 101, the Indian Health 

Service demands that the tribe agree to a clause

 that says, in running the EMS program, it will

 maintain an efficient billing system to maximize 

third-party revenues. 

Why? Because IHS knew that there was 

no way this program could be run at even a 

moderate level without third-party revenues 

coming into the program and going out into the 

program, going -- coming in from program income 

and going out into services.  So that's why this 

clause is such a pivotal element of the 

contract. 

Now we rely on (m) -- (m)(1), and 

(m)(1) was enacted in 1994, but that was not the 

first time the concept that program income goes 

into the contract was invented. 

First of all, it is a standard 

government contracting clause in the OMB 

regulations.  You can go to 2 C.F.R. 200.307, I

think it's (e)(2).  But, more specifically, the

 Indian Health Service, in the sample contract 

that the Indian Health Service had in the 1980s,

 required that all program income be spent to 

provide additional services and benefits under

 the contract.

 So this was an old concept, not a new

 concept, that Congress put in there in 1994. 

Well, why did Congress put it in 1994? I mean, 

there it was in the sample contract that IHS had 

because Congress decided that IHS could not be 

trusted to administer this program at all. 

That was the positive provision, that 

program income comes into the contract, but 

there were a lot of negative provisions in the 

old sample contract.  There were a lot of 

negative provisions in regulations that IHS had 

adopted, proposed to adopt in January '94. 

So Congress comes in, clears the 

decks, says we are declaring what the master 

contract is going to say, we are prohibiting a 

raft of things that the agency proposed in these 

regulations, but we are cementing the good 

things.

 general purposes of the contract.  So too the

 question about (a)(2) and (a)(3) and how they

 relate.  They require the administration -- the 

-- the overhead has to be in connection with the

 expenditure of -- of -- of -- the -- excuse me, 

with the administration of the contract.

 And the contract, as we just saw,

 requires the spending of program income.  So we 

satisfy (a)(3).  It's, of course, part of the 

federal program that we discussed earlier.  The 

federal program includes direct service spending 

from the secretarial amount and also program 

income spending.  So -- and IHS spends both 

tranches of money.  The tribe spends both 

tranches of money.

MR. MILLER: Right.  Well, of course, 

as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, it's not 

presented in this case, but I will answer the

 question.

 The issue of the government's 

obligation with respect to services to

 non-beneficiaries has been litigated in another

 setting.  Contract support costs are not the

 only mandatory spending under the Act. There's 

also leasing that is mandatory spending.  If a 

tribe uses a tribal facility to run the federal 

program, then the federal government needs to 

pay the leasing costs. 

That issue has been litigated, and the 

Court have held in the Jamestown case that 

there's a reasonableness limitation to the 

leasing costs.  Incidentally, reasonableness 

comes up twice, once in (a)(2), once in (a)(3). 

So there's a reasonableness limitation on the 

overhead also.  So that's just thing one. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

presumably doesn't have anything to do with the 

allocation between tribal members and non-tribal 

members. 

MR. MILLER: Oh, no.  With respect,

Your Honor, it would mean in this situation that

 if there were substantial overhead costs

 associated with services to non-beneficiaries, 

then you would discount that element, and IHS

 would not be responsible for reimbursing it.

 And I should note that IHS has a

 mechanism already for doing this.  IHS does this 

in the leasing arena. If I go to IHS and ask 

for a lease to compensate for the use of a 

tribal facility, IHS will ask for data, how many 

non-beneficiaries do you serve?  Zero. Then the 

they cover the whole lease.  Fifty percent, 

which is unheard of, but 50 -- well, there are 

examples, I suppose, then IHS will whack off a 

part of the leasing cost to be sure that they 

are only supporting services to Indians because 

this is an Indian healthcare program. 

I also wanted to address the --

-- I don't think it's a great statutory answer.

 So keep going.

 MR. MILLER: I -- I agree with Your 

Honor that if a -- if a construction activity 

serves the general purposes of, let's just take 

the EMS program, then it's under the umbrella.

 It's within.  Let's consider it.

 So building a garage to house the 

ambulances or to do maintenance work on the 

ambulances, Roger.  To build a new facility 

where the ambulance crews were sleeping because 

they were decrepit and there were -- there were 

holes in the walls and -- and it was not an 

acceptable place for ambulance crews to sleep in 

between calls, so, yes, reconstructing a new 

facility to house the ambulance crews, 

absolutely. 

Are those construction activities 

things that the tribe can do with the 

third-party revenue money but that IHS cannot do 

because it needs permission from Congress?  Yes. 

That is a fact. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yes is the answer 

to that? 

MR. MILLER: Yes is that -- is the

-- the overhead for that, just to follow up on

already answered this, I just want to --

that, just as if you and I hire a --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's what you're 

seeking, right? 

MR. MILLER: Yes, but there would be 

no overhead on it, is what I was about to say, 

Your Honor.  Unless I'm a general contractor 

building my own house, I hire a company to build 

a new house.  And the tribe hires a company to 

build that garage.  It doesn't build it itself. 

So the company that hires pays --

charges you $500,000, a million dollars to build 

that garage.  You don't have any overhead.  You 

just procure the contract, but you're not 

running the contract. So this is why my friend

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you going to 

include any overhead as contract support?

 MR. MILLER: No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the question of 

who's going to pay for this -- and the reason I

 am looking at this is not some kind of fiscal 

responsibility canon or something.  It's just 

trying to figure out how Congress would have 

been thinking about this. 

But, if the discretionary cap stays 

the same, the money here -- and I asked Mr. 

Unikowsky this -- the money here will 

necessarily come from other tribes receiving --

who don't provide the healthcare services 

themselves, where IHS provides the healthcare 

services directly.  That's almost logically 

necessary, right? 

MR. MILLER: Well, it -- it --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's not -- that 

doesn't defeat your argument, but it does 

perhaps shade how we think about the overall 

structure of the statute a little bit.

by reference everything that my -- my friend

 said, except the answer to that question.  CBO

 will advise the appropriations chairman and

 chairwoman in the Senate and the House what the 

-- what the spending projections are for the 

next year. So, if Your Honors make a decision 

here in fiscal year '24 and we're looking at 

fiscal year '25 or '26, they will make that

 decision to the appropriate -- they will provide 

that information to the appropriators.  The 

appropriators then have to divvy up the 

appropriation in 13 pieces, mindful of what they 

learned from CBO about all 13 of those. 

This cost, let's say it goes up $500 

million, I have no idea what it would be.  There 

is no data on that.  Then that is an element 

that the appropriations committee decides in 

allocating the 13. 

Then, when it gets to the environment 

and natural resources committee, that committee 

decides how to further divvy it up among the 

American Indian Museum and the BIA and the 

Interior Department and all of its agencies at 

the Interior Department.  There is no way to 

predict what the ultimate impact would be on the

 And to suggest that no, no, it's going

 to be a dollar-for-dollar impact on Indian

 services, it wasn't after the Ramah case.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.

 MR. MILLER: That's the best proof.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So I think I -- I 

-- so that's -- a reasonable answer to that 

question would be, well, you're assuming the 

discretionary cap would stay the same, but 

you're wrong.  I'm wrong in thinking that the 

discretionary cap will necessarily stay the same 

based on the process.  That's a predictive 

judgment you're making. 

MR. MILLER: Right.  And part of it is 

because the IHS appropriation was an 8 or $9 

billion appropriation inside a $55 billion 

appropriation --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well --

MR. MILLER:  -- which is inside a $700 

billion discretionary appropriation.  So there's 

just no way really to predict that.

 will you provide with that?

 MR. MILLER: Oh, yes.  Well, the --

They would upgrade, constant upgrade I

roads. So they would upgrade ambulances, 

upgrade equipment in the ambulances, and upgrade 

the training of the EMT crews. This is just the 

normal -- normal work of an EMS program. And, 

most importantly, reduce response times.

that it falls under 5325(a)(1) in the

MR. MILLER: And we can find where the 

billing operations are spelled out in the

 contract.  Overhead on the program collection

 activity is an (a)(2) cost. So, even as to the 

Secretary, there are two buckets funding the

 tribe.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.

 MR. MILLER: The -- the -- the

 program, the activity itself and the overhead 

associated.  But (a)(2), like (a)(3), isn't 

limited to what comes to the tribe under (a)(1). 

(a)(2) is limited by the terms of the 

contract, not by the terms of (a)(1).  I know 

the government's brief on page 2, I think, dices 

and rearranges the words, but the costs are to 

support the contract and contract compliance 

costs. So the touchstone for (a)(2), like 

(a)(3), is what does the contract say. 

So the overhead that's covered by 

(a)(2) and (a)(3) is to support anything that's 

in the contract, and that contract includes 

spending program income. 

And with regard to breaking the bank, 

by the way, you're only talking about an average 

indirect cost rate around the United States is

25 percent, although my client's rate was

 17 percent.  So they lost out on about

 17 percent of the program income spending they

 should have had.

 That's important.  But what's really

 important under the Indian Self-Determination

 Act is they couldn't do what IHS could have

 done. And if I could just take a moment, had 

IHS been in the situation that the tribe was in, 

running a $10 million program a year, and IHS 

had 50 percent program revenue, program income 

to spend, and then -- and then its own 

appropriations to spend, 50/50, IHS wouldn't 

have to take one dime. All of that money would 

be locally spent to provide care. 

But, when the tribe comes in, if it 

has a 25 percent indirect cost rate and we had 5 

million from one source, 5 million from another 

source, 10 million total, 2 and a half billion 

dollars required for indirect costs, we have to 

fund some of that 2 and a half million out of 

the program revenue that came into the tribe. 

IHS doesn't have that. They get the 

benefit of the whole 10 million. And the tribe 

would get the benefit of the whole 10 million if

So, first, I do want to emphasize at 

the outset that we have been talking a lot today

 about the funding provisions in 5325(a) and (m)

 and how those work together, but there is a

 separate prohibition that does apply,

 notwithstanding any other provision of law, and

 that -- says that IHS cannot pay costs that are

 not directly attributable to the ISDA contract.

 Here, there is an extended chain of 

causation.  The tribe has to first perform 

services that are eligible for receiving 

reimbursements, it then has to collect that 

money, then decide how to spend that money, 

which may not even be during the same contract 

period, and then it has to be the kind of 

expenditure that generates what would otherwise 

be an eligible contract support cost.  That is 

too extended of a chain to fit within "directly 

attributable" and so payment of these funds is 

independently barred. 

The second thing I want to address, 

this question of whether when we're talking 

about the kind of third-party reimbursement 

income that can trigger this corresponding 

contract support cost obligation from IHS, there

were questions about whether that kind of income

 includes income from serving non-beneficiaries 

or just income from serving Indians.

 And I took my friend from the Northern 

Arapaho to say that they do consider the program 

income they're talking about in this case to 

include both kinds of reimbursement revenue. 

That is how I understood the arguments to be in

 this case thus far. 

But I also took my friends on the 

other side to say that you do not have to decide 

that question about whether the kind of 

reimbursement income that could potentially 

trigger CSC from IHS includes income from 

serving non-Indians. And I would encourage the 

Court at the very least to reserve that issue 

and not decide whether that amount of income can 

include that kind of income stream. 

There were also questions about our 

budget estimate in this case, about the 

repercussions of this case.  I do want to 

clarify that, yes, our estimate is based on --

if you base contract support costs on all kinds 

of third-party reimbursement income that can 

come in, and so it is tied to that, but that

 whether it comes from serving non-beneficiaries

 or beneficiaries, because IHS doesn't have 

reason to collect that information in a

 comprehensive way.  But we can look at the value 

of the claims that have been made so far and we 

can look to how much third-party reimbursement 

income IHS comes -- brings in to make estimates. 

The value of the claims we're seeing 

so far, we are already facing a claim in the 

District of Arizona seeking nearly $110 million 

in additional contract support costs for a 

single contract year.  We're seeing other claims 

for 40 million for a single contract year and 90 

million for another contract year.  In one of 

those cases, the Gila River case, there's a 

single fiscal year where the tribe -- what the 

tribe is saying that they are owed in contract 

support costs is about $48 million, and that --

that's the total including what they were 

already paid, and that comes close to what they

received in the secretarial amount for that same

 year, which was $51 million.

 So our prediction that this will 

eventually overtake the secretarial amount, we 

think, is sound, and that's in part because of 

the allegations like those in the San Carlos 

Apaches' complaint that if they had received an

 additional $3 million in contract support costs, 

they would have been able to produce another $5 

million in third-party reimbursement income, and 

that is part of the damages claim that they are 

seeking against us in this case. 

I would also say that our estimate 

about the forward-looking budget impact does not 

include the value of any of these retrospective 

judgments that do have a six-year statute of 

limitations. 

Finally, just one final point, there's 

been discussion about what falls within 

(m)(1) -- sorry -- 5325(m)(1) and what counts as 

being within the general purposes of the 

contract.  I would -- I understood my friends to 

be saying it has to be very closely tied to 

contract services, although there seems to be 

some expenses, like building facilities, which

can be done under ISDA but has to be done under 

a separate ISDA contract if the tribe wants to 

fund it that way, but they think that they could

 fund that using third-party reimbursement

 income.

 I would say also, though, that (m)(1)

 has to be read consistently with 1641(d)(2).

 This is the provision of the IHCIA that also

 governs the same reimbursement income, and that 

provision says that tribes can spend it on any 

healthcare-related purpose or otherwise to 

achieve the general objectives of the IHCIA. 

You have to read those consistently. 

It can't be that (m)(1) permits -- forbids uses 

that this other provision permits, and so that's 

why I do think that the -- the idea that tribes 

are limited to spending this just on program 

services cannot be correct. 

If there are no further questions, we 

ask that you reverse in both cases. Thank you, 

Your Honor.
