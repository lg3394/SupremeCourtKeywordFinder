 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-585, Culley

 versus Marshall.

 Mr. Dvoretzky.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The question presented is narrow: 

Should courts apply Mathews or Barker to assess 

the sufficiency of process in civil forfeiture 

proceedings?  The answer is Mathews. 

Mathews is the default due process 

standard for civil cases and for good reason. 

It assesses both the private and governmental 

interests to guard against unreasonable risks of 

error. And the Court has consistently applied 

it to determine whether more process is due, 

including in Good, another civil forfeiture 

case. 

Respondents prefer Barker because 

Barker's answer is always no additional process. 

But Respondents' primary argument is just that

$8,850 and Von Neumann already decided the

 question, not that Barker makes sense and

 Mathews doesn't.

           Respondents are wrong. As the Second 

and Sixth Circuits have explained in adopting 

Mathews over Barker, $8,850 and Von Neumann 

concern the length of time for a final 

disposition rather than the need for an interim 

hearing. The litigants in $8,850 and Von 

Neumann also were not claiming innocence, so 

they were not seeking and the Court did not 

address retention hearings. 

Only Mathews can answer the 

sufficiency-of-process question. The courts of 

appeals and state supreme courts that have 

addressed the question presented have 

overwhelmingly chosen Mathews over Barker. 

Although the Court need not go beyond 

the methodological question presented and apply 

the Mathews factors, the point of Mathews isn't 

to -- is to ensure that laws adequately protect 

the Constitution's fundamental due process 

guarantee, taking into account the private and 

governmental interests at stake. It's not to 

micromanage state legislatures.

Official 

The easiest way for a jurisdiction to 

ensure its laws comport with due process, as the 

Second and Sixth Circuits have explained, is 

generally to offer a reasonably prompt

 post-seizure hearing to allow claimants to raise

 an innocent owner argument.  Indeed, numerous 

states have done just that, and their experience

 makes clear, contrary to Respondents' 

contentions, that retention hearings are 

workable and effective. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Before we get to the 

choice between Barker and Mathews, isn't there 

the -- an antecedent question as to whether or 

not there's any constitutional requirement for 

additional hearings in the context of 

forfeiture? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Thomas, I 

think that that question is what Barker or 

Mathews, depending on which test this Court were 

to choose as the answer --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the reason I 

ask that is because you seem to assume that a --

an additional hearing is required. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  We're not assuming

that an additional hearing is required.  We're 

saying that Mathews is the way to analyze

 whether an additional hearing is required. 

Mathews is the test that the Court has applied 

in cases like Good, where a litigant comes 

forward and says the -- the process being 

provided in this case, as in Good, no hearing,

 is insufficient.  And the way to think of that 

under Mathews is to say, well, what are the 

private interests in a hearing, what are the 

governmental interests on the other side, and 

what would be the value of additional process? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let me ask you 

this. In -- in your case, if you had filed a 

motion for summary judgment a week after the 

property had been taken or the process had 

begun, forfeiture proceedings began, would --

would you be here? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think -- I 

think we would be here. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Why?  You would have 

your property back because you -- you won on 

summary judgment, right? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  We -- we won on 

summary judgment after going through discovery

 Summary judgment, we -- we would have

judge would expedite summary judgment.  There's

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But what would be

MR. DVORETZKY:  Hypothetically, we 

could have, just as somebody could come to this

 Court and -- and ask it for extraordinary relief 

that the Court is under no obligation to

 provide.

 Due process doesn't depend on whether 

a court is going to exercise its discretion to

 expedite a case.  Realistically, courts rarely

 do that. And, moreover, the summary judgment 

standard, that's about proving your ultimate 

entitlement on the merits definitively. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you said 

courts rarely do that. Do we have any evidence 

about how long or how often courts in Alabama 

grant motions to expedite in this context? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, the -- Mr. Chief 

Justice, there -- there is not a record on that. 

I think, as a -- as a practical matter, not in 

the record, it's not very common, but in terms 

of applying the Mathews factors, that is 

something that could be considered and that 

could be developed on remand in assessing what 

is the value of additional procedures.

summary judgment is to decide the ultimate 

question, who owns the car, correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The purpose of a

keeps custody of the car, correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the focus is, 

therefore, different?  The focus in the post- --

in the -- in the hearing would be is -- there 

might be a disputed issue of fact with respect 

to ownership.  The government might claim it 

needs discovery.  A government might claim it 

has some facts that would lead to a judgment 

that it needs to explore.  But the court would 

then weigh whether or not that is sufficient not 

to give custody to the car owner pending the

about that same kind of thing, what the

 difference is between the retention hearing and 

the final forfeiture determination, I mean, take 

a case like this, where your client is raising

 an -- an innocent owner defense, and I would

 think that the questions about whether she was 

an innocent owner are pretty much the same in

 the retention hearing and in the final

 forfeiture determination, isn't that correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I think the 

substantive question is -- is -- is the same, 

yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now there is a 

different burden, but if she can prove at the 

retention hearing under a probable cause 

standard that she is entitled to the car back, I 

mean, there's no way the government is going to 

lose on the final determination, right?  I mean, 

she's proved that she's entitled to the car? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I -- I think 

that's most likely correct.  In theory, by the 

time of the final determination, there could be 

some additional discovery or investigation that 

happens that would change the calculus. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, I suppose --

 case, but most likely --

MR. DVORETZKY:  Most likely. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the government 

probably would just give up at that point,

 right? Under this, you know, very generous 

standard to the government they've lost, they're 

not going to keep on pursuing the thing, so 

she's gotten her car back and the case is over. 

And I guess what this suggests is that 

in both cases, you're really adjudicating the 

same thing, which is like am I entitled to my 

car back right now? So how is it really 

different?  I -- I understand saying this is 

interim, this is final, but in the end, it's 

just: am I entitled to my car back now? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Kagan, I think 

that the substantive question is the same, but 

there are a few key differences between the 

retention hearing and the later merits 

determination. 

For one thing, I don't know that the

 procedural standard later.  The government has

 the opportunity to conduct more discovery.  The

 government also has, in -- in -- in Alabama, as 

well as 25 other states, a financial incentive

 to keep pursuing the forfeiture proceedings 

because they get to keep the proceeds.

 And so I don't know that it's 

empirically correct that the government would 

simply give up if it loses at the -- the -- the 

retention hearing.  In addition to that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I guess what 

I'm -- what I'm asking is, if -- if -- if we've 

had a case that says, you know, the 

constitutional rule about forcing a 

determination about what -- about -- about who's 

entitled to the car is the Barker rule, you 

know, why it is that we can say: Well, we have 

that rule, but, in fact, there's -- there's 

another constitutional rule which is much more 

beneficial to the claimant that's meant to 

address exactly the same question that we held

are different questions, as the Second and the

 Sixth Circuit have explained.

 In Barker -- in -- in Barker, the only

 question -- it was essentially a case where

 the -- the claimant was trying to argue a

 "gotcha."  There was no argument in got -- in

 Barker -- I'm sorry, in $8,850 or Von Neumann 

that the government was not ultimately entitled

 to forfeit the property.  There was no innocent 

owner defense. 

The claimant's argument there was, 

well, but you waited too long in order to 

actually complete the proceedings and, 

therefore, I get my car back. And in that 

situation, this -- this Court said the Barker 

test applies. 

There's a different argument where you 

have an innocent owner defense, where you have 

somebody coming forward and saying:  I should be 

entitled as a matter of Alabama state law, the 

rights that Alabama state law gives to me, I 

should be entitled to keep my car.  And the 

state can't effect a de facto forfeiture of that 

car for months or years during the pendency of 

proceedings.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But, in both --

MR. DVORETZKY:  That's a --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- cases, the 

claimant wants the property back in the -- in

 the interim.  And the court, I mean, couldn't

 have been much clearer in its language.

 The forfeiture proceeding without more

 provides the -- the hearing required by due 

process to protect Von Neumann's property 

interest in the car, and then repeated it two 

pages later, the right to a forfeiture 

hearing here -- proceeding meeting the Barker 

test satisfies any due process right with 

respect to the car and the money. 

And those, to me, didn't seem to be 

accidental comments.  I went back to the oral 

argument transcript where exactly this question 

was posed about is that all the process that's 

-- that's due, and the court was very 

definitive. 

So you've -- you've referred a few

are broad, clear statements that have guided

 courts since.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Kavanaugh, I

 think those statements have broad language that 

has to be understood in context.

 With respect to the first sentence

 that you quoted -- the -- the forfeiture

 proceeding without more provides the

 post-seizure hearing that due process requires 

-- that was in part 2 of Von Neumann. 

Part 2 of Von Neumann was the section 

of that opinion holding that the claimant had no 

due process interest in the first place.  That 

sentence can't reasonably be understood to say 

anything about due process where, as here, the 

substantive Alabama law confers an additional 

interest that then gives rise to new due process 

requirements. 

With respect to the second sentence 

that you quoted, first of all, that was just 

referring back to the first sentence from part 

2, which, again, doesn't apply here.  In that 

second -- in the third part of the -- the Von 

Neumann opinion where that sentence comes from, 

the Court assumed that a protected due process

 That assumption doesn't really make a 

lot of sense doctrinally. You can't have a due 

process interest in a remission proceeding,

 which is essentially a -- like a discretionary

 pardon.

 And, in any event --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That was the

 argument, though, wasn't it? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I'm sorry? 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That was the 

argument, right? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  The -- the court 

assumed there that there was a due process 

interest.  But I'm saying the -- the assumption 

doesn't even really hold because you can't have 

a due process interest in that kind of a 

discretionary proceeding. 

And, beyond that, again, the -- the 

argument that the Court actually addressed in 

the Von Neumann opinion was about a final 

determination.  It was about the speed to final 

determination in a context where there was no 

substantive right to avoid the forfeiture. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, Mr. Dvoretzky --

 owner defense, and if there were no innocent

 owner defense, there wouldn't be a right to a

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think, if there 

were no innocent owner defense -- first of all, 

we're -- we're not asking the Court to go beyond 

holding that there is a due process right in a

methodologically, does a court even -- in your 

view, does a court even need to ask the question 

whether a retention hearing is due if there's no

 innocent owner defense?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think it does

 because, even in that context, I think there is 

a difference between the claim about a final

 determination and the speed of the final

 determination in Von Neumann and $8,850 versus 

the interim deprivation that's at issue here. 

But I think it's a lot clearer that 

Von Neumann and $8,850 don't speak to the 

question presented when, as here, you have an 

additional substantive right created by state 

law that wasn't at issue in those earlier cases. 

And as this Court's due process 

jurisprudence makes clear, when states create 

substantive rights, that can also give rise to 

additional due process protections --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But does it even --

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- that are required. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- make sense to ask 

this question?  I mean, you -- you point out 

that Gerstein, rather than Barker, is the more 

apt analogy.  But you don't get a hearing on the

 probable cause determination.

 So you're asking, you know, as the 

state points out, for more process, more robust 

process in this context of civil forfeiture than 

a criminal defendant gets.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  A couple points on

 that, Justice Barrett.

 First of all, the point of our 

reliance on Gerstein is simply to show that even 

in the criminal context, Barker is not the --

the overarching test that applies in all 

circumstances. 

So, even in the criminal context, 

Barker doesn't speak to every constitutional 

issue that could come up having to do even with 

timing.  And just so here, Von Neumann and 

$8,850 don't speak to any potential due process 

claim that could be raised. 

With respect to the argument that --

that under our view, the argument that the state 

makes that property is somehow getting greater 

protection than persons, there's a panoply of 

protections under criminal law that defendants 

get.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think it could

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, Justice Alito, 

first, I do think that reasonably prompt is the 

standard.  The way that the lower courts have 

interpreted that is generally a few weeks. 

We're not asking for the 48-hour standard under

Barrett's question, that is another example of

protection for property than for people --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- what does "a few

 weeks" mean?  I'm sorry to interrupt.  What does

 "a few weeks" mean?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  So the Sixth Circuit

 in the Ingram case recently said two weeks.  In

 New York, for Krimstock hearings, they have to 

happen within 10 business days, so that's two 

weeks as well. 

I don't know that it is a rigid line 

at two weeks. I don't think this Court needs to 

decide a particular day at which it needs to 

happen, but it needs to happen reasonably 

promptly on a scale measured by weeks rather 

than -- rather than months or years, which is 

how civil litigation ordinarily happens. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Are you asking us --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about --

here. I didn't understand us to be answering 

the question how many weeks are necessary, but

 maybe I'm confused.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  No, you understood

 correctly, Justice Jackson.  The question

 presented is simply about which methodology,

 which test applies to determine whether a

 hearing is due.

 JUSTICE JACKSON: And whichever one we 

decide, we could remand it for the lower court 

to actually apply it in this case to determine 

whether or not there was a procedural due 

process violation, correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Absolutely. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So 

getting back to Justice Kagan's question about 

the Barker test, I guess I -- I'm -- I thought 

that Barker was about timing and that there 

were, in fact, various species of due process 

claims that could be made, one of which is about 

how quickly or slowly the government has acted 

to give the procedure that it has said it's 

going to give you.  And that's one kind of 

thing. 

And then, say, another is I'm

contesting the procedures that the government is

 offering.  I think more things need to be done 

with respect to this particular set of

 circumstances.  That's another kind of claim.

 And so I had understood that Barker 

applies to the former when you're complaining

 about timing, and I saw $8,850 and Von Neumann

 to be in that bucket.  And Mathews v. Eldridge

 traditionally applies in the other scenario, 

which is what I thought the claimants were 

making here today. 

Am I looking at this in sort of too 

simplistic a way or -- I guess I'm concerned 

about the suggestion that Barker be applied in a 

situation in which the claim is not about the 

timing. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I think you're looking 

at it correctly, Justice Jackson.  And maybe as 

to the timing question in $8,850, that tracks 

the Barker test, but we're asserting a different 

kind of claim here for --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So why is it 

different? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I didn't 

understand that.  Maybe you could explain.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. Why is it

 different?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The only reason you're 

asking for a retention hearing is to get the car 

back sooner. That's a question about timing. 

They're both questions about timing. Barker set 

one timing rule. The claimants here want 

another timing rule, which is a -- a more 

generous to the claimant timing rule. 

I mean, the -- the -- it's no -- it's 

not process for process's sake.  It's process 

because people are without a car and they think 

that they're entitled to the car and they want 

the car back sooner.  So that too is a timing 

rule, isn't it? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  You can look at it as 

a timing question at a general level.  That 

still doesn't mean that these are the same 

questions.  Take the criminal context for -- as 

-- as an analogy.  You could say that the Barker 

speedy trial right is all about getting to a 

final determination quickly.  You also have a 

separate right under Gerstein to a probable 

cause determination within 48 hours. 

I suppose, in a hypothetical

 situation, where we went from an indictment to a

 trial and a verdict within 48 hours, you would 

say: Well, there's no need in that situation 

for a Gerstein hearing because the superfast

 trial in that situation mooted the separate 

interest in the probable cause determination

 under Gerstein.  That doesn't mean that they

 aren't separate interests.

 So too here. There may -- there's one 

interest in getting to a timely ultimate 

determination. That's what was at issue in Von 

Neumann and $8,850 and for which the Court 

analogized to Barker.  There's a separate 

interest in retaining your property during the 

time that it takes to reach that final 

determination. 

And, again, hypothetically, if you had 

a trial within 48 hours, you wouldn't even have 

to worry about the interim determination.

 stuck back at -- at -- at that and some of the 

questions that you heard early on, which is

that was the case in Alabama.  And -- and I 

understand your client filed for summary 

judgment 13 or 18 months later, whatever, but 

what would have impaired them from -- from 

filing a summary judgment motion on day one? 

It's an innocent owner defense.  They know the 

facts of their ownership of their car and how it 

was misused.

reason for the delay and how it might be fairly

I think this is the case in which to decide how 

to think about that question.  Whether the 

underlying facts involve the facts here in 

Alabama or the facts in Wayne County in the 

Ingram case or the hypothetical that you gave, 

the -- the methodological question about how we 

think about whether a hearing is required, 

whether or not a hearing is ultimately required 

on particular facts, is the same.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  -- for -- for an

 additional hearing.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 I'd like to give you an opportunity to 

respond to the arguments raised I think 

primarily in the brief for the Solicitor General 

that requiring retention hearings at the early 

period that -- that you would will prejudice 

procedures under the civil forfeiture regime. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, Mr. Chief Justice, 

I think that the civil forfeiture -- the federal 

civil forfeiture regime presents different 

issues than the Alabama scheme, and in some 

ways, the federal forfeiture regime is actually 

quite protective of -- of vehicle owners. 

And the -- the principal example that 

I would give of that is that the federal scheme 

has -- under the federal scheme, a claimant is 

entitled to immediate release of the seized

 particular case what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the 

-- the Solicitor General elaborates that there 

are all sorts of procedures necessary to support

 forfeiture that will be compromised by a 

somewhat repetitive hearing or not -- whatever

 the precursor to make the other one repetitive

 is -- that will require either ignoring those 

interests or compromising them, including such 

basic things as preservation of the property 

itself. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So I think those 

interests are ones that can be addressed in 

connection with the sort of retention hearing 

that a Mathews analysis might lead to. 

If the government is concerned about 

preservation of the property, that is something 

that a judge can deal with either potentially by 

requiring a bond in a particular case, by 

entering an order prohibiting the disposition of 

the -- of the property.  If the government 

believes that the property is actually evidence 

relevant to the underlying crime, that's 

something that can be addressed in an ex parte

 Justice Thomas, anything further? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  The -- in -- in 

Neumann, a -- there was a petition for 

remission.  How similar is your retention to 

that? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  It -- it -- it is 

fundamentally different because the petition for 

remission is essentially -- it -- it's like a 

request for a pardon. The petition for 

remission, the premise of that is that the 

government has the right to keep the -- the 

property, but the claimant is -- is asking for 

-- for mercy, for forgiveness, essentially. 

At a retention hearing, what would be 

assessed is, first, as we were discussing 

earlier, what is the government's probable --

 second, apart from that, and -- and along the

 lines of what I was discussing with the Chief

 Justice, what -- what might be the government's

 interest in retaining the property anyway?

 Or what might be the government's 

interest in otherwise ensuring that the

 property, even if the -- the owner gets it back,

 is still available at the end of the forfeiture 

proceeding should it be needed? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I understand 

that, but it seems as though the -- a 

proceeding, short of the forfeiture proceedings 

determination in Neumann, the Court said it was 

unnecessary to sustain constitutional stature of 

the forfeiture.  It wasn't -- you did not need 

that intervening process of remission. 

I don't -- and I don't see how that's 

different from your intervening retention 

proceeding. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Thomas, I 

think it's because, in Von Neumann, you had the 

remission proceeding, but the remission 

proceeding was entirely discretionary, whereas,

substantive right that owners have to retain

 their cars if they are innocent, and it's that

additional due process protections needed to

that it's not discretionary.  What if it were

MR. DVORETZKY:  If Alabama -- just to

are an innocent owner, then the state may let

we're not actually asking you to recognize that.

Petitioners' rights by failing to provide a

 retention hearing.  Anyway, assume that that is

 part of the question.  Go ahead.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  So, in terms of what a

 retention hearing looks like, I think the -- the

 Legal Aid Society brief describes how these 

hearings have worked for 20 years in New York.

 In New York, it's a hearing that 

happens within, again, 10 business days, so a 

couple of weeks, at the request of the innocent 

owner. It is a process -- it is a hearing at 

which there are brief opening and closing 

arguments, and there can be evidence presented, 

there can be witnesses. 

At the end of that, the -- the -- the 

adjudicator will decide, is there probable 

validity for retaining the property, and, 

second, what are the government's interests in 

retaining the property during the pendency of 

the forfeiture proceedings? 

Now, to address the government's 

concerns about evidence disappearing or evidence 

potentially being actually evidence in the 

underlying crime, those -- ex parte proceedings 

with the decisionmaker, with the judge, are an

available tool in that situation to address the

 government's interests.

 So, if the government comes in and 

says this car might actually be evidence in the

 underlying drug crime, they'd probably be

 allowed to keep it in that situation and that's

 something that could be addressed ex parte.  The 

due process standard is flexible, including to 

protect the government's interests. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well -- well, let's 

just take what might be sort of a typical case. 

So a car, similar to the facts in -- in one of 

these cases, that a car is stopped by the 

police, they find a large quantity of meth in 

the car, the person driving the car is not the 

owner of the car, the person driving the car is 

the spouse or domestic partner of the owner. 

And then, within a short period of 

time, there's this innocent owner defense, and 

the owner of the car, I suppose, testifies, I 

had no idea this was going on. And then what do 

you think the -- the state -- what -- what do 

you think it is reasonable to require the state 

to do in that situation?

owner of the car. And, by the way, the owner of

 the car would have provided that testimony under 

penalty of perjury. If they're later determined 

not to have been an innocent owner, then

 providing that testimony could subject them to

 additional prosecution just for that.  So in --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does -- does that

 happen in New York City, perjury prosecutions 

under those circumstances?  Do you know of cases 

like that? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I don't know of 

cases like that, but I would also assume that 

people are not going to perjure themselves at 

the innocent owner hearing. But, if -- if 

the -- the owner comes forward and testifies, 

this is my car and I had no idea about the 

wrongdoing, the government would have the chance 

to cross-examine them. 

The government would have a -- a few 

weeks in which to have conducted whatever 

investigation they want to conduct.  They would 

have the opportunity to make a case that way.

the judge, again, perhaps ex parte, we're in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Sotomayor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Bad facts make bad 

law, and I fear we may be headed that way. 

Justice Gorsuch started with the right 

question.  We know there are abuses of the 

forfeiture system.  We know it because it's been 

documented throughout the country repeatedly of 

the incentives that police are given to seize 

property to keep its value as opposed to issues 

of probable cause or issues of legitimacy of the 

seizure, okay?

We also know that that incentive has 

often led to months, if not years, of retention 

of property that ultimately gets returned to the

 owner because there was either no probable cause

 or because of the innocent owner defense.

 So the question before us is, if we 

make a determination to take the dicta in Von 

Neumann and in the 8-8 whatever case, all right, 

to say that's the entire process you're ever 

due, do we leave open the possibility that there 

are states, jurisdictions that are abusing this 

process and not leaving us any arms to correct 

it? That's what we're doing, isn't it? 

If we say there's no overriding first 

question, is this process, the features of this 

process, are they enough, whether it's under 

Mathews or Barker, then what we're basically 

saying is go at it, states, take as much 

property as you want, keep it as long as you 

want, let's hold out no hope whatsoever that 

there's ever going to be any further process 

that's due? 

That's the bottom line, right? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think that's 

right, Justice Sotomayor.  And I think that the

 MR. DVORETZKY:  That -- that's right.

 I -- I -- I do think that there are -- there are 

explanations for the timeline that took place in 

this case, but the Court doesn't need to reach 

that. All the Court needs to decide here is 

that Von Neumann and $8,850, as you say, Justice 

Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There --

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- didn't foreclose 

any and all potential due process claims that 

one might bring, and Mathews is the way to think 

about whether additional process is due in this 

context. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, after 

Krimstock, there are jurisdictions that have 

looked at -- at these issues under the Mathews 

test and not required retention hearings, 

correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Right. A retention --

there -- there are different ways in which 

states might potentially satisfy due process.

know, how does Mathews work in this context?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Kagan, I think 

it does apply at a more categorical level, and 

that, in fact, is one of the advantages of 

Mathews over Barker, is that it can apply at a 

more categorical level and provide some guidance

 to the states, whereas Barker is inherently 

retrospective and looks just at the 

individualized delay in one particular case. 

The categorical level at which I think 

Mathews applies, it would make sense to think of 

it about car owners in jurisdictions with an 

innocent owner defense.  I think that's --

that's the level at which it applies. 

But it's not a nationwide rule that 

would require a precise copy of Krimstock 

hearings in all 50 states.  It would allow 

flexibility for states under Mathews to come up 

with different ways to potentially satisfy the 

due process guarantee. 

Again, the question is, is there a due 

process -- is there a due process question even 

to ask?  And Mathews tells us that there is.

Justice Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Just on that 

methodological question again, the other side,

 of course, emphasizes precedent, but they also 

say that what process is due can't just be a

 policy question.  And they -- they look as well 

at history and they say that, historically, this 

kind of interim hearing has not been required by

 the federal government or the states.  There 

have been lots of different approaches. 

And they say that even today, Alabama 

is not an outlier.  There are lots of different 

approaches in the states.  The states' amicus 

brief really highlights this.  So they say, if 

we went your way, we would be 

constitutionalizing a policy question that for 

over 200 years has been left with the states and 

the federal government, handled in different 

ways. 

So I just want you to respond to that 

overarching theme that I think is in the 

Solicitor General's brief, in Alabama's brief, 

and the states' amicus brief. 

MR. DVORETZKY: If I could make two 

points in response to that, Justice Kavanaugh.

One, as we've been discussing, our

 rule does -- that -- the application of Mathews

 would allow for some amount of continued 

flexibility by the states. We're not asking the 

Court to dictate a national rule that a

 particular type of hearing is required within a

 particular -- a particular time period.  There

 will still be room for states to -- to 

experiment and to customize what they think is 

an appropriate -- an appropriate time and an 

appropriate kind of hearing or perhaps even a 

substitute for a hearing, like a -- a hardship 

determination that could potentially be made 

based on a -- on a paper filing. So we're 

leaving room for flexibility. 

The second point, with respect to 

history, I don't think the history provides a 

clear answer for us here.  First, at common law, 

property could be forfeited regardless of 

whether the owner was innocent.  The innocent 

owner defense is something that didn't exist at 

common law.  And, again, that gives rise to new 

procedural protections.

denial, historical forfeiture laws were quite

 limited.  They were limited to a few specific 

subject areas, like customs and piracy, where it 

made some sense to think about in rem

 proceedings.  Civil forfeiture today bears

 little resemblance to that.

 As Justice Thomas also pointed out 

there, there's some question about whether, at 

common law, forfeiture was civil or criminal and 

whether it carried the additional protections of 

criminal process. 

At the founding, forfeiture 

proceedings had to move quickly. The IJ brief, 

Institute for Justice brief, explains that 

courts had to rule within 14 days of the filing 

date at common law. And so, again, you didn't 

have this sort of question of months- or 

years-long delays.

the only -- the only last point I was going to

common law was also considered against a 

backdrop that the founders had of distrust to

 civil forfeiture generally based on what the

 British were doing before the revolution.  And

 you think that the history isn't determinative

application of Mathews could lead to a 

conclusion that the state's existing process is

 sufficient, and that no additional process is

 required.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  And, you

 know, I was surprised a little bit, I think, 

about your answer to Justice Thomas about Von 

Neumann and why, if at all, remission is

 different. 

I had thought that it was not because 

it was discretionary.  I thought it was because 

the -- the case seems to make pretty clear that 

it is an administrative alternative to judicial 

forfeiture under the statute at issue in that 

case. 

And so, given that -- you know, the 

owner was complaining about it not happening 

quickly enough.  He chose the option of 

remission rather than forfeiture, and he wanted 

the remission hearing to happen quickly. 

And the Court, I thought, in the 

language that has been quoted, was making a much 

more narrow point, which is just that this 

remission is not a part of the forfeiture 

hearing.  It's not required by due process.  And

so, therefore, you don't have a claim that it 

has to be faster under the Constitution, that,

 really, forfeiture is the -- where due process

 lies in terms of your constitutional rights. 

But, of course, that doesn't tell us what steps

 are necessary in a forfeiture proceeding.

 But, to the extent that this language 

is talking about forfeiture being the only 

thing, I thought it was relative to the 

alternative administrative remission process. 

Am I misreading this? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  No. And -- and I 

don't think we're disagreeing.  I would simply 

add the point that this alternative 

administrative process didn't create any 

substantive rights because it was discretionary 

whether the government would give you back your 

property or not. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  True.  But it's also 

the case, I think from this case, that the court 

then goes on to talk about how remission is not 

a part of forfeiture, how those are two 

different things.  And so the language, I 

thought, was just distinguishing forfeiture from 

remission, as opposed to telling us something

about the nature of forfeiture, that it's only 

the forfeiture hearing and you don't get other 

steps or whatever, which is the way it's being

 read, I think, by your counterparts on the other

 side.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I -- I agree.  I

 think that's -- that's also a -- a -- a relevant 

distinction of Von Neumann here.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me 

finally just ask you about, again, the timing 

and whether -- you know, I think there is 

something to this notion that Barker is about 

timing, but, again, the question remains, isn't 

the claimant in this case making a timing kind 

of argument? 

And I guess I see that, but can you 

help me with the following hypo, and then maybe 

I'll also get the reaction on the other side. 

So, if we have a scenario in which 

everyone agrees that the average time for a 

forfeiture proceeding is, say, six months after 

the seizure, and everybody agrees that that is 

reasonable for due process purposes, Plaintiff 

Number 1 doesn't receive her forfeiture hearing 

until 12 months after the seizure, so her claim

 her the hearing.

 Meanwhile, Plaintiff Number 2 receives 

her hearing in six months, but she claims that 

at some point within those six months there

 should be an opportunity for the court to 

consider whether she should have been allowed to 

keep her car during that interim period.

 She's not complaining about the time. 

Six months is fine.  She got her hearing within 

the six months.  But what she's saying is, while 

you figure out during that six months who owns 

this car, I should keep custody of it during 

that period, and I think we should have that 

adjudicated separately from the forfeiture 

hearing. 

Are those two different things, or are 

they both really about timing? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  No, I think those are 

two different claims.  The -- the first one is 

claiming:  I didn't have a fast enough final 

merits determination. 

The other one is claiming:  Look, the 

final merits determination was fast enough under 

the circumstances, civil litigation takes time,

but I shouldn't be deprived of my property 

during the pendency of that. 

And, again, it -- it's like the

 criminal analogy that I used earlier.  You 

wouldn't say that because you have a speedy 

trial right and that's going to take a year that 

you don't also have a Gerstein right to a prompt

 probable cause determination.

 And in a situation where, 

hypothetically, the trial did happen within a 

matter of days, that might moot the probable 

cause hearing or probable cause determination, 

but it wouldn't mean that conceptually you don't 

have two separate rights.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND G. LaCOUR, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. LaCOUR: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 Forfeiture has been a critical tool

 for deterring crime since before the framing, 

and both history and precedent show what 

post-seizure process is due to those whose 

property has been seized. 

From the Collection Act of 1789 and 

Slocum to $8,850 and Von Neumann, the answer is 

clear. If the forfeiture proceeding is 

instituted and concluded promptly, then the 

forfeiture proceeding without more provides the 

post-seizure hearing required by due process. 

Now Petitioners assert that another 

post-seizure hearing is required, a mini-trial 

mere days or weeks after seizure, and in their 

telling, the federal government and the states 

have been violating fundamental rights for 

centuries with no one noticing until just a few 

years ago. 

But their view cannot be squared with

 history or precedent, and their own cases show 

why a timely forfeiture proceeding is the 

meaningful opportunity to be heard at a

 meaningful time.

 Only the timeliness test embodied in

 Barker v. Wingo accounts for the striking

 diversity among forfeiture cases.  Some will be 

simple and others will involve wide-ranging

 investigations.  Some claimants will vigorously 

press their rights and others will default. 

As long as claimants can appear before 

judges promptly, then judges can strike that 

proper balance in each fact-bound case. 

Now I've heard my friend today say, 

essentially, don't trust judges to be judges. 

And so, instead, they invoke Mathews to have 

federal courts act as legislatures handing down 

new Rules of Civil Procedure for all 50 states 

and the federal government. 

But Barker best accounts for what 

should be the dispositive fact in these cases. 

The Petitioners were before state courts within 

two weeks of seizure, yet they ignored that 

process for over a year.  Petitioners received 

all the process they were due, and this Court

 therefore should affirm.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But you -- you

 criticize the use of Mathews, but Barker is a 

Speedy Trial Act case, so that would seem to 

also be an ill fit for determining whether or 

not you should have an additional hearing.

 MR. LaCOUR: I don't think so, Your 

Honor. In $8,850, the Court considered multiple 

ways to measure speed.  And the Barker factors 

are exactly the sorts of factors you imagine any 

judge would look to whether or not Barker had 

ever been decided.  How long has this taken? 

Why has it taken so long? Is the claimant 

pushing her rights?  And has there been any 

prejudice? 

So I -- I think it makes sense why 

$8,850 adopted that test.  And I don't think 

Petitioners have asked for it to be set aside in 

this case.  So it should not be --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think --

MR. LaCOUR: -- cast aside. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- it seems that 

Petitioner is not talking as much about a timing 

issue as whether or not there should be an

 additional right vindicated.  And Barker seems

 to focus on timing as opposed to whether the 

additional right exists at all.

 MR. LaCOUR: That's right, Your Honor.

 But I -- I think one advantage of Barker is that

 it -- it really draws from history.  If you look 

at $8,850, they looked back to Slocum, that 1817 

decision from this Court where the Court

 recognized that while probable cause is enough 

to justify seizure and retention until trial, 

the individual's right is best protected by 

forcing the government into court. 

And if the case is instituted 

promptly, then the judge can decide what it 

takes to move that case along promptly, 

balancing the government's interests in accuracy 

and its other interests with the claimant's 

interest in a speedy --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But you seem to be 

-- you seem to be suggesting that there is no 

other kind of claim that can be made related to 

forfeiture other than its timing.  And I guess 

I'd have you react to the hypothetical that you 

heard me provide to your counterpart.

it's really the same question.  The -- the way 

Ms. Vasquez in $8,850 teed up her claim was 

whether or not she was receiving a hearing at a

 meaningful time.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Not in $8,850.  I'm

 talking about in this case.  $8,850 were -- I --

I agree with you that --

MR. LaCOUR: Right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- $8,850 and Von 

Neumann were both about the timing --

MR. LaCOUR: Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- because the Court 

says in, you know, almost -- in the first 

sentence of Von Neumann that this is about the 

36-month delay. 

But are you saying that that's the 

only type of procedural due process violation 

that can occur with respect to civil forfeiture? 

MR. LaCOUR: I think that's what the 

Court held, Your Honor.  Again, the -- the 

interest is the same, having the car and not 

being temporarily deprived of the vehicle.  And 

that was what --

JUSTICE JACKSON: No, not being 

permanently deprived of the vehicle is different

 Or I get it in front of a kangaroo

 court, and -- and -- and the judge turns out to

 it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

 Those would all be due process issues

 obviously so in order to retain the property for 

the coffers of the state.

 And I think Justice Sotomayor's

 concerned that we are not -- if -- if we go down 

the Barker road and just focus on timing, we're 

losing that capacity to address those cases.

 Am I putting it fairly?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're putting it

 fairly. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Long-windedly but 

fairly, I hope. 

MR. LaCOUR: A couple points.  There's 

no -- just as in $8,850, there's no argument 

that the final hearing they received here was a 

kangaroo court or was not in any way sufficient. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  For sure. 

MR. LaCOUR: And so --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But could those 

claims -- are -- you acknowledge there might be 

claims like that to be had? 

MR. LaCOUR: There may be, Your Honor. 

I think Barker answers them.  If you're 

requiring someone to reach Sam between 3:00 and

MR. LaCOUR: Yes.  Your Honor --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- we have to avoid.

 MR. LaCOUR: -- because, in $8,850 and 

in Von Neumann, the final hearing was going to

 be by a federal judge.  You can trust that they 

are going to uphold the Constitution, they're

 going to do justice.  You -- we shouldn't craft 

a test that suggests otherwise. 

Similarly here, the final hearing is 

going to be in front of a state circuit court 

judge. So we're not dealing with the kangaroo 

court scenario.  I think that's -- that's far 

removed. 

Now you might have that in the 

administrative law context, like in the Social 

Security context, and that's where Mathews might 

be a useful test if you're writing on a blank 

slate, but, here, we're dealing with a process 

as well as the country, two litigants coming 

into court in front of a judge and adjudicating 

their case. 

And -- and that's why Barker is enough 

in that context, because the judge is going to

they're all how long is it going to take until I 

can get an adjudication so that I can get my car

 back, and that's what they're all about.  That's 

why people want this retention hearing, because 

it takes too long, even under Barker, to have

 the final adjudication.  I want it back more

 quickly.  Totally right.

 But we, in fact, have not decided this

 precise question.  We have a couple of sentences 

which were written broadly and, if taken 

literally, would -- would answer the case.  But, 

in fact, the two cases that we had were about 

different kind of procedures at a different time 

in the process. 

And so we could say that even though 

this -- there are similarities here, this 

remains open to us to decide whether there ought 

to be, in addition to the Barker -- the Barker 

limited final adjudication, this -- this kind of 

retention hearing that -- that applies to the 

interim period. 

And I think Justice Sotomayor raises a 

very important point, which is that we know a 

lot more now than we did when $8,850 and the 

other case were decided about how civil

forfeiture is being used in some states, about 

the kinds of abuses that it's subject to, about 

the kind of incentives operating on law

 enforcement officers that -- that tend toward

 those abuses.

 So -- so, if we look around the world 

and we think there are real problems here and 

those problems would be solved if you got a

 really quick probable cause determination, why 

shouldn't we do that? 

MR. LaCOUR: Well, Your Honor, I would 

advise you to stay within the record of the case 

and the controversy that's in front of you right 

now, where you can see ample process was 

provided to these claimants.  We have -- you 

mentioned the bond that they could have posted 

at any time to get the vehicles back. 

And as you were noting earlier with my 

friend on the other side, they're essentially 

just asking to have the final hearing two, three 

weeks after, and that's going to cause serious 

problems for the government. 

You -- you will gain speed, but you 

will lose accuracy.  And the stakes are -- are 

very high in the civil forfeiture context.  The

 obtaining full forfeiture.  We have a strong 

interest as well in -- in making sure that crime

 doesn't pay.

 And so, if you have a less accurate

 retention hearing -- and that's really the only

 reason to have one, is to have a mini-trial 

that's less accurate but is faster -- then 

you're going to have more property released to 

-- to criminals, it's going to potentially be 

misused again, crime will pay more, and you will 

have more crime. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm sorry. 

Why? First of all, I doubt very much that 

criminal defendants from whom cars have been 

taken are going to seek a retention hearing 

because whatever they say will be used against 

them in the criminal case. I don't think New 

York's experience reflects the use of these 

retention hearing by criminals or by people from 

whom the goods have been taken that are tied to 

criminal activity. 

These cases are most important for one 

group of people, innocent owners, because they 

are people who claim they didn't know about the

 parents with young -- with teenage or

 close-to-teenage children involved in drug 

activity. The ones that don't may involve

 spouses or friends.

 And I assume, in many of these 

hearings, to the extent that a person is 

involved in drug dealing, that the government 

pretty quickly will find out or not find out if 

that person has a relationship to a home or 

other place where drugs are being stored, 

distributed, et cetera, and the government can 

do what your opposing counsel said, ex parte 

hearing saying this is a wife who claims she's 

an innocent owner, but we have evidence that 

there's drug dealing going on from the home, 

it's unlikely she's an innocent owner.  If it's 

someone who's unrelated and no continuing 

relationship, et cetera. 

So you're talking about criminals get

majority -- I -- I believe the statistic was 

very high -- certainly, over 60 percent of 

innocent owners win, it is not criminals keeping 

cars. It's innocent owners receiving back their

 MR. LaCOUR: Your Honor, there --

there may be circumstances where Barker needs to 

be applied with more teeth, but I don't think

 that means it's not up to the task.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but why

 don't you see the Mathews factors as that more

 teeth? Mathews is just more explicit of adding 

in the -- I guess, in this case, the 

Petitioners' factors.  Barker seems to be with 

timing and seeing who caused the timing, what 

were the government's interests. 

The governmental interest is always 

going to be great, but where does Barker take 

into account the hardship of the individual?

 a criminal proceeding in place.  The people who 

come in are the people who are innocent owners.

 MR. LaCOUR: Your Honor, I think a --

a claim like that would need to come from my 

friends and would need to be backed up with --

with evidence. And it's not uncommon, as this

 Court has -- as courts have recognized, that 

criminals oftentimes do put title of property in 

someone else's name, and that someone else can 

come forward.  Not every purportedly innocent 

owner is innocent, and not everyone is even an 

owner. 

And this is another problem with 

rushing this hearing, is that someone could come 

forward and claim ownership but not actually 

have proper ownership.  And if it's happening 

too quickly, then the actually innocent owner 

may be out his property and it's not going to be 

there at the final forfeiture hearing, which is 

why the government has always had this authority 

to seize before a hearing, and the same 

interests that have long justified seizure 

before a hearing justify not turning the stuff 

back over immediately after the seizure but,

you to respond to Petitioners' argument that the 

historical analogs are not actually analogous 

here and that we don't have any settled

 tradition of having a single forfeiture hearing?

 MR. LaCOUR: I -- I would expect to

 have seen a mini-trial or a remission -- or not 

remission -- a retention hearing somewhere in 

the history, but we do not have that. And if 

you contrast that with the liberty interest, 

Justice Scalia's dissent in County of Riverside 

highlights how there always was this right at 

common law to be presented to the magistrate 

right after the arrest. 

But there's not similar evidence when 

it comes to property, and that's because 

property and liberty are very different.  The 

liberty interest --

property that arise and there are new kinds of

 So, you know, do we -- what do we do 

then if we think there is no precise analog?

 MR. LaCOUR: If it -- if -- I think 

you're still speaking in the language of speed,

 which is the language of Barker, which is,

 again, why we think Barker is the test. It is

 the historical test.  It carries that forward to 

today, institute promptly, conclude promptly, 

and then let the judges who are on the ground 

with the parties in front of them weigh those --

weigh those competing interests. 

And when it comes to this affirmative 

defense of innocent ownership, I don't think 

that changes things at all.  It's actually very 

similar to the argument that Mr. Von Neumann 

made. He said he had an independent interest in 

this remission petition.  And the Court did 

assume for purposes of deciding part 3 that he 

did. And the Court said, we don't see how that 

separate interest, apart from the cars, is in 

any way prejudiced by this 36-day wait.

an affirmative defense is prejudiced not at all 

by being held or being heard for the first time 

at the final hearing as opposed to two weeks

 after seizure or two days after seizure for that

 matter.

 And if you look to the criminal 

context, there are affirmative defenses there 

that typically don't get heard until the

 criminal trial.  So, clearly, affirmative 

defenses can be meaningful even if they don't 

get put before a court until the final hearing. 

And the same thing is true in the civil context. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I'm sorry, what is 

the affirmative -- what -- what is -- your 

conception of this -- the interest that this 

Petitioner is raising is the ability to make her 

affirmative defense early?  I don't understand 

where affirmative defense came from. 

MR. LaCOUR: They say that this case 

is somehow different because there's now an 

innocent owner affirmative defense, but, I mean,

 1970s. 

So going back to her question, which 

is, if the common law doesn't have a clearly

 established process, does that mean no process 

is ever due, or does it mean that we have to

 judge it by the circumstances that exist in 

modern times? I would think it's the latter.

 MR. LaCOUR: You --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And forfeitures 

were quicker earlier in our history. 

Forfeitures were rare. And now we've expanded 

them to all sorts of property interests.  Even 

those involving innocent owners, it's a new 

thing. So what do we do with a -- without a 

clear common law analog? 

MR. LaCOUR: Your Honor, I think the 

history is a lot clearer and a lot clearer in 

our favor than the Restore the Fourth brief 

would make out.  We agree with a lot of the 

premises that in Slocum and I think there's an 

early Judge Hand decision saying you need to 

institute or return.

 General in particular suggests that those really

 Do you agree with that or not?

 MR. LaCOUR: We see a little more 

daylight between the tests, but we -- we do

 agree that in -- in these cases, they would cash 

out the same way.  That's what the Southern 

District of Alabama held in Ms. Culley's case, 

that under Mathews or under Barker, she loses.

have no precedent on point and suppose we have 

no idea what the history says, just a complete 

blank slate.  We're purely -- and suppose we're 

doing Mathews v. Eldridge, okay?  We're purely

at the significant interests the government has 

in not having to try their case repeatedly. And

 it's -- it's bolstered in the forfeiture context

 because, again, movable property can disappear.

 It can be hidden.  It can be misused again.

 You don't want to turn the car back 

over to someone who's just allowed it to be used 

to traffic methamphetamine because odds are 

there's at least better than zero odds that it 

might be misused again or disappear. 

So we think the government's interests 

are -- are -- are very strong here.  And then 

it -- it's not clear what additional process is 

really going to be provided when that retention 

hearing is going to look a lot like the final 

hearing except for the fact that it's going to 

be rushed and, therefore, the risk of error is 

going to increase. 

And then that risk of error is not 

just a problem for the public, it's a problem 

for the other actually innocent owners if a 

merely purportedly innocent owner makes off with 

the property because of the error.

part of the problem with Mathews. And it -- it 

-- it's not all that predictable. The Second 

Circuit and the Seventh Circuit just in the

hearing.  The Fifth Circuit and the Southern

get a retention hearing for cars.

 would see that as a drawback.  I think that's 

actually a merit of Barker.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  More fact-sensitive 

than the factors in Mathews?

 MR. LaCOUR: Yes.  Petitioners' 

counsel said just a few moments ago that Mathews 

allows you to do these categorical projections

 into what the typical case is going to look like 

in the future so that trial judges can be told, 

make sure you have a hearing within 14 days no 

matter what the facts show you. 

And we don't think that's very 

flexible at all. We would prefer a test that 

allows trial judges to be trial judges and weigh 

the cases as they come. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  So you're 

saying even though you -- your argument is that 

both Barker and Mathews come out the same way 

here, somehow, in application, Mathews has --

is -- is deficient vis-à-vis Barker?  Barker is 

the better, easier way to -- what -- what is 

better about it?

forfeiture context are going to be alike. You

 have lots of different types of property. Even

Circuit has been to really alter the Rules of 

Civil Procedure for every case going forward,

the Barker test that is more determinate -- more 

determinative, allows us to be more predictable 

about what's going to happen, other than, I 

guess, the view that you'll never get any other 

process?  If that's -- if that's the result that

MR. LaCOUR: Yes, and I think it's --

it's a little more specific in describing the

 government interests.  The government has to 

explain why there is a delay. And then you're

 looking at the -- the key factor, which is how

 long has this taken.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So just,

 finally, getting back to Justice Gorsuch's 

point, is it your argument that plaintiffs are 

not allowed in this context -- by that, I mean 

the civil forfeiture context generally -- to 

assert that the forfeiture procedures themselves 

are deficient?  Not making a delay claim.  I'm 

conceding, says the plaintiff, that this was not 

-- that the forfeiture hearing is going to 

happen or has happened in a timely fashion.  But 

I would like to complain about the procedures 

that were given to me in that context. 

Is it your view that -- that no such 

claim can be made? 

MR. LaCOUR: Your Honor, if the claim, 

for example, was that the judge who's sitting 

over my case is biased against me --

because that's hard and it'll go back to the

 question that Justice Gorsuch asked.

 I want to make it something else about

 the process that is unfair.  You know, these

 involve, as Justice Sotomayor says, people who

 are -- say that they're innocent owners, that 

they own the property and that they knew nothing

 about the drugs. 

So the state has a system -- this is a 

hypothetical I'm making up on the spot. The 

state has a system in which the manner of 

proving that the person, you know, knows about 

the drugs is very unfair.  You know, the -- the 

state says we presume that if you are -- you 

know, know this individual, then you're aware of 

their drug activity.  And since this person is 

your son, you obviously know them.  You can't

know anything about it.  You're not an innocent 

owner under that test. 

And what the person, the -- the owner, 

would like to do is say that you can't have a 

system -- you can't have a -- a method of proof 

that is so unfair in terms of my ability to 

prove that I didn't know what was going on.

That's my challenge, not that the hearing took

 too long.  It has nothing to do with speed.  I 

want to make that kind of challenge.

 My question is, is it your view that 

no such claims exist? And if they do exist, are 

we judging the due process by the Barker test or 

some other test in that situation?

 MR. LaCOUR: Your Honor, I think this 

Court's decision in District Attorney's Office 

v. Osborne would suggest that if you've created 

a new procedural right, then, yes, there's some 

due process protections that attach, but the 

state has a -- a tremendous amount of discretion 

in terms of what processes are going to attach 

to that new --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Understood.  So --

MR. LaCOUR: -- procedural right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- if you agree that 

the person could make such a claim, are you 

saying the Barker test would apply in that 

situation to determine the -- the ultimate due 

process question? 

MR. LaCOUR: It doesn't sound like 

that's a timing issue, so probably not, Your 

Honor, but, again, in -- in this case, the issue

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE F. REAVES 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. REAVES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

I think it may be helpful for me to 

lay out how the federal government sees this 

case. In our view, the Court has already found, 

as indicated in $8,850 and Von Neumann, that the 

only process a claimant is entitled to after 

personal property is seized is a timely final 

forfeiture hearing. 

If this Court is of the view that it 

has not yet addressed that issue, it should now, 

and it should hold that a claimant has no right 

to an interim post-seizure hearing. 

History and tradition support that

rule. At the time of the founding, there was no 

right to an early hearing when property was

 seized.  Only a timely forfeiture hearing was

 required.  That approach has prevailed for

 nearly 250 years.

           The hearings that Petitioners request

 would upend that history, be extremely onerous, 

and would require more process for the pretrial 

deprivation of property than the pretrial 

detention of persons. 

Finally, if the government disagrees 

with our front-line position, while we think 

that $8,850 is the better fit for Petitioners' 

particular claims, the government is largely 

ambivalent about whether Eldridge or $8,850 

applies to determine whether an interim hearing 

is required in a given case. 

But, either way, this Court's decision 

should emphasize that the public and government 

interests identified in $8,850 and Pearson Yacht 

will often weigh strongly against allowing such 

a hearing. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Reaves, there's 

-- there have been quite a few questions that

say maybe something substantively goes wrong in 

this process. How would you address that, 

assuming that the forfeiture proceedings are

 timely?

 MS. REAVES: So I think, if there was

 some sort of question that an individual wasn't

 receiving due process in the course of the

 proceedings, so some sort of procedural

 irregularity, I think there could be a due 

process claim for that. 

It wouldn't necessarily be by --

governed by Eldridge or even $8,850.  It could 

be governed by just the closest, you know, civil 

law analogy.  Like, if there's an inappropriate 

burden of proof being placed on someone, I think 

that there might be due process analogies for 

that. 

But that wouldn't be solved by 

requiring an additional layer of proceedings in 

all cases or in a significant category of cases. 

That's just a different issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The assessment 

whether a civil forfeiture proceeding meets the 

requirements of due process, timeliness is a 

significant consideration in that, right?

MS. REAVES: Yes, it is. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it is, of 

course, in retention as well?

 MS. REAVES: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- but 

there's presumably a gap between when you would 

have that question asked under retention and 

when you would have it asked under civil 

forfeiture. How do we look at the significance 

of that -- that gap? 

MS. REAVES: So I think the Court 

would look at that under $8,850 because $8,850 

allows the Court to take into consideration the 

burden to a particular claimant in a particular 

case. I think that comes in under the first 

factor in $8,850. 

And I think, you know, the government 

interests really aren't any different.  You 

know, this Court's talked about the government 

interests in Pearson Yacht in not having a 

pre-seizure hearing. And I think most of those 

government interests continue to apply to allow 

the government -- and -- to retain the property 

while the hearing is proceeding, you know, as 

long as the hearing is proceeding in an

isn't sitting on its hands and doing nothing

 while holding someone's property.

 And I -- and I think the history and

 tradition really are consistent with that.  You

 know, the best evidence of the history here

 comes from the Collection Acts, which were

 passed by founding-era Congresses.  There was no 

requirement that there be any sort of interim 

hearing.  The normal rule was that once property 

was seized, it was held until the final 

forfeiture hearing. 

And Petitioners' counsel has suggested 

that once the forfeiture proceeding was filed, 

there was a 14-day hearing requirement.  That's 

just not the case.  So, first of all, under the 

Collection Acts, the federal government had up 

to three years between seizure and initiating 

the forfeiture action.  And then --

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Sorry to interrupt. 

Do we need to decide any of that in this case 

given that under your count and the state's, the 

Petitioner here was -- could have brought a 

summary judgment motion at any time and -- and, 

presumably, most of the facts that she would

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, how would it

view if we were to say -- want to avoid ruling

 on -- on that question and also leave open the 

possibility, as you alluded to with Justice 

Thomas, that there may be due process 

considerations beyond timing that might arise in 

some of these cases? 

I mean, there are allegations before 

us that in some states, because law enforcement 

uses these -- these forfeitures to fund 

themselves, that they sometimes require somebody 

who wants some of their property back to agree 

to give some of it to the government or engage 

in other concessions outside of regular process. 

How -- how do we write a narrow opinion that 

does no harm here? 

MS. REAVES: So I think the Court 

could say that we haven't decided whether 

there's ever any entitlement to an interim

requirement in some category of cases, it

 clearly would not -- Petitioners were not 

entitled to that sort of hearing in this

 particular case.

 Now there may be some dangers in

 kicking it down the road.  I think there will be

 other petitions coming up because of the Sixth

 Circuit's decision and even coming out of 

Krimstock.  But the Court definitely could save 

this for another day if the Court wanted to. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I -- I thought you 

were going to say that the -- that we could say 

that there's no due process right to an interim 

hearing, period, but there could be other due 

process issues related to other aspects of 

forfeiture proceedings and you don't need to 

rule those problems out by saying there's no due 

process right to an interim hearing. 

MS. REAVES: That's certainly our 

preferred rule.  I think I was assuming that 

Justice Gorsuch wanted a much more limited rule 

that just dealt with the facts of this case. 

But, as I said in my opening, we certainly think 

that the Court has already indicated that

 MS. REAVES: So I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, Barker, a

 defendant comes in -- not a defendant -- a 

petitioner comes in, makes a motion and says, 

I'm entitled to a Barker hearing.  The 

government claims its interests, but I have 

hardship and I want a hearing on the level of my 

hardship versus their interests and their level 

of proof? 

Because your brief seems to argue that 

the Mathews test is fully consistent would --

with and would not require any material changes 

in the Court's traditional Barker-based 

analysis.  That's your brief at page 19. 

MS. REAVES: So I think I want to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So due process 

does require Barker hearings.  That's what we 

said in $8,850, and, basically, you just don't

MS. REAVES: So I think I want to be

 clear where we are in the analytical framework

 here. So we don't think there's ever a right to

 an interim hearing.  We think the only right 

that there is is a timely final forfeiture

 hearing.

 And it's certainly true that someone

 whose forfeiture proceedings are ongoing can 

say: Look, this is moving too slowly under 

Barker, and the court can, you know, set its 

deadlines accordingly, can dismiss the case if 

it's already proceeded for too long a period of 

time. 

And we've also suggested that in this 

particular case, where the claims really are 

just about timing, you know, Petitioners haven't 

alleged there wasn't due process to seize their 

vehicles, they haven't complained with the time 

-- final proceeding, they concede in their reply 

that sometimes a final forfeiture hearing could 

happen quickly enough, that when the claim 

really is about timing, that there's going to be 

little difference between applying $8,850 or 

Barker to that type of claim.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep saying

 "timely."  I don't know what timely is. I have 

a brief that set out the fact that some 

hearings, by the nature of what the courts are 

doing, are taking up to a year or more.

 I don't consider that timely if I'm an 

innocent owner who relies on my car for my --

for survival.  And there's evidence of claimants 

who, in fact, had children, who lost their job, 

et cetera. 

So how do we take care of those 

things? 

MS. REAVES: So I think, if you're 

concerned about that sort of thing, the claimant 

can raise the concern that the proceedings are 

already taking too long in their ongoing 

forfeiture proceedings or, if the forfeiture 

proceedings haven't been filed, they can file a 

Rule 41(g) motion in the federal system or a 

Rule 313 motion in the Alabama system. 

So there are ways to bring the 

timeliness claim up to a court without requiring 

a retention hearing in all cases. And I think 

one important thing to keep in mind, you know, 

Petitioner has focused extensively on the fact

here and that that somehow means that there's an 

earlier entitlement to a hearing.  And Alabama 

law, the version of law that was in effect for 

this case, makes it clear that that is an

 affirmative defense.

 That's in Wallace versus State, which

owner defense that's at issue here only comes in 

after the state has made out its prima facie

system as it exists, that Alabama puts in a 

system that is much fairer?

 That was one of the reasons that

 Alabama resisted granting cert in this case, 

because the new system does look to guarantee a

 faster process?

 MS. REAVES: So I think the new 

system's processes are different, but I think 

it's important to keep in mind that I don't even 

think the new system's process would have given 

these Petitioners faster process. 

So the innocent owner defense under 

Alabama's new law, once an innocent owner seeks 

-- seeks an innocent owner hearing, the state 

has up to 60 days to respond to that.  And 

that's almost exactly the amount of time that 

Petitioners would have had their cars returned 

to them had they proceeded under Alabama state 

law as it had existed at the time of this case.

Justice Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, can I just

 clarify one thing?  You -- you say that you 

think that the only right is to a timely final

 forfeiture hearing, but I thought what was at

 issue in this case is the test that is to be 

used to make that determination. So I 

appreciate that the government thinks it knows 

the answer in all of these cases, which is, you 

don't get a hearing.  But I thought this -- that 

the -- I thought we had tests that we applied in 

the law to lead us to that conclusion in 

particular cases depending upon the claims and 

the circumstances. 

And so our question was what test?  Am 

-- am I wrong?  It -- it -- it feels to me 

strangely like the government has picked the 

answer and is choosing the test that will 

inevitably lead to the answer that the 

government wants, as opposed to telling us here 

is the difference between the Barker test and 

the Mathews test and which one is better in 

terms -- more consistent with our prior case 

law, et cetera, et cetera?

MS. REAVES: So I think we view the

 answer to the question presented as being it 

doesn't matter because the Court has essentially 

already decided this in Von Neumann, in $8,850.

 And I --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What's your -- what

 is -- what is your view of my thought that Von 

Neumann is really much narrower in the language 

that you're talking about than your -- than 

the -- than the way it is being read, that it's 

been taking -- taken out of context? 

MS. REAVES: So I think Von Neumann, 

the latter part of that decision, I -- I read it 

as having assumed that there was a due process 

right to a timely remission -- adjudication of 

the remission petition.  And then the Court 

there found that --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  You mean in Section 

3? 

MS. REAVES: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, in Section 2, 

it says there is no such thing, so it's just 

kind of continuing to spin out the analysis, but 

it was pretty clear in 2 that the Court was 

finding that there was no such thing.

MS. REAVES: That -- that's certainly

 correct.  I think the Court had maybe

 alternative holdings that you could -- you could 

say, but I don't think the Court should just

 ignore the last section of -- of Von Neumann.

 But I think even if you were to view 

this case as being, and this issue as not 

already being decided, I think, if you looked at 

it under an $8,850-type analysis or even a 

Mathews v. Eldridge analysis, you'd come to, 

like, the bottom-line conclusion that the Court 

came to in Pearson Yacht for the same reasons 

that there's no entitlement to a pre-forfeiture 

notice and hearing -- or pre -- excuse me, 

procedure notice and hearing. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So the government's 

view is that on the methodology, it doesn't 

really matter whether we do Barker, or, like, 

the answer to the QP is it doesn't matter?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

 Justice.

 First, Von Neumann and $8,850 didn't 

decide the question that is presented here. 

They didn't decide whether there can be an 

interest in avoiding temporary deprivation that

 is different from the time to a final 

disposition. 

The Court in this case should not 

strip the lower courts of the tools they need to 

analyze whether in a particular case more 

process is due. 

We've heard the phrase today "Let 

judges be judges."  The Court -- this Court 

should let judges be judges and trust the lower 

courts as well as the states and the federal 

government to figure out what to do with the 

guidance that this Court should provide that 

some meaningful process is due in order to 

protect an innocent owner pending a final 

adjudication. 

And jurisprudentially, Gerstein again 

is another example here.  In Gerstein, the Court

 recognized that there should be a prompt

 probable cause determination.  It took several

 years of them -- percolation before the Court in 

City of Riverside provided more concrete

 guidance and said:  Okay, this is what that

 needs to look like.

 So all the Court needs to do here is

 to recognize that the interests that we're

 asserting are different than the ones that were 

asserted in Von Neumann and $8,850.  They should 

be analyzed under Mathews because Mathews is the 

test for determining whether additional process 

is due.  And then the lower courts and the 

states and, if necessary, the federal government 

can figure out how that works. 

Now, in terms of some of the 

flexibility that that might afford, the -- the 

federal statute, 18 U.S.C. 983(f), it allows 

the -- the -- or it entitles a claimant to the 

immediate release of seized property if they can 

show substantial hardship.  That is in -- in 

some ways even more valuable than a hearing. 

So that may be perfectly 

constitutionally sufficient.  Utah has a similar 

sort of scheme.  And so, again, the Court

doesn't need to micromanage exactly how all of

 this works.

 With respect to Barker, Barker would

 be a poor fit for the claim that we're asserting 

here because Barker is not designed to answer 

the question of whether more process is due.

 For starters, under the first prong of Barker, 

it takes a year before Barker even kicks in.

 Barker does not account for private 

interests.  It doesn't account, for example, for 

the difference between taking away somebody's 

car, which is necessary for their livelihood, 

and taking away some other piece of property 

that they might not need in the same way. 

Mathews does. 

Barker also provides no flexibility in 

the remedy.  The only remedy that Barker can 

lead to is, in the criminal context, dismissal 

of the indictment, here, dismissal of the 

forfeiture proceeding altogether.  It doesn't 

provide any flexibility for considering whether 

additional process is due. 

With respect to the facts here, no 

Court has considered the value of additional 

process and whether, in fact, the -- the

 plaintiffs could have moved for prompt summary 

judgment and, if so, how long that would have

 taken. What we do know is that in the course of 

ordinary litigation, the state here, to use

 Sutton's case as an example, the state took five 

months to respond to discovery requests about

 what the state knew about the innocent owner

 defense, and, ultimately, those discovery

 requests were entirely non-responsive. 

And so all of this back and forth 

about what could have happened on summary 

judgment, that's something that the lower courts 

can consider in the first instance -- it hasn't 

been considered before -- in applying Mathews 

and determining what would be the value of 

additional process. 

I'd also point out that the facts of 

this case show how different this case looks 

from forfeiture at common law.  This is not a 

case about pirates or owners of ships crossing 

borders.  We're talking here about individuals 

who lost their cars. 

In Sutton's case, as a result of 

losing her car, she missed medical appointments, 

she wasn't able to keep a job, she wasn't able

to pay a cell phone bill and, as a result of

 paying a cell phone bill -- not being able to 

pay her cell phone bill, was not in a position

 to be able to communicate about the forfeiture

 proceedings.

 In Ms. Culley's case, she not only 

begged and pleaded with the police for her car 

back but also had communications with the DA's

 office.  The DA's office said, if you comply 

with our process, you'll get your car back, but 

it'll take at least six months until there's a 

hearing. 

And so we're far removed from the --

the narrow sense in which history recognized 

forfeiture. 

Lastly, Alabama talks about government 

interests here.  Government interests can be 

weighed, in fact, must be weighed as part of the 

Mathews analysis.  They can also be considered 

at any retention hearing that might result from 

Mathews.  Approximately 20 states have hearings 

of some sort like that.  Alabama itself now 

provides a much prompter hearing than it did 

when -- when my clients' cars were taken. 

Lastly, I would just end with a quote

at 407 U.S. 90. "A prior hearing always imposes 

some costs in time, effort, and expense, and it 

is often more efficient to dispense with the

 opportunity.  But these rather ordinary costs

 cannot outweigh the constitutional right."

 We ask that the Court adopt Mathews
