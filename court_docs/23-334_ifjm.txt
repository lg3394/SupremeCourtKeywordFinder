 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-334,

 Department of State versus Muñoz.

 Mr. Gannon.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Last fiscal year, the Department of 

State issued 11 million immigrant and 

nonimmigrant visas.  It also refused 62,000 visa 

applications on the basis of one or more of the 

inadmissibility grounds in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), 

including applications from approximately 5400 

noncitizens seeking to live with their U.S. 

citizen spouses or fiancés. 

Under the doctrine of consular 

nonreviewability, a noncitizen outside the 

United States cannot obtain judicial review of a 

consular officer's denial of a visa.  Congress 

has not provided for that form of review in the 

INA, and when it added new visa-related 

provisions in 2002, it reaffirmed that it was

not providing an end run around that.

 Nor is an end run available when a 

U.S. citizen family member -- here, the

 noncitizen's spouse -- wants the noncitizen to 

be admitted into the United States. As the

 Kerry against Din plurality concluded in 2015, 

that is not a liberty interest protected by the 

Due Process Clause, and the U.S. citizen is 

affected only indirectly by the government's 

action against the noncitizen. 

Thus, Respondent Muñoz cannot 

challenge the denial of her husband's visa 

application any more than she could challenge a 

decision at the end of a removal proceeding that 

he will be removed from the United States or at 

the end of a criminal trial that he would be 

sent to a prison far across the country. 

With respect to the second question 

presented, even assuming that Respondent Muñoz 

has a sufficient constitutional interest to 

trigger any judicial review, the Court should at 

the very least hold that the State Department 

satisfied the Mandel standard.  The consular 

officer provided a facially legitimate and bona 

fide reason by citing a valid statutory ground

of inadmissibility, the unlawful activity bar,

 just as Justice Kennedy's concurrence had found 

had been the case in Din, where the government

 cited the neighboring terrorist activities bar.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Just for

 clarification, would -- if -- assuming that

 Ms. Muñoz does, in fact, have a liberty

 interest, would the consular nonreviewability 

preclude her winning here? 

MR. GANNON: We think that it would. 

We think that the --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And how would that 

work then? 

MR. GANNON: The only potential 

exception there would be if there were a 

constitutional right that this Court has 

recognized, that that would be the only 

potential exception.  We otherwise think that 

the point here is -- of consular 

nonreviewability is that the person whose 

interest is directly at stake doesn't have a 

right to review.  And, a fortiori, it seems that

government's decision in that proceeding also

cannot challenge that.

 And so the second question presented,

 assuming that she has a constitutional interest,

 would be that we at least satisfy what --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I understand

 that. I'm just trying to figure, without even 

getting to Din, whether or not reviewability --

nonreviewability would preclude any -- her 

having any recovery at all, whatsoever, that you 

wouldn't even have to get to Din. 

MR. GANNON: Well, the case has been 

litigated on the presumption that there would be 

an exception to consular nonreviewability if --

if we were to lose on the first QP, and that's 

what Justice Kennedy's concurrence said in Din. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --

MR. GANNON: I don't know what the 

cause of action is --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MR. GANNON: -- that she has in order 

to bring that.  The Ninth Circuit has been 

assuming that there is one, I guess, under the 

-- under the Constitution.  We think there is 

not one under the APA. And none of the courts 

of appeals has found that there is one there.

And so we think that there still would be 

reasons to say that there isn't going to be any 

review even in those circumstances, but at the

 least, we would satisfy Mandel.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, the 

husband has no right of review, you're correct.

 And it's a judicially created exception of

 nonreviewability.  So, if we make an exception, 

it's us excepting something that's not statutory 

or constitutionally required. 

Her point is, whether it's her or her 

husband, they each should have a right to 

dispute whatever basis it was that formed your 

denial.  And let's assume it was something as 

simple or -- as misidentification.  You thought 

he was John Doe, and you had a whole criminal 

record on John Doe.  And he's not John Doe; he's 

John Smith, John Smith Doe, which is another 

person. 

So the reason she's asking for an 

explanation and one that's required is that she 

says: I have a right equal to the Mandel 

professors.  They had a First Amendment right to 

invite a professor to come speak to them.  I 

have an equal constitutional right to live with

 The second question is, is that a

 let's take each of your points, okay?

 As far back as 1888, this Court said 

in Maynard that getting married is something 

more than a mere contract, which is your 

position in your brief, that it's only statutory

 rights or benefits. 

In 1923, this Court described in one 

breath the right "to marry, establish a home, 

and bring up children," and that right is one 

long recognized at common law as essential to 

the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. 

That's our Meyer case. 

In Loving versus Virginia, we said 

marriage is fundamental.  In United States 

versus Windsor, we said "marriage is more than a 

routine classification for purposes of certain 

statutory benefits."  So -- and Obergefell, I'm 

not going to cite it, but it said something to 

that effect. 

So, if I assume that there's a liberty 

interest that has to be protected by some sort 

of process, then the question is, what kind of

process is enough? And in Mandel and in Nken,

 we talk about the statutory -- citing at least a

 statutory basis for exclusion.

 Here, you're saying she's entitled to 

nothing. Why do we have to go that far? Why

 don't we just address, given all of our

 centuries of statements about marriage being

 something more?

 MR. GANNON: We don't disagree that 

marriage is an important right and that she has 

liberty interests that are implicated there. 

To step back to the beginning of your 

question, we think that the doctrine of consular 

nonreviewability is rooted in the political 

branch's plenary power to determine which 

noncitizens should be admitted to the country 

and what procedures are going to be used in 

order to make that determination. 

And so that's not just a judicial 

exception to general principles of 

reviewability.  That's the background against 

which Congress enacted the INA.  It provided for 

certain remedies in review and did not provide 

for this.

MR. GANNON: But, in Din, the Court --

 MR. GANNON: And the constitutionally 

protected liberty interest that she has not 

asserted is a liberty interest in having her 

spouse admitted to the United States.  And we 

think that they need to allege a liberty 

interest that's sufficiently specific and it 

would need to be rooted in history and 

tradition.

Din, even Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I take the point.

 It's -- it's one way to read Mandel, I think

 possibly not the best way, but it's one way to

 read it.  Mandel is a little bit ambiguous on 

that point.  But I think that that's a harder 

and harder argument to make after Trump 

v. Hawaii, which pretty clearly talks about 

Mandel as setting forth a very limited but still 

existent way to review these decisions. 

MR. GANNON: To the extent that Trump 

against Hawaii addressed this, it didn't address 

-- it assumed without deciding that consular 

nonreviewability existed and it said that it --

it quoted with approval Justice Kennedy's 

approach in Din of saying that a statutory 

citation would be enough in this context.

Trump suggests that your first, most dramatic,

that we, in fact, have recognized a kind of

engaged in limited judicial review in a handful

And there's still nobody who has identified what 

the cause of action is here or why this would be 

permissible.  Every time the Court says this, it 

says, well, even assuming you can get review, 

the government has said enough here.  And so we 

do think we would satisfy that standard, and I'm

move fairly quickly to, well, let's assume 

something and then move on to it and as long as 

it leads to the same result, they don't have to 

struggle with the far more difficult question.

the Court moves on to what might be an -- an 

easier question from the point of view of the 

Court in terms of the significance of the -- of

 balancing the strength of the government's

 interests against the constitutional right at

 issue. It says we're not going to test or look 

behind the reason or balance it. That's the 

last paragraph of Mandel. 

And I -- I understand the -- the --

the temptation to say we should decide the easy 

question here because the government actually 

did give more information in this case, but that 

would still leave an entrenched circuit split on 

the first question presented. 

Several circuits have said there is no 

constitutional right in this interest and 

there's not even Mandel review.  Three circuits 

since Din have assumed the first question and 

went on to say that the government satisfied the 

Mandel standard as applied in those cases.  The 

Ninth Circuit is the only circuit on the other 

side that's saying that there is a 

constitutional liberty interest here.

And I do think that assuming that

 means that we're going to have to continue to 

litigate questions over what are the contexts in

 which there's a sufficient liberty interest.  Is

 it a spouse?  Is that enough?  Is it a fiancé?

 Is that enough?  If a parent and child, is that

 enough?  Does it implicate something other than

 visa denials?

 We haven't seen a clean line for 

distinguishing between the circumstances here 

and the circumstances there.  But, if you're in 

QP-2, my basic answer is that there's not 

balancing.  It's just --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What do you think 

is --

MR. GANNON: -- a question of whether 

it's a facially legitimate and bona fide reason. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What is required 

by Mandel in your view and what would be the 

problems from your view in requiring more of an 

explanation? 

MR. GANNON: Well, our -- our basic 

position on the Mandel question here is that the 

statutory citation is good enough, as Justice 

Kennedy concluded in Din, and we think that

that's similar to what the professors were able

 to get in the -- in -- in Mandel to the extent 

that, there, there had to be a reason of some 

kind because, otherwise, it was just blanket 

discretion in the attorney general to grant a

 waiver or not.

 In this context, there's additional 

information that is provided by the citation of 

-- of the statutory kind of inadmissibility. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And why don't you 

spell out -- spell out, because I think it's 

helpful, what would be the problems from the 

government's perspective if more of an 

explanation were required than just the 

statutory citation or -- or --

MR. GANNON: Well, one problem is that 

in cases that involve law enforcement and 

intelligence information, as security-based 

denials like this arise, that there are 

sensitivities about being able to share that 

information.  That is why Congress has expressly 

provided in 1182(b) that the State Department 

doesn't even have to give --

the explanation that you did give later was

 sufficient.  It just wasn't timely.

 And -- and what the government did

 give, if -- if that were sufficient, obviously 

redacted lots of stuff, didn't provide a lot of 

information. You could simply say we think he's

 a member of -- of a gang based on our contacts

 with law enforcement, period. 

So how would that implicate any 

serious governmental interest? 

MR. GANNON: Well, it -- it would --

it would go beyond any of the Court's previous 

cases and beyond what is often given in cases 

like that, beyond what Congress requires in 

cases involving --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No. 

MR. GANNON: -- denials under (a)(2)

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Of course, it is,

requires more than a statutory cite but less 

than revealing your intelligence, a sentence 

would do, which is what they said.

It didn't just say, you know, 

terrorist activities, period.  When you 

identified a subsection, you were into something 

of a factual basis for that determination.  But 

that's not happening here.

MR. GANNON: -- Justice Breyer's

 dissent talked about --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- there were six

 discrete terrorist acts described.  Here, the 

statute says only any other unlawful activity.

 It is a generalist catch-all for "security and

 related grounds."  In your brief on page 3 to 4, 

you seem to agree that your ground has to be 

tied to security in some form, but we don't know 

security at all, meaning the way it's written, 

you could say no based on someone's jaywalking 

conviction --

MR. GANNON: We --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- or for stealing 

a piece of bread when they were five years old 

from a store.  I don't -- I mean, there are some 

-- countries that do criminalize even children 

acting. 

So how does a citation to unlawful 

activity tell anybody anything?  Here and in the 

D.C. Circuit case, you at least said we think 

he's a member of this organization, of this 

criminal organization.  That tells you 

something.

had previously committed a criminal offense.  It 

requires us to have a reasonable ground to

been considered an indicator for this since 

1965.

 So it's a -- there's a big difference between --

both are a single sentence, but one sentence

inaccuracy in what the government is doing, and

 the point of Mandel review.  The point of Mandel 

review is not to flyspeck the agency's reasons

the government had a reason and it was facially

jumped over several preliminary questions.

 Could -- before your time is up, could you say a

 little bit more about them?  For one thing, do

 you think that the Respondent has a cause of 

action and, if so, where does it come from?

 MR. GANNON: I don't know where it

 comes from, Justice Alito.  The complaint seems 

to assume that there's probably a constitutional

 cause of action.  That -- that's a pattern --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is it they --

they think it's an Ex parte Young cause of 

action? 

MR. GANNON: That's -- that's what is 

in -- I mean, that's -- I think that that's 

their reasoning.  The Ninth Circuit has 

obviously countenanced that, and so it hasn't 

been previously explored in this case. 

We don't think that -- they -- they 

also assert an APA claim. We think that we have 

good arguments that the APA does not provide a 

cause of action here, that this is excepted from 

judicial review in two different rationales that 

are explained in decisions that we cite in the 

reply brief in the D.C. Circuit, the Ninth 

Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit.

And so I don't know where the cause of 

action is, unless it is an implicit Ex parte

 Young-like action that they're asking for

 declaratory judgment on.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'll ask your

 friend about that.

 If there was a -- a protected liberty 

interest in Mandel, wouldn't it follow sort of a

 fortiori that there's a liberty -- a protected 

liberty interest here? If -- if the Respondent 

had not said, I -- I want to live with my 

husband in the United States, but had said, he 

has a lot of interesting things to say and so I 

wish he were here so I could listen to what he 

has to say and therefore exercise my First 

Amendment right to receive information, would 

that be sufficient? 

MR. GANNON: I don't think so.  I 

don't think that the marriage cases can be 

repleaded as First Amendment cases and -- and --

and satisfy Mandel.  Again, I would say that 

Mandel didn't even say that there is a 

constitutional right there. 

And, here, we think that the -- the 

point of -- of this is that -- we cite O'Bannon

for the premise that in the due process context, 

an enforcement action that is taken against one 

person doesn't create a liberty interest in a

 third party who is indirectly affected by that.

 So she is obviously affected by the 

decision that her husband can't come into the

 United States.  The same thing would be true if 

this were a removal proceeding, removing him 

from the United States, and you wouldn't say she 

has a due process interest in intervening in 

that case and making arguments that he can't 

make or arguments that he can make.  Either way, 

she doesn't have an independent due process 

interest there. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Gannon, you did 

ultimately provide a lot of information to -- to 

the Respondent, and the Ninth Circuit didn't 

fault that.  It found that you gave plenty of 

information in the end.  It just said it wasn't 

timely, and, therefore, it remanded to the 

district court to conduct further proceedings. 

I'm not clear what those are, what --

what that would look like, and I'm just curious 

what you understand -- you think would follow on 

remand and if there's a suggestion here perhaps

much information is enough, but, nevertheless, 

we want there to be a full-bore review.  The --

judicial confirmation that the government was

 And so, at the end of the day, we 

don't think that the district court would be

 able to order the issuance of a visa.  And the

 complaint doesn't ask for anything other than a 

declaration that the reason that had been given

 before we provided the -- the -- the additional

 details about MS-13 was -- was not legitimate 

and bona fide. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

Justice Thomas, anything further? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Gannon, what does 

-- exactly does the doctrine of consular 

nonreviewability do? 

MR. GANNON: We think that it prevents 

a noncitizen outside the United States from 

challenging a decision to deny a visa and also 

prevents a third party from attacking that 

decision.  To the extent that there's an 

exception that the Court wants to acknowledge, 

that would then get into whether there is a 

constitutional liberty interest, and that --

that's the first QP here.

interest in knowing why and an opportunity to 

oppose it if there is an opposition that can be 

had.

 In a conviction, the husband has 

gotten full notice, all the grounds have been 

told to the wife because there's been a public

 adjudication of that ground.

 Similarly, with all the other examples

 you provide, full process has been provided. 

But what you're saying is I have a right and,

Now you're saying you're entitled to

specifically said that we don't have to give a 

reason at all if this is the reason for the 

denial. 

But I would say that we don't think 

that there is a separate category of liberty 

interests for getting information as opposed to 

the underlying liberty interest. And so the 

fact that she wants to live with her husband in 

the United States doesn't mean that she has a 

liberty interest in having information related

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think I just want to 

understand the conversation that you had with 

Justice Alito before about the nature of the 

constitutional interest here versus in Mandel. 

So assume for purposes of this 

question that Mandel does require some kind of 

limited judicial review -- in other words, this 

legitimate and bona fide state explanation -- in 

the case where there is a constitutional right 

implicated, as there was in Mandel, and the 

question that I thought I heard Justice Alito 

asking was:  If you assume that, why would this 

constitutional right be less important than the 

constitutional right that was implicated in

that there could be a difference between First

 Amendment rights and -- and the Due Process 

Clause and the third-party interests that are at 

stake in the due process analysis under

 O'Bannon, but, as -- as I said to Justice Alito, 

I still don't think that that means that a 

spouse could come in and have a better claim 

because they want to talk in person with their 

spouse instead of, you know, over the telephone. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. Well, she 

wouldn't need a better claim if you were willing 

to say, yes, this -- the right -- the right of 

marriage and the burden that this places on that 

right is just as important as the right of 

listening to, you know, a lecturer ---

MR. GANNON: Yeah.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that was at issue 

in Mandel. 

MR. GANNON: And I think my basic 

answer to that, Justice Kagan, is -- this is the 

assumption of your question, which is that we 

think that Mandel didn't actually decide that, 

which is why it's open for the Court to decide

the first QP here.

 If it wants to assume that there's a

 liberty interest here that is equal to what the 

Court assumed was at stake in Mandel and sort of 

assumed was at issue in -- in -- in Trump 

against Hawaii and therefore gave a very limited

 form of review, then -- then -- then you'd be

 doing Mandel analysis and we think that we would

 win. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  One level, this is a 

very large case about fundamental liberty 

interests.  At another level, I wonder if it's a 

small case.  We talked about remedies a little 

bit a moment ago, you and I, and I'm -- I'm just 

curious, what remedy does the plaintiff seek 

here? 

I know they wanted originally a 

declaration that there wasn't a bona fide 

reason, seeming to take Mandel as given.  I'm 

looking at page 13 of their -- in their -- in 

their complaint.  But they got that.  They got 

that reason.  They got the Mandel reason.

 And I guess, you know, of course, the

 usual catch-all, grant such further relief, but 

if a district court can't order the husband into 

the country, what other relief remains that's

 available for a court to issue? 

MR. GANNON: We -- we don't think 

there is any.  I think that they've asked for 

declaratory judgment, that the reason that was 

given was not good enough.  I think that -- that

questions. 

MR. GANNON: Yeah, and -- and I agree 

with you that I -- I don't know what they -- I 

don't think there is anything that the court 

ought to be able to do on remand.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Kavanaugh?

 Justice Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, Mr. Gannon, I 

had understood the government -- this goes to

 the threshold question.  I had understood the

 government to essentially be asking us to take

 Justice Scalia's position in Din, but based on 

some of your colloquies with my colleagues 

today, I'm thinking that maybe what the 

government's first order position is -- and I 

had not gotten this from the brief, I thought 

you just mentioned it in a footnote -- is to say 

that Mandel should never have assumed that there 

was an exception if there was a fundamental 

right implicated. 

Is that right? 

MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that 

the -- the point of Justice Kennedy's -- I mean 

Justice Scalia's plurality opinion in Din would 

be that there wouldn't be an exception to 

consular nonreviewability that applied anyway, 

so I think it would get there one way or the 

other.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No, I agree, but

 it's different.  I mean, I think Justice Kagan

 called it a much more dramatic holding.  It

 would be different.  I -- I guess I see you 

potentially asking us to do one of two things.

 One would be to say there's no fundamental right

 here, she doesn't have a fundamental right in 

having her spouse live with her in the United 

States, and so the Mandel exception isn't 

triggered and she's not entitled to anything. 

MR. GANNON: That is our -- that is 

our front-line position, I agree. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MR. GANNON: And --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So you're not asking 

us to say and, by the way, people shouldn't have 

an opportunity to show that there's a 

fundamental right implicated because, after all, 

Mandel had just assumed that.  It didn't say 

that you are entitled to get a Mandel 

explanation if you can point to the existence of 

a fundamental right. 

Do you see what I'm saying? 

MR. GANNON:  That's right.  And I

-- if we assume that there is a constitutional

 liberty interest that is sufficient to trigger 

that review in Mandel, why isn't this one

 equally good?

 MR. GANNON: And our position is that

 this is not, as the --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah. 

MR. GANNON: -- plurality concluded in 

Kerry against Din, not a sufficient liberty 

interest to trigger any exception to consular 

nonreviewability that would look like Mandel

review one way or the other. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No, no, and I 

understand that, but I guess -- and I -- I'm 

still not quite sure what your position is. 

I understand that.  I'm just asking 

you, are you asking us to say -- to go still 

further than that and say and, by the way, 

Mandel just assumed that there would be an 

exception to consular nonreviewability if there 

was a fundamental right implicated, but we think 

there's no such exception at all, so not only is

 background of --

 MR. GANNON: -- consular

triggered here --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  That is what I --

MR. GANNON: -- for that reason. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  That is what 

I understood you to be asking from your brief,

course of the argument.  Okay. 

This goes to Justice Gorsuch's 

questions about what might happen, and this is 

something that I'll ask the other side as well, 

but what do you understand the further process 

to be? Because it doesn't do someone all that 

much good just to know what the reason was.

that information would be to have some 

opportunity to be heard about why it's wrong.

 But Mandel really is just about

 notice.  And none of the Court's cases, which 

are really just kind of Mandel and Din, have 

gotten into what would happen after that.

 What is your understanding?  Would 

they have to go back to the State Department? 

Go back to the consular official?  Is the idea 

that the district court would hear -- have some 

opportunity to hear why this is wrong and why 

the tattoos didn't really show an MS-13 

affiliation? 

MR. GANNON:  They -- they might 

contemplate that -- that -- that that's what 

they would be getting because they want the 

information that is what he said or what he did. 

We don't -- we don't think that that's 

appropriate.  I think that if -- if -- if the 

Court were to say that -- I -- so I'm not -- I'm

happen with respect to that.

information, they will know this was the reason

 for the first denial.

 But that doesn't mean that -- the

 point of Mandel isn't actually notice.  It's

 confirmation that the government had a reason.

 And so I -- I'm -- I'm still fighting the 

premise that the point of Mandel is to -- to 

provide the person who is complaining with some 

form of redress. It's instead just a 

confirmation that the government had a 

legitimate reason to do what it did here. 

There are procedures within the State 

Department that there were multiple levels of 

review of this decision.  Anytime that there is 

a denial, that has to be reviewed by a 

supervisor.  This particular basis for 

inadmissibility needs to be based on an advisory 

opinion from Washington, D.C. 

And so there are lots of other ways in 

which the State Department can be asked to go 

back and approve this decision.  We don't think 

that that should be done at the behest of -- of 

judicial review and a court saying you have to 

do this and I want to see all of your evidence.

 about fundamental rights and the way in which 

Mandel works. In your colloquy with Justice 

Barrett, I think you said that there is not a 

fundamental right to have her spouse live with 

her in the United States and that sort of that's 

the government's framing and the way in which 

you are approaching the first question.

 Is that -- am I wrong about that?

 MR. GANNON: I would -- I'd -- I'd 

phrase it slightly different, that there is no 

liberty interest in getting your spouse admitted 

into the United States, notwithstanding 

immigration law restrictions.  So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  But as 

MR. GANNON: -- yes, she has a liberty 

interest in living with -- living in the United 

States and in living with her spouse, but we 

don't think that that is a -- a liberty interest 

that allows her to overcome immigration 

determinations. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand 

that, but I'm just trying to see how your 

argument maps onto what the Court actually did 

in Mandel.  And as I read that case, as I look

at it, the first thing they're asking is whether 

these professors had some sort of right to

 receive information and ideas as protected under

 the First Amendment.

 They weren't saying at the level that

 you're saying now do they have a right to have

 this particular person -- or do they have a 

liberty interest in having this individual come 

to the United States as their first question. 

It looks as though the way this 

opinion is structured, Justice Blackmun starts 

off by saying, "In a variety of contexts, this 

Court has referred to a First Amendment right to 

receive information and ideas," and he goes on 

and talks about that.  And then he gets to the 

point that you're talking about when he says, 

"Recognition that First Amendment rights are 

implicated, however, is not dispositive of our 

inquiry." And then he goes on to do the rest of 

the inquiry. 

So I think the parallel structure here 

would be the recognition that there is, as we've 

said in so many cases, a fundamental right to 

marriage, to include cohabitation, to raising 

your family.  Those things exist.  And that's

we say there was no right to live in the nursing

 home of your choice?  Whereas we have recognized 

the fundamental right to marriage and raising a 

family and that kind of thing. So I think 

O'Bannon might be a little bit off in that way.

 MR. GANNON: Yeah, but, I -- I mean,

 the -- I don't think that that analysis carries 

the day here because the Court would -- would 

never apply that analysis for purposes of the 

removal proceeding or any of the other 

proceedings here.  The -- the -- the Court would 

not say that she has a due process right to 

participate in her husband's removal proceeding 

because it might take him out of the country. 

And so the -- the fact that there --

there is this long tradition of no judicial 

review of these types of decisions about what 

noncitizens will be admitted into the country, 

we think, creates a high bar here and that --

Over eight years ago, the government

 violated Sandra Muñoz's right to procedural due 

process by denying her husband's visa without

 providing a reason why.  Ms. Muñoz has a 

constitutional liberty interest in living with 

her husband. We do not claim that this interest

 gives her the right to immigrate her husband

 regardless of his inadmissibility, but the

 importance of cohabitation to marriage means 

that the government is required to provide 

procedural protections when it burdens the 

underlying right. 

The statute also informs what process 

is required.  There's nothing unusual about 

this. When government action burdens a 

substantive right, the Court often relies on 

procedural protections to balance the 

implications of that burden against the 

government's countervailing interest. 

The statute likewise here shows why 

Ms. Muñoz was herself deprived of that liberty 

interest and undermines the government's 

argument that she was a mere bystander.  Under 

the INA, the citizen petitioner must initiate 

and advance her spouse's application from start

to finish, and the very purpose of the consular 

process for spouses is to benefit the American

 citizen spouse.

 Given this interest, judicial review

 is required.  This Court has repeatedly 

acknowledged that the constitutional rights of 

U.S. citizens can be implicated by visa denials, 

and when they are, that review is necessary.

 Procedural due process, therefore, 

requires notice sufficient to allow a meaningful 

opportunity to respond.  A mere citation to a 

broad statute that encompasses any other 

unlawful activity forced Ms. Muñoz to guess at 

the reason for the denial and provided only a 

mere gesture at due process, which this Court 

said was insufficient in Mullane. 

The information Ms. Muñoz ultimately 

learned came after the one-year deadline to 

respond had passed and after the government had 

informed them that the -- its inadmissibility 

finding was permanent.  We now ask that 

Ms. Muñoz be given the chance to respond to that 

information now. 

And I welcome the Court's questions.

 can't think of any decision from this Court that 

said that such a liberty interest actually

 Would you give your best account of 

how you get to this liberty interest?

 interest in marital cohabitation which arises 

under the Constitution.  This is something which 

the Court has addressed on multiple occasions in 

the past.  In Loving against Virginia, for 

example, cohabitation was at the very heart of 

that case. 

That was a couple that was married in 

Washington, D.C., and the anti-miscegenation 

statute in the Commonwealth of Virginia 

prohibited them from living together as man and 

wife. The state court of appeals there said 

that the --

husband in the U.S., even if her husband is

 Smith against the Foster Families Organization,

intimate association was recognized by this

 Court as a substantive right.

 Even in the immigration context, Your

 Honor, at the peak of Chinese exclusion, in the

 United States against Gue Lim, the Court 

acknowledged even without any statutory hook 

that a noncitizen had the right to bring his 

wife to the country even though she did not 

herself possess a certificate which was required 

at the time.

husband for five years and that they had tried 

to go through the legal process and a denial was

 given without any -- any reason of the basis

has to be some level of review over.

 If the Court acknowledged in Mandel --

 Trump against Hawaii briefly where the Court 

said that "this Court has previously considered 

the merits of claims asserted by U.S. citizens 

regarding violations of their personal rights 

allegedly caused by the government's exclusion 

of particular foreign nationals." That's at 

2416 of the opinion.

 government to provide more evidence behind the

 reasoning, or what -- what happens?

 MR. LEE: Well, no, Your Honor.  What 

we think is the way that -- what we think is the 

most appropriate way to proceed would be to take 

what the Department of Homeland Security applies 

in the domestic context, which is a general 

level factual summary of the basis for the 

denial excluding material that is sensitive for 

national security purposes. 

What that would do is it would mean --

I don't think any party in this case wanted 

eight years of litigation.  This -- a rule like 

that would allow these cases to be determined at 

the agency level.

overcome the denial with the information that we 

now have.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  So Mr. Gannon 

suggested you -- you can go ahead and file a new 

application. 

MR. LEE: And the problem with that is 

that at page 16 of the Joint Appendix, the 

government informed my clients that its 

determination, its false determination of 

Mr. Asencio-Cordero's inadmissibility was 

permanent.  So I do not think that without an

only three years after the denial and two years 

into litigation.

inadmissibility became permanent, I believe it

reason is enough and you stop there and you

 don't go on.

 And -- and that was elaborated on in

 Trump versus Hawaii, that that's -- that's it. 

"Courts will neither look behind the exercise of 

that discretion nor test it by balancing its

 justification against the asserted

 constitutional interest."  That's kind of it --

MR. LEE: So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- for purposes of 

judicial. 

MR. LEE: Right.  And so I can -- I 

can get to some of the distinctions with Din and 

Justice Kennedy's concurrence, but I want to say 

first that the Court has applied that facially 

legitimate and bona fide test in two types of 

situations unlike the situation here. 

The first is the Trump v. Hawaii type 

situation or the Mandel type, where Congress has 

expressly granted to the executive branch a -- a 

discretionary ability to deny or grant some 

benefit or -- or in the case of Fiallo and Bell 

type situation, where that was a substantive 

direct challenge to a broad congressional policy 

choice.

Here, the government claims as though 

it's operating at the peaks of plenary power. 

But the amicus brief from the congressmen which

 was submitted says at page 23 that the

 department's position is that this decision 

should have been left to one political branch,

 the executive.

 The point I'm driving at, Your Honor,

 is that the Congress here has required that 

consular officers have a reason to believe an 

individual is inadmissible. 

The regulations refer to that as a 

standard which is akin to probable cause.  So we 

think, under a Mathews-Eldridge analysis, the 

risk of arbitrary deprivations and along with 

the --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, it seems to 

me --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- that's what 

you're trying to do, is replace Mandel and the 

Justice Kennedy concurrence and Trump versus 

Hawaii with a Mathews v. Eldridge test, which 

would then in turn as you would apply it require 

substantially more process than our precedents

 do that. 

MR. LEE: Well, don't get me wrong. 

We think we can prevail under the facially

 legitimate and bona fide test as well, and if I 

can turn to that and the second part of Your 

Honor's question. Din, there were a number of 

important distinctions from here before I get to 

the statutory ones which the Court touched on 

already. 

Number one, there was a factual basis 

in that case on the record, the -- the fact that 

Ms. Din's husband was working for the Afghan 

government when the Taliban was in power. 

There was reference earlier to 

1182(b)(3), which the government treats as a 

broad nondisclosure provision.  That is not the 

position that they took in Din against Kerry, 

where they said at page 50 and 51 of their 

merits brief that when the court does -- when 

the executive does disclose -- disclose 

additional material, that reflects a considered 

determination that the information provided does 

not require invoking the protections of 

1182(b)(3).

           They did not invoke 1182(b)(3) now, at 

the time of the denial, and so we think that 

that militates for at least enough --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but

 that's -- that's an implicit weighing of the

 competing interests, right?  I mean, you have to

 have that at some point given your claim.  And I

 just want to know how you do that.  How do you

 weigh the interest in cohabitation and marriage 

against the security values under consular 

nonreviewability? 

MR. LEE: Sure. And I think the 

answer is more simple than the government lets 

on because the regulations which the Department 

of Homeland Security applies in the domestic 

context to the same exact statutory framework, 

the same grounds of inadmissibility, 8 C.F.R. 

103.2 says that an applicant shall be advised of 

the facts --

a pretty dramatic premise if you're going to 

say, well, it's the same as it's going to be in

 the domestic context.  The whole point of

 consular nonreviewability is that it's not in

 the domestic context.

 MR. LEE: Well, but, by the same 

token, Your Honor, it wouldn't make sense if

 this -- if these due process regulations apply 

in the domestic context to noncitizens, but they 

don't apply when a U.S. citizen's rights are 

implicated at the consular level. 

The amicus brief submitted by former 

DHS officials suggests that this is a 

reasonable, workable proposal, and they cite 

this provision which I'd just like to quote 

briefly, which says that the applicant "shall be 

advised of the facts and offered an opportunity 

to rebut the information and present information 

in his or her own behalf before the decision is

 contrary to what -- you know, the quote from 

Justice Frankfurter, which I don't remember. He 

said that's something that's been in the body 

politic from the very beginning, that the United 

States has control over its borders with respect 

to noncitizens who seek to come in.

 MR. LEE: But not, Your Honor, when

 the rights of a U.S. citizen are implicated.

 And the position that the government has put 

Ms. Muñoz in is that she's been permanently 

separated from the man that she loves for eight 

years without having any basis, any chance when 

there was an opportunity to respond under the 

regulations, to try and convince them that they 

made a mistake. 

Let me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to put --

pause just very briefly.  She's not been 

permanently separated from the man that she 

loves. That person is not allowed to be 

admitted into the United States.

Honor ---

because the government cannot dilute an American

 citizen's citizenship by forcing them to -- by 

giving them the chance to exercise their liberty

 interests only by forfeiting the protection of

 the Constitution.

 El Salvador is under martial law.  The 

State Department warns American citizens not to 

travel there. And Ms. Muñoz was born and raised 

in this country.  She has a successful law 

practice here. Her father served in the U.S. 

Army in World War II in Germany.

 reason.

 But you didn't get it in time as I 

understand the issue. You didn't get it in time

 to invoke the reconsideration processes that the

 State Department usually has for exactly this

 purpose.  Is that correct?

 MR. LEE: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, if I think that 

the simple statement, he was an MS-13 member, is 

sufficient under Mandel, but you didn't get it 

in time to invoke the reconsideration process to 

say, no, you got that wrong, he wasn't an MS-13 

member, what do we do now? 

MR. LEE: Then I think the Court would 

have to remand so that the individual could have 

an opportunity to try and prove to the consulate 

that they may have made a mistake.  And there's 

a big, big difference between any other unlawful 

activity --

what we should do now, given that the 

information that satisfies Mandel was untimely,

 determination, that's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So the only relief 

you seek is the opportunity to file a motion for

 reconsideration at the consulate?  Is that it?

 MR. LEE: Yes, with the caveat that

 the government's inadmissibility determination

Judge Lee's observation that, as a practical

the motion for reconsideration deadline passed

understood that the gang membership in MS-13 was 

the hang-up.

the second part of Your Honor's question first.

 We actually -- Ms. Muñoz and Mr. Asencio-Cordero

 did not guess correctly.  The government -- at 

page 107 and 108 of the Joint Appendix below, 

the government said that the tattoos were merely

 the suspicion which triggered the inquiry.

 So there was no correct guess of the

 factual basis for the denial at all.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, but I -- I think 

that's slicing the baloney a little thinly, 

counsel, because, yes, you thought the tattoos 

were the basis.  But you thought the tattoos 

were the basis because they suggested gang 

membership, which is exactly what the government 

thought too. 

MR. LEE: But, even there, there is a 

very significant difference between gang 

membership, there are hundreds of these gangs, 

and the specific gang that they ultimately 

provided three years later. 

Now I'll be very concrete with how we 

would have done this differently if we'd have 

even known that bit of information in a brief 

aside to say that I think if there was

 government to say he's affiliated with an

 there was additional facts that did not 

implicate national security, like the facts 

which were ultimately provided here, that it was 

based on a criminal review --

Mandel, why doesn't it follow that -- that any

that would only be enough if the other -- if

 That affidavit only mentions MS-13, I

 makes -- it uses MS-13 as an example.  It makes 

no attempt to actually analyze how these tattoos

 If we think you don't get that much 

more under Mandel, I guess I don't see why

 Justice Gorsuch isn't right that this is just

 game over. 

MR. LEE: Well, let me answer that by 

coming back to the -- Justice Kennedy's 

concurrence in Din, because that concurrence --

and I'm operating under the assumption that 

we're working with Mandel here -- that 

concurrence -- specified at page 105 that the --

that the terrorism bar contained discrete 

factual predicates.  There were six or seven 

types of activity that there --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But you know a gang 

here. Like, Justice Gorsuch, the premise of his 

question was not just that you knew the general 

statute.  I understand you think that's not 

enough.  But he said, if you knew further that 

it was because of international gang membership, 

membership in an international gang that 

conducts violence and would likely conduct 

violence in the United States, why isn't that 

enough?  That's different than just a statutory 

citation.

denying visas to people who would present a 

danger when they get to the United States?

 the United States.

 MR. LEE: And -- and I think the Court

 has addressed a similar context in the

 prison-type cases, Vitek against Jones, Harper

 against Washington, where the Court recognized

 an underlying substantive constitutional

 interest, for example, in not being forced to 

take psychotropic drugs or not being removed to 

a mental facility, and yet it -- the way it 

balanced those interests was by providing a 

minimal level of procedural due process. 

And I think one of the points that is 

important to consider thematically here, Your 

Honor, is consular officers work very hard. 

They have very heavy caseloads.  They're working 

under very difficult conditions. And what we're 

asking for is for them to give us enough 

information to help them make a decision that's 

going to -- foster the government's --

           JUSTICE ALITO: If I could follow up. 

What if an American citizen wants to have a

 child who is a noncitizen admitted to the United

 States?  Would the same thing apply there?  Or 

an American citizen wants to have a noncitizen

 parent admitted or an American citizen who 

doesn't believe in marriage wants to have a 

noncitizen admitted to the United States so that 

person can live in an intimate relationship with 

that person in the United States? 

What about all those situations? 

MR. LEE: So the only person that's 

going to have both the -- and I want to take a 

half step back in answering that and try and 

define the interest precisely as well.  The only 

person who's going to have an interest directly 

deprived is going to be a spouse. 

You have to have both an underlying 

liberty interest, which we get from the 

Constitution, and you have to have a direct 

deprivation, which we get from the statute.  It 

totally distinguishes the facts here from 

O'Bannon, where the -- the home care patients 

had no statutory role to play whatsoever in the 

certification process, et cetera.

But -- so the point I'm trying to make

 is that -- and the Court understands that 

immigration law is quite complicated, I don't 

want to go on too long on this, but you have --

citizens can only petition immediate relatives 

and citizens have to be adults to petition

 immediate relatives.

 So the Court -- so all those other 

floodgates concerns are exaggerated because the 

only person who's going to both be statutorily 

involved enough to have been directly deprived 

and have an underlying liberty interest in 

marital cohabitation --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is there a 

liberty -- do those people have a liberty 

interest?  And if they do, then how can it be 

deprived by statute?  How can it be taken away 

by a statute? 

MR. LEE: So, for example, a 

grandparent and a grandchild, they certainly 

would have an underlying liberty interest. 

That's from the Moore case.  But they wouldn't 

be able to petition each other.  So my point is

 Honor posits because you need to both -- and

 there is no -- the Court has not recognized a

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not a flood --

 cohabitation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- it's not a flood --

it's not a floodgates argument.  It's a 

constitutional argument.  It's how we determine 

which interests are sufficient to allow the 

citizen, the American citizen, to contest the 

denial of a visa for a -- a close relative or 

a -- a person with whom the person has a close 

relationship who's not an American citizen. 

MR. LEE: Well, this is a case about 

marriage, Your Honor, and this is a case about 

the importance of marriage.  And this Court has 

recognized this.  Congress for over 200 years 

has recognized this even in the immigration 

context.

the peak of Chinese exclusion, Congress passed

 the Scott Act, which exempted Chinese laborers 

who had wives in the United States.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Lee, I -- I -- I 

guess what I'm not seeing, to me, there's no

 weighing at issue here.  The way I understand

 the analysis worked -- as working is that if you 

come forward with a constitutional right, 

whether it's the right to listen to ideas from 

somebody overseas or -- or certainly whether 

it's the right to associate with your spouse who 

is overseas, if you come forward with a 

constitutional right of that kind in cohabiting 

or associating with a person who is not getting 

a visa, that gets you something, but it doesn't 

get you weighing. 

It gets you this very limited judicial 

review which says the government now has to say 

why it's excluding that person.  So that's all 

it gets you.  It's just like you come forward 

with a right.  We don't weigh that right.  It 

just gives you the ability to force the 

government to say one or two sentences about why 

they're excluding that person. 

So what weighing are we talking about?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But Mandel -- and --

and this is just a question about the

 constitutional argument.  This is -- kind of 

goes back to the questions I was asking before.

 Mandel talks about notice and giving 

you the basis, but it doesn't talk about Mullane

 and an opportunity to be heard.  And your 

weighing, I take it, is probably coming from 

Mathews versus Eldridge, which I don't think is 

the standard here. 

So where do we get the constitutional 

right to an opportunity to be heard in this 

Mandel context? 

MR. LEE: Well, keep in mind that in 

Mandel there was a broad discretionary grant. 

We think that that's a foundational difference 

between Mandel and this case. 

And so, because this is a -- this is a 

nondiscretionary decision which Congress has 

established, officers must have this reason to 

believe, we think that that does a lot to get us 

to where we need to be, Your Honor.

 MR. LEE: We do not need any

 additional judicial review here, Your Honor.  I

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you do

 that by doing what?

 MR. LEE: Well, we do that by

 requiring that there is -- I mean, we've had

 some discussion as to whether the facially 

legitimate and bona fide test applies or whether 

something slightly more strenuous applies. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't care 

what the test is.  What is it that the tests 

entail? 

MR. LEE: The test is entailed at 

determining that the government did not make a 

decision which either has no basis in reality or 

which was violative of the rights of a U.S. 

citizen.  And so, here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it 

involve weighing the interest -- the marriage 

interest and the international interest?

another government interest, which is in uniting 

American citizens with their spouses.

others, if there's a liberty interest, then the 

Mandel standard applies.  The Mandel standard 

was applied in Justice Kennedy's opinion in --

in Kerry versus Din and also in Trump versus 

Hawaii.  That requires a facially legitimate 

basis and a bona fide factual basis, right? 

Facially legitimate and bona fide? 

MR. LEE: That's the test, yes.

that in Kerry versus Din.

 The government's citation of 

1182(a)(3)(B) also indicates it relied on a bona

 fide factual basis.  And it's also facially

 legitimate.  That's on page 105. Then he says: 

"Mandel instructs us not to look behind the 

government's exclusion for additional factual 

details beyond what" it -- "its express reliance

 on 1182(a)(3)(B) encompassed." 

It goes on. "The government 

furthermore was not required, as Din claims, to 

point to a more specific provision within 

1182(a)(3)(B), even though the statutory 

provision the consular officer cited covers a 

broad range of conduct," and then says, notes 

"the government's not prohibited from offering 

more, but the statute expressly refrains from 

requiring it to do so."  Says "Congress 

evaluated the benefits and burdens" here and 

"assigned discretion to the Executive." 

And then concludes, I think, with the 

closer here that's problematic for you: "Under 

Mandel, respect for the political branches' 

broad power over the creation and administration 

of the immigration system extends to

 determinations of how much information the

 Government is obliged to disclose about a 

consular officer's denial of a visa to an alien

 abroad."

 So you put all that together, I -- I 

think that's very problematic for you if we

 follow that.  And that, in turn, was explicating

 what -- what Mandel meant and what Trump versus

 Hawaii then relied on this -- this opinion.  So 

that's a problem for you, I think, so tell me 

why it's not. 

MR. LEE: Yeah, we don't think it's a 

problem for us, Your Honor, because of the 

distinctions here and with Din.  So, number one, 

that was a case where there was -- the 

government had decided to invoke 1182(b)(3). 

Justice Kennedy does refer to the reasons for 

the denial in that case.  There was the Taliban 

fact. The government had there invoked (b)(3). 

The plaintiffs in that case were required to 

make an as-applied substantive challenge to that 

statute.  We don't have to do so here. 

But the main distinction, if I

to make a couple of points about the terrorism 

bar because not only does this draw a line 

around a distinct finite range of activity that 

the officer must have found to have existed to

 have a reasonable -- reason to believe, pardon 

me, also, there's language in there defining a

 terrorist organization, language defining

 terrorist activity, an intent requirement.

 And so we think that that's -- that's 

a lot more --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's your big 

distinction, but the problem for you is they 

wanted a more specific identification there. 

And he said in that opinion, "the Government was 

not required to point to a more specific 

provision," even though "the statutory provision 

the consular officer cited covers a broad range 

of conduct," which seems -- I mean, it's slicing 

it very thin then to say that's a distinction 

between that case and this case. I'll leave --

well, give a brief response. 

MR. LEE: The critical phrase -- sure. 

The critical phrase in Justice Kennedy's 

analysis of the statute is that it contained 

discrete factual predicates.  "Any other

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  You're the

 Respondent.  The government has petitioned.  And

 if we did nothing, you'd be fine, right, because 

you didn't want us to take this case?

 MR. LEE: Correct.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So let

to roll back or change the doctrine of consular 

nonreviewability in order for you to win in this

MR. LEE: No. I think that the 

Court's position in Trump against Hawaii gets us 

where we need to be on that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why is that?  Say a 

little bit more. 

MR. LEE: Because the doctrine -- the 

doctrine of consular nonreviewability does not 

apply to American citizens.  The government --

the executive branch cannot restrict review 

without a statutory provision granting it the 

ability to strip review. This is not a case 

where Congress has gone anywhere near that.  The

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you -- we have

 never applied the doctrine of consular 

nonreviewability in the context of an American

 citizen you're saying?

 MR. LEE: The Court has always 

reviewed the merits of claims brought by

 American citizens, constitutional claims, that's

 correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And any such review 

in this situation -- so let's say we disagree 

with you on that.  Let's say we disagree.  The 

-- the doctrine of consular nonreviewability 

applies, but it appears from Mandel that we have 

recognized an exception to it. Is that how you 

understand at least the government's secondary 

argument in this case? 

MR. LEE: It's a pretty important 

exception from the standpoint of separation of 

powers, but, yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So we're 

into Mandel even if there is the doctrine of 

nonreviewability.  And so why would you say that 

you win given the Mandel standard? I mean, they 

didn't win in that case.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes.

 MR. LEE: Because, here, unlike in

 Mandel -- in that case, the professor had 

violated a prior visa. The Court held that

 there was a factual basis for the Attorney

 General's denial of a fully discretionary

 waiver.  Here, you have a non-discretionary 

statute requiring reason to believe there's no 

factual basis for the denial, and, therefore, 

the government hasn't established that the 

denial was facially legitimate and bona fide.

Would you be okay with an analysis that assumed 

the first question presented? 

MR. LEE: If we were to prevail on the

this type of relief. But, if this is a

 constitutional liberty interest underlying this, 

I'm not sure why people wouldn't be able to say

 the inability to make those petitions is

 unconstitutional, and so -- and no court has 

countenanced that type of argument in any other

 context.

 Second, my friend talks about the 

domestic context, talks about what DHS does when 

there are proceedings in the United States, 

which obviously implicate different interests 

because somebody is here and they -- there is a 

mechanism for some judicial review there. 

But it's important to recall here that 

State is the first line of defense on these 

issues, and if they deny a visa on the basis of 

somebody being inadmissible and that person 

doesn't come here, then there isn't going to be 

any judicial inquiry.  If they deny a visa and 

that person does come here and DHS wants to 

remove that person, then the fact that they came 

here without a visa is an independent ground of 

inadmissibility, and so they'd be much more 

likely to be charged with that than the -- than 

the expectation that they would be engaged in

 United States.

 And, third, if I could get to the

 colloquy with Justice Gorsuch and my friend 

talked about the determination that this ground

 of inadmissibility was permanent and cited page

 16 of the Joint Appendix.

 The letter that is included there is 

one that simply said that this determination of 

inadmissibility is not waivable. So there's not 

a procedure for getting us to consider whether 

we're going to make an exception the way DHS had 

done here on the ground of inadmissibility 

associated with his previous unlawful presence 

in the United States. 

That doesn't say that this is a 

permanent basis of inadmissibility.  He can 

reapply for a visa and present whatever evidence 

he wants to persuade us that we were wrong the 

first time around, but that's not the same thing 

as saying that there is a judicially overseen 

procedure for rehearing that would allow the --

the courts to consider whether our reasons are

 inadmissibility finding to be declared

 incorrect.  And so we would disagree that that's 

-- that's what any court should be doing on

 remand here.  The point of Mandel is not to

 allow for meaningful opportunities to respond or 

further internal appeals or further judicial

 review.

 The Court in Mandel was clear.

 Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Din was clear 

that there's no testing or looking behind the 

court's decision.  And my friend said that in 

Mandel the government showed that there was the 

fact that he had previously violated the terms 

of previous entries.  That was a hotly contested 

issue in the case.  The dissent said that that 

was a sham and there was no evidence in the 

record to support it. 

The majority said we're not testing or 

looking behind the government's assertion.  This 

is not about allowing courts to police whether 

the government's reasoning is correct.  The 

consular officer has to have a reason to believe 

that this person is inadmissible in order to 

deny the visa, but that is not judicially 

reviewable.
