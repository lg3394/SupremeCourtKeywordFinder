 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-411,

 Murthy versus Missouri. 

Mr. Fletcher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The government may not use coercive 

threats to suppress speech, but it is entitled 

to speak for itself by informing, persuading, or 

criticizing private speakers. 

Like Bantam Books, this case should be 

about that fundamental distinction between 

persuasion and coercion.  But, unlike Bantam and 

the case that you'll hear next, this is not a 

typical suit where a speaker challenges 

government actions affecting its own speech. 

Instead, two states and five individuals are 

trying to use the Article III courts to audit 

all of the executive branch's communications 

with and about social media platforms. 

That problem has infected every step

of this case.  Respondents don't have standing 

at all because they have not shown an imminent 

threat that the government will cause a platform 

to moderate their posts in particular. But the 

lower courts still reviewed a vast range of

 speech by different officials to different

 platforms about different topics at different 

times without asking whether it had anything to

 do with Respondents. 

And the courts then entered a 

universal injunction restricting speech about 

any content posted on any platform by anyone and 

binding thousands of officials, including 

presidential advisors speaking to the public and 

FBI agents trying to protect the nation from 

foreign threats. 

Even apart from the Article III 

problem, that injunction rests on two 

fundamental legal errors.  First, the Fifth 

Circuit radically expanded the state action 

doctrine by holding that even concededly 

non-coercive communications, like the CDC's 

public health advice, can transform private 

platforms' editorial choices into state action. 

And, second, the Fifth Circuit mistook

 persuasion for coercion.  It held that the FBI's

 communications are inherently coercive because 

the FBI is a law enforcement agency, a theory

 that even Respondents don't defend in this 

Court, and it held that White House officials 

engaged in coercion because they used strong 

language or referred in a general way to legal 

reforms in response to press questions.

 If this Court reaches the merits, it 

should reaffirm that government speech crosses 

the line into coercion only if, viewed 

objectively, it conveys a threat of adverse 

government action.  And because no threats 

happened here, the Court should reverse. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Fletcher, is the 

coercion/encouragement framework out of Brant --

of Bantam Book the only way to look at this 

case? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think there are 

two ways to look at this case. I think one of 

them is the coercion inquiry, which we think 

comes from Bantam Books.  You can think of that 

as an aspect of state action because, when 

private parties are compelled to act, as the

Court said in Halleck, they become state actors.

 We think that's the right way to think about

 this case.

           Respondents and the lower courts have

 also proposed a different way, the state action

 way. They've suggested that, even absent

 coercion, the government's speech, if it

 encourages in some colloquial sense private 

action, it can turn that private action --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do we -- do -- do we 

MR. FLETCHER: -- into state action. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Just to -- so I 

understand your argument, do we normally apply 

state action doctrine in cases involving the 

government or private parties? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Both, I think. You 

know, in some state action cases, you're asking 

-- someone is suing a private party and alleging 

that that private party is bound by the contours 

of the First Amendment or other constitutional 

provisions because they're state actors.  You 

see some suits like that that look like this, 

suits against the platforms, suits against

what that gets at is that it's very unusual, and 

we don't think it's possible for the government, 

through speech alone, to transform private 

speakers into state actors.  We think these

side of the line and all we're talking about is 

government speech, then there's no state action 

and there's also no First Amendment --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So --

MR. FLETCHER:  -- problem.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- one final

 question.  You continue to refer back to --

refer to government speech.  Just for my 

edification, what's the constitutional basis for 

-- for government speech? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So the Court has 

said, I think, that the government is entitled 

to speak for itself.  It's not a right that 

comes from the First Amendment.  It's a feature 

of our constitutional democracy. As the Court 

has said, the government couldn't function if it 

couldn't express points of view. In Walker, the 

Court explained, for example, that the 

government has to be able to run a vaccination 

campaign at times of public health crisis.  I 

think that's a major part of what was going on 

here. So the Court hasn't located it in any 

specific constitutional provision.  It's just 

part of democratic governance.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you explain to 

me what exactly is the injunction doing? 

Meaning how is it affecting your speech, the 

government's speech? And there's a lot of

 defendants.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's a lot of 

agencies. I know that our case law says an

 injunction just can't tell you to violate the 

law, and so this injunction might have that 

problem inherent in it.  But the Fifth Circuit 

injunction is what's before us, correct? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it says to 

encourage or significantly -- to coerce --

that's a legal term. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or significantly 

encourage.  And you're questioning whether --

what the meaning of "significant encouragement" 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

think the problem with that -- we don't say that

That is prohibited by the First Amendment.  But 

the problem with the Fifth Circuit's injunction 

saying don't coerce or significantly encourage 

is that it comes at the end of 80 pages of legal 

analysis holding that the government had done 

those things by -- for example, when the FBI 

would send communications to the platforms

malign foreign actors like Russian intelligence

 operatives to spread disinformation on your

 platforms, do with it what you will.

 That, the -- the -- the Fifth Circuit

 held, is coercive because the FBI is a powerful

 law enforcement agency.  And I think, if the 

injunction were put in place, the FBI would have 

to think very hard about whether it could 

continue to do that. 

Similarly, I think both the Fifth 

Circuit and my friends have really said that the 

crux of what they claim was coercion here was 

what happened in July of 2021 when the Surgeon 

General, the White House Press Secretary, and 

the President himself made statements 

criticizing the platforms' practices on 

misinformation and false statements about COVID 

vaccines and calling on them to do better. 

I think it's really troubling, the 

idea that those sorts of classic bully pulpit 

exhortations, public statements urging actors to 

behave in different ways, might be deemed to 

violate the First Amendment.  And I think, if

 President isn't enjoined, but if his senior

 advisors, the press secretary or someone else,

children's mental health or national security 

issues, like the anti-Semitic Osama Bin Laden 

letter that was trending on TikTok at the end of 

last year that we reference towards the end of 

our brief, I think all of those things could be 

done only under the shadow of the injunction. 

And that comes around to the other 

point that you made, which is that this 

injunction, especially read in light of the 

opinion comes before -- that becomes before it, 

is extremely vague.  And I think having that 

sort of vague injunction with these contestable

broadly as applied to past conduct hanging over

doing all of these things is a real problem and

entering such an injunction at the behest of two 

states and five individual social media users

 whose main complaints are about the moderation 

of posts about COVID-19 many years ago that they 

haven't really even shown were traceable to the

 government to begin with, we think.

 And we certainly don't think that they

 have shown that they face the sort of imminent 

threat of future injury that's required to 

satisfy Article III. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Fletcher, let me 

follow up on that. If even one of the 

plaintiffs has standing, then we're required to 

get to the merits. So let me ask you about 

Ms. Hines, and as you just mentioned, she must 

have faced an imminent threat of future injury 

at the time when the complaint was filed, and 

that injury must be traceable to the actions of 

the government. 

So, in the first part of that, 

imminent threat of future injury, her Facebook 

personal account was restricted at the time when 

the complaint was filed.  So why isn't that 

sufficient to show a threat of -- an imminent 

threat of future injury?

 that when the private platforms moderated the 

plaintiffs' pages or their posts, that's an

 injury in some sense.  We haven't disputed that

 they suffered that injury.  We've disputed the

 traceability question --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Fine.

 MR. FLETCHER:  -- and then the

 redressability question. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay. Right. So, on 

traceability, traceability is basically a 

question of causation, right? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Agreed. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Both --

the -- the district court found that the injury 

was traceable to the government's actions, and 

the -- the Fifth Circuit accepted that finding, 

reviewed it and accepted it. 

So that's two lower courts.  We don't 

usually reverse findings of fact that have been 

endorsed by two lower courts.  And you haven't 

attempted to show that it was clear -- that that 

finding is clearly erroneous.

Justice Alito, I disagree with that.  I think

that the Fifth Circuit and the district court 

applied too loose a notion of traceability. 

They didn't try to say this post or any post or 

any action against Ms. Hines was traceable to

 any action by the government.

 They did what the red brief calls a

 bird's eye view of traceability. They said the

 government is talking to the platforms a lot. 

The platforms are doing moderation, and so we'll 

just assume that all of that moderation is 

traceable to the government. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, do you think 

that it's necessary to identify a single 

government action and then trace it to a single 

consequence?  Do you think that's required? 

MR. FLETCHER:  No, but I think you 

have to trace some government action to some 

consequence that befell you.  And maybe I could 

just be specific about this because we challenge 

this in our opening brief, and the red brief 

comes back at pages 19 to 21 and offers up what 

I take to be their best examples of traceable 

harm, and I invite you to go look at the pages 

of the record that they're citing because often 

what you find is that they're citing moderation

 than the government's action was a motivating

 factor? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I don't know the 

answer to that in all cases, and I'm -- I'm 

reluctant to make sort of broad statements about 

what the traceability requirement demands in 

different circumstances. 

I will say here we're not disputing 

that. We're saying that they haven't shown any 

causal connection between the --

approach where they said the government is 

talking to the platforms about moderation and

 the platforms are moderating content.

 But the platforms were moderating this 

content long before the government was talking 

to them. They had powerful business incentives

 to do the same thing.  The acts of moderation 

were consistent with the platforms' own 

policies, and this is, I think, another telling 

fact. In those red brief examples that we 

talked about on pages 19 to 21, some of them 

involved platforms like LinkedIn that wasn't 

even the subject of the challenged White House 

and Solicitor General -- or, excuse me, Surgeon 

General's office communications with the 

platforms.

that there are any factual findings with respect 

to standing that we are required to give clear 

error review to? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I think findings of 

historical fact, absolutely.  We're not fighting

moderated, that the government made certain 

statements.  And if there had been findings that

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. I mean, that's

 what I was really getting at.  Are there

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah we -- we do. 

And I -- I can't give you a list because there's 

a lot of facts in this case, but I -- we agree 

historical factual findings count.  What we say 

don't count are findings that are really 

characterizations, which is a lot of what my 

friends are relying on, findings that are about 

the application of law to facts, which in this 

constitutional realm we think get de novo 

review, and then findings that are premised on 

erroneous legal standards. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So -- so, Mr. 

Fletcher, I -- I -- I just want to nail down 

what your views are on -- on the legal 

standards.  On traceability, you're not 

disputing that a motivating factor is enough.

 redressability, what's your view of the legal

 MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I think, again, it 

has to be some showing that I think likely to 

redress the injury is the standard from Lujan,

 it -- so it doesn't have to be certain, but you 

have to make some showing that an injunction 

against the government will stop the platforms 

from doing what they want. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In -- in 

Massachusetts versus EPA, we said likely "to 

some extent."  Does that strike you as correct? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I -- I think, in 

the context of Mass. versus EPA, maybe where 

you're talking about a problem of degrees.  You 

know, here, where the concern is are the 

platforms going to moderate my posts or not and

government or not and will an injunction against

 understand that at this time, this was a time

 when thousands of Americans were still dying 

every week and there was a hope that getting 

everyone vaccinated could stop the pandemic. 

And there was a concern that Americans 

were getting their news about the vaccine from 

these platforms, and the platforms were 

promoting, not just posting --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I --

MR. FLETCHER:  -- but promoting, bad 

information. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- I understand all 

that and I know the objectives were good, but --

but, once again, they were also getting their 

news from the print media and the broadcast 

media and cable media, and I just can't imagine 

the federal government doing that to them. But 

maybe I'm naive.  Maybe that goes on behind the

me as wow, this is not what I understand the

 relationship to be.  That's all. I -- I --

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, but I -- I do.  I

 think this is important because I have the same

 reaction that you do, that these emails look 

unusual. I think the idea that there would be 

back and forth between the government and the

 media isn't unusual at all. 

When the White House Press Secretary 

on July 16th is asked about this by the press at 

the time, what she says is, of course, we talk 

to the platforms just the way we talk to all of 

you when we have concerns about what you're 

doing, when we have information that you might 

find helpful. 

Now there's an intensity of the back 

and forth here and there's an anger that I think 

is unusual, but the context for that I think is 

that these platforms were saying publicly, we 

want to help, we think we have a responsibility 

to give people accurate information and not bad 

information, and we're doing everything we can 

to meet that goal. 

That's where this language of

 partnership comes from.  It's not just from the

 White House.  It's these platforms, which are

 powerful sophisticated entities, saying we're

 doing the best we can.

 And the anger, I think really most of 

the anger when you read the emails -- and I 

appreciate that you have because I think you

 have to look at them in context -- the anger is 

when the officials think that the platforms are 

not being transparent about the scope of the 

problem or aren't giving information that's 

available. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me ask you one --

one more question and -- and then I'll stop at 

least for now. You make a big point in both 

your brief and your reply that states don't have 

First Amendment rights. 

But are you saying that they may have 

a free speech right, but it comes from someplace 

else, or they don't have free speech rights?  Do 

you think that the federal government could 

prohibit a governor or the top-ranking public 

health official in a state from speaking to the 

residents? 

MR. FLETCHER:  No, I don't think it

 that they have speech rights.  We're saying that

 those things like the federal government's 

speech rights come from the structure of our

 Constitution, not from the First Amendment.

 This is a First Amendment case.  And I 

think, really, what's happening here is that

 these states, which were the motivating factor 

behind the suit, the only plaintiffs in the 

initial complaint, are really trying to 

represent and to litigate the First Amendment 

rights of their citizens on their citizens' 

behalf.  We think that's an end run around the 

limit on parens patriae standing, just like the 

one the Court rejected in Brackeen.

MR. FLETCHER:  So, Justice Alito, that 

-- this is why I want to be careful here. I'm

 acknowledging the reality that this happens and

 that it's -- it may be commonplace.  I'm not 

saying it's a good thing or a great thing or a

 thing to be celebrated.

 But, fundamentally, I'm saying the

 First Amendment isn't a civility code.  It is an

 important protection, it's a critical protection 

against actual coercion, but I think it's 

important to police that line, and I think this 

case, the sort of sprawling audit of all of 

these communications, shows the danger of 

allowing parties, especially parties without 

real direct injuries, to come into court and to 

challenge these sorts of regular 

back-and-forths. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the -- on the 

partners point, though, that does strike me as 

unusual.  I mean, how -- what do you think about 

that? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So that, I think, is 

traceable to the unusual feature here of this is 

not the government where the platforms were 

saying we don't want to deal with you about

 this, and the government is calling them up and 

saying, no, we're partners, let's be partners. 

You could imagine a situation like that where

 there might be a problem.  You might start to

 think that that starts to shade into coercion.

 But, here, it's an open door. The

 platforms are saying publicly, because they're 

getting public criticism about this from other 

people too, from the press, from the World 

Health Organization, from others, they're saying 

publicly we want to do our part. We recognize 

we have a responsibility, that we're a source of 

information for people, and we want to be a 

source of good information. 

And so, when the White House calls and 

says we have some concerns about this, they say 

we agree.  You know, that's a good point you 

make over here.  We disagree with you over here. 

We're not going to go this far, but we agree 

with you.

government's first point with respect to the

 merits of this. 

But I'm -- I'm interested in your view 

that the context doesn't "change the First

 Amendment principles."  I mean, I understood our

 First Amendment jurisprudence to require

 heightened scrutiny of government restrictions

 of speech but not necessarily a total 

prohibition when you're talking about a 

compelling interest of the government to ensure, 

for example, that the public has accurate 

information in the context of -- of a 

once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. 

So I'm -- I'm just interested in the 

government sort of conceding that if there was 

coercion, then we automatically have a First 

Amendment violation. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I'm not conceding 

that that would be the case.  I could imagine 

that in times of pandemic, if there were actual 

restrictions, maybe those would be justified. 

But our position here, because we think it's the 

position consistent with the facts, is that 

there wasn't any coercion to begin with.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- on -- on that 

point, you mentioned coercion -- you mentioned

 there also be coercion in your view in terms of

 inducements?

the flip side, one or the other. I think, in 

the next case, you could construe it either way, 

threat of prosecution, offer of leniency. 

So we acknowledge that it could be 

both, but it has to be a threat or an inducement 

of some concrete government action, not just 

more government speech. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And, 

hypothetically -- and I'm not saying this 

happened here -- but would a threat or an 

inducement with respect to antitrust actions 

qualify as coercion? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Sure. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And a -- a threat or 

an inducement with respect to Section 230 

qualify?

harder for two reasons.  One is that these are 

executive branch officials who don't have the

 ability to unilaterally enact 230 reform.  I

 think the question is --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But they -- they

 have a power to influence that.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Influence that, but the

 question is would --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And is that -- would 

that be enough to say we're going to -- if you 

don't do X, we are going to change our position 

on Section 230? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So potentially yes as 

to legislation.  230, if I could just get this 

out, though --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- I think is different 

because 230 is about content moderation.  It's 

-- it's -- it's about this very issue.  And I 

think a government official has to be able to 

say, I support Section 230 reform because I'm 

concerned about these things, and also, in the 

meantime, I think platforms should be doing 

better.

 statement could be.  I'll acknowledge, as you 

say, context matters a ton, and so I don't want

 to say it's impossible.  All I'm saying is it

 didn't happen here.

 The President said this to the public 

in the middle of a pandemic, and then three days

 later -- I think this is important -- he 

clarified. He said, I'm not saying Facebook is 

killing people.  I'm saying the people spreading 

misinformation are. 

And when he was asked will you hold 

the platforms accountable, he was explicitly 

asked this, will you hold them accountable if 

they don't do better, he said, I'm not looking

 which coercion kicks in?  I mean, if you're 

trying to coerce or get a particular result out 

of a media outlet, is it enough to say, you

 know, if you don't do this, we're going to move

 your reporter's cubicle down the hall?  Or -- I

 mean, how do you evaluate when it constitutes 

coercion in this context?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So let me start with I 

think Bantam Books has been the lodestar for the 

lower courts that have mostly coalesced, with 

some errors in application like this case, 

around the idea of the question is, is it a 

threat or a statement that a reasonable person 

would understand, viewed objectively and in 

context, as an implicit or explicit threat of 

some adverse government action. 

Now, as to the cubicles question, I --

I sort of don't know if there are some adverse 

government actions that are so trivial that they 

don't count.  I guess I think something like 

that seems less likely to be a coercive threat. 

But -- but, in general, I think our 

position is, if there's something that the 

government is saying that we're going to 

exercise government power in some way unless you

change your speech in some way or stop 

distributing the speech of others, if it's 

reasonably understood as that sort of a threat, 

that's a First Amendment problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but,

 under Bantam -- Bantam Books, it -- it

 presumably is in context, what you're talking 

about, a reasonable person. I mean, if there 

is, as a regular basis, the kind of back and 

forth between a spokesman and -- and a member of 

the media, what a reasonable person might view 

as -- as coercive might not in that context, you 

know -- you know, maybe the press secretary 

yells on a regular basis, and if their, you 

know, volume increases enough, that might be 

viewed as coercion. 

MR. FLETCHER: So I think that points 

out the context sensitivity.  And I think, as is 

usually the case when the Court says it's a 

reasonable person test, it's a reasonable person 

with knowledge of all the facts, and I think 

that would include the prior course of dealing 

between the relevant government official and the 

relevant recipient.

 coercion.  These were sophisticated parties.

 They routinely said no to the government.  They

 were open about it.  They didn't hesitate to do

 it. And when they said no to the government, 

the government never engaged in any sort of

 retaliation.  Instead, it engaged in more

 speech.  Ultimately, the President and the Press

 Secretary and the Surgeon General took to the 

bully pulpit.  We just don't think that's 

coercive.

 independent judgment, that's what the First

 Amendment protects.  It says we don't want the

 government messing with --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So you're saying that

 you can't -- the government can't censor by 

coordinating with private parties to exclude 

other speech? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I'm saying that when 

the government persuades a private party not to 

distribute or promote someone else's speech, 

that's not censorship; that's persuading a 

private party to do something that they're 

lawfully entitled to do, and there are lots of 

contexts where government officials can persuade 

private parties to do things that the officials 

couldn't do directly. 

So, for example, you know, in --

recently, after the October 7th attacks in 

Israel, a number of public officials called on 

colleges and universities to do more about 

anti-Semitic hate speech on campus. I'm not

Internet companies to watch out for child

 pornography on their platforms even if the 

Fourth Amendment would prevent the government

 from doing that directly. 

All of those are contexts where the 

government can persuade a private party to do 

something that the private party's lawfully 

entitled to do, and we think that's what the 

government is doing when it's saying to these 

platforms, your platforms and your algorithms 

and the way that you're presenting information 

is causing harm and we think you should stop,

is a difference between those two things, I 

guess my argument here would be that what 

happened is on the persuasion side of the line 

because you do see that back and forth of the

 platforms throughout the process saying no

 repeatedly when they disagree with what the

 government is asking them to do, and I think

 that that tells you that what was happening here 

is what the First Amendment protects, which is 

private speakers making independent judgment 

informed by, maybe even influenced by, the 

government but deciding it themselves. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So there's no 

difference between the platforms meeting and 

working out an arrangement not to permit certain 

speech and the platforms working with the 

government to do the exact same thing?  There's 

no difference? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think, if -- if 

the platforms entered into some agreement 

amongst themselves, that might raise issues 

under different provisions of the law, that

traceability of all of the past moderation of 

their content that they talk about, but I think

 we're on even stronger ground in saying that the 

vast majority of the things they're talking

 about are about COVID-19 or unusual,

 idiosyncratic stories from the 2020 election, 

and their burden is to show that they face an 

imminent threat -- that's from Lyons, that's 

from O'Shea -- that the injury is going to 

recur. That's Clapper II. 

And what Clapper also says -- and this 

is instructive -- is that to the extent they're 

censoring themselves, which is what they say, in 

the absence of such an imminent threat of actual 

government-caused harm, that's not enough for

 MR. FLETCHER:  And -- and when I tried 

to go through the red brief, pages 19 to 21, and

 connect up the dots here, one of the things 

that's hard is that there's not a lot of

 specifics about even the dates on when things

 happened.

 I guess I will say, when the dates are

 provided, though, they don't line up. The very 

first example on page 19 of the red brief is, 

I -- I think it's Ms. Hines, she gets her 

retweet of Robert F. Kennedy, Junior, suppressed 

by Twitter and she says, that's an indication 

that my harms are traceable to the government 

because the government was talking about Robert 

F. Kennedy, Junior. 

But she doesn't say that the 

government's statements happened between January 

and July of 2021, and the moderation of her 

retweet happened in April of 2023, years later, 

after Twitter had been sold, after it had 

abandoned the COVID-19 moderation policies that 

are at issue here. 

I think that's a strong indication 

that there's a real traceability problem, and it

If there were specific factual findings beyond

there clear error, but things like this was 

pressure, this was coercion, we think those are 

characterizations.

2022. The place where I think I know for sure 

that the PI matters, though, is whether they've 

shown a likelihood of irreparable harm which 

above and beyond standing is a requisite for 

injunctive relief.  I think that has to be shown 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That is at the PI

MR. FLETCHER:  -- at the PI. Exactly. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  So we --

that's the relevant date? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

when we're looking at coercion, is it in your

is very concentrated and -- and that, therefore,

 coordination problems that otherwise might be

 difficult with the media, which are very

 diverse, might not be present in some cases?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So, again, context

 matters.  And I think, in some ways, the fact

 that this is -- these are very large, very 

powerful corporations cuts against a finding of

 coercion because they are very sophisticated, 

they didn't have any problem, they weren't shy 

about saying no to the government. 

I -- I hesitate to say, though, that 

it suggests that you should change the First 

Amendment standards.  I think the Knight brief

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm not suggesting 

that. The Knight brief does discuss this and 

says it might be a relevant factor that there's 

such a concentration that it makes coordination 

between government entities and private entities 

easier. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So -- but I --

the constitutional line is between coercion and

 not coercion.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, I understand

 that.

 MR. FLETCHER:  And so the -- the

 question --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But in the context-

specific inquiries we've discussed --

MR. FLETCHER:  Right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- you've pointed 

out one way in which concentration might make it 

less susceptible to coercion.  Do we have to 

account for the possibility as well that in some 

circumstances -- and I'm not -- again, not 

case-specific -- it might make -- may -- may 

make coercion easier? 

MR. FLETCHER: So, if that were true, 

you would have to account for it.  The reason 

I'm resisting is because I think the concerns 

about concentration in the industry go more to 

the potential effects of coercion if it happened 

than about whether or not coercion happened at 

all. 

I get that. I'm sensitive to that,

 an example of a valuable sort of interchange as 

long as it stays on the persuasion side of the

 line. I think plat- -- newspapers want to know 

if their publishing a story might put lives at

 risk. And they don't have to listen to the 

government, but that's information that they can 

consider in exercising their editorial judgment.

onto that:  And if you publish the story, we're

the media to talk about things they don't like 

or don't want to see or are complaining about

 factual inaccuracies.  But -- I'd be interested 

in what you want to describe about that.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So I think 

that's absolutely right, and I won't profess to

 give you a comprehensive overview.  We've looked 

at this very carefully in the context of these 

defendants because we've a couple times been 

under the shadow of this injunction, and so we 

wanted to understand exactly what would be at 

stake there. 

And so I think it -- it comes into a 

couple of different buckets.  One of them is 

engagement on matters of public policy, and I 

think that's what was going on here.  I think 

childhood mental health, anti-Semitic speech, 

Islamophobic speech online are in that category. 

Those are issues where the White House, the 

Surgeon General, others, might want to make 

their views known, to use the bully pulpit to 

call on the platforms to do more. 

Another is the national security 

space. I think the record is clearest there on

 There's also a domestic law

 enforcement side of things, child exploitation,

 other things like that.  The platforms are a 

vector for those sorts of activities, and the 

government communicates with them about that. 

There's also election integrity

places, or manners of elections, saying, you 

know, the polls have closed early, don't bother 

coming to vote, in an effort to suppress

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So this might be a 

question about the distinction or the interplay

what, we're partners, we're on the same team, 

this is a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, and we 

think it would be most efficient and most 

helpful for the public good for us to just turn

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- on Facebook's

 part, but it -- wouldn't it be state action

 then?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So, to me, it starts to 

veer over, and, obviously, with all the caveats,

 state action is incredibly context-specific.  I

 don't want to be definitive. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure. 

MR. FLETCHER:  But, to me, that starts 

to verge more over into the joint action. We're 

doing something together.  The government is 

doing things.  It's actually making decisions. 

It's not just advising or persuading the 

platforms. 

I -- I think the rubric may -- that 

well be state act action, but the rubric would 

be I think more sound in the joint action cases 

than under significant encouragement, which has 

never been just us trying to persuade you to do 

something. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  How do we consider 

the relationship between those two things? 

Because I agree with you Bantam Books is about

 coercion and drawing the line there.  But,

 clearly, there are some times when things veer 

into the joint action space where we would say 

that maybe there was state action. And there's

 a dispute in this case -- it kind of comes up in 

the next one too -- about which framework is the

 right one. What advice do you have?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So, again, I 

think, if I were the Court, I would want to be 

cautious about making too definitive 

pronouncements.  I would say that here, what's 

challenged is the persuasion, exhortation, bully 

pulpit provision of advice, provision of 

information, and that when those things are at 

issue, the main yardstick is going to be Bantam 

Books. The main concern is going to be have you 

crossed the line from just really trying to 

persuade to trying to threaten and that Bantam 

is the right way to draw that line. 

I think there are a lot of different 

amicus briefs from a lot of different parties, 

like the Chamber and NetChoice, they all agree 

that's the right line in this context. 

I think you could reserve and say it 

would be a very different question if you're

Justice Kagan that we really, to address the 

standing point, don't have to review any of the 

district court's factual findings for clear 

error.

that's right because I'm thinking about things

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, if the lower

 courts, which I think they did, kind of 

conflated some of those threats with threats

 that were designed to be threats related to the

 pandemic and that kind of suppression, wouldn't 

that then be clear error, or do you think that's 

application of facts to law or what? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I apologize.  I

might agree clear error applies, but to the

 extent that the lower courts were suggesting,

 and -- and, really, more the district court than 

the Fifth Circuit, but a little bit the Fifth 

Circuit too, that things were said to speakers 

that weren't said, that the Press Secretary said

 words she never said, our argument there would 

just be that those are clear error.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, in considering 

traceability, you would say that maybe there are 

some things that we would review for clear error 

because the erroneous -- assuming that you're 

right, the erroneous conclusions about 

traceability depended partly on factual errors 

and then partly on applications of law to fact? 

MR. FLETCHER:  And -- and an incorrect 

legal standard, yeah.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I didn't

the way to go, that Blum is not the right test.

And I appreciate that Blum uses

 significant encouragement, but I think it says

 the question is whether the government "has

 provided such significant encouragement, either

 overt or covert, that the choice must in law be 

deemed that of the state," that it's sort of 

suggesting in the same way that Bantam Books 

is that it's really about coercion, as opposed

 to just encouragement. 

So am I wrong to think there's really 

not that much difference between the two? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I don't think 

you're wrong there. I think we say that that's 

the way you ought to read the "significant 

encouragement" language, that it's positive 

incentives of government action that overwhelm 

the private party's choice and make it really 

the government's choice, not the private 

party's.  You can just view that as the flip 

side of the sort of coercive threats from Bantam 

Books. 

I think the reason why you may have 

sensed me today and us in our briefs resisting 

Blum is because the lower courts and my friends 

on the other side have really tried to turn that

 something quite different, into circumstances

 where the government encourages in some 

colloquial sense by urging or persuading or, you

 know, really strongly advocating something.  And 

we just don't think that's what Blum means or 

what this Court's state action cases have ever

 said.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  I understand 

that. And even if we have a world in which 

significant encouragement is verboten, is there

think could be taken away from their view, which 

is that in situations in which the government 

has information that may be unique to the 

government's knowledge but that it feels 

important for the public to have, that that 

somehow becomes prohibited if, as a result of 

that information, these companies decide they're 

going to do something different with respect to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BENJAMIN AGUIÑAGA 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Government censorship has no place in 

our democracy.  That is why this 20,000-page 

record is stunning.  As the Fifth Circuit put 

it, the record reveals unrelenting pressure by 

the government to coerce social media platforms 

to suppress the speech of millions of Americans.

the most massive attack against free speech in 

American history, including the censorship of 

renowned scientists opining in their areas of

 expertise.

 And the government's levers of 

pressure are anathema to the First Amendment. 

Behind closed doors, the government badgers the

 platforms 24/7, it abuses them with profanity,

 it warns that the highest levels of the White 

House are concerned, it ominously says that the 

White House is considering its options, and it 

accuses platforms both of playing total 

Calvinball and of hiding the ball, all to get 

the platforms to censor more speech.  Under this 

onslaught, the platforms routinely cave. 

Now, last month, in the NetChoice 

cases, the platforms told you that it's 

incredibly important that they create their own 

content moderation policies.  But this record 

shows that they continually depart from those 

policies because of unrelenting government 

pressure. 

Indeed, as Facebook recently disclosed

Minister Nick Clegg, the reason Facebook did

that was "because we were under pressure by the

 administration.  We shouldn't have done it."

 Now my friend says all this is 

constitutional because the government has the

 right to persuade using the bully pulpit.  But 

the government has no right to persuade

 platforms to violate Americans' constitutional 

rights, and pressuring platforms in back rooms

 shielded from public view is not using the bully 

pulpit at all. That's just being a bully. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, the -- I 

know your argument is basically a Bantam Book 

argument, but do you need coercion in order to 

-- do you think that's the only way you could 

make your case, or could you -- coordination 

accomplish the same thing; that is, the 

government is censoring by joint actions with 

the platforms as opposed to coercing the 

platforms? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, we don't 

need coercion as a theory.  That's why we led 

with encouragement in our red brief.  And I 

would point the Court to what it said in 

Norwood, which is the Court -- or the -- the

government cannot induce, encourage, and promote 

private actors to do directly what the 

government can't itself do directly.

 And that's, I think, the principle 

that's guiding here, which is, regardless of the

 means that the government tries to use to

 pressure -- to pressure the platforms to commit 

censorship against third parties, the

 Constitution really doesn't care about that. 

It's the fact that what the government is trying 

to accomplish is the suppression of speech. 

And I would say, Your Honor, I mean, 

that's exactly how you addressed this question 

in Bantam Books.  You asked, did the government 

set out to deliberately suppress speech?  The 

answer in that case was absolutely yes, and 

that's absolutely the answer in this case here. 

And I guess, you know, I -- I would 

say, you know, when this Court considered Bantam 

Books, one of the key things about the analysis 

in Bantam Books was that it was an obscenity 

case, and, you know, the Court struggled with 

whether the states had the right to police the 

line between legitimate speech and illegitimate 

speech.  And that was why you were talking about

 the states went too far --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm sorry.

 The reason we were asking about coercion is 

because the private parties could have chosen on

 their own to censor that speech. They could 

have said we think it's obscene, I'm not going 

to be involved in this. 

The only issue became when that choice 

was overridden by the government.  And so I -- I 

don't -- I -- I -- I think you're -- you're cite 

-- you're mixing sort of situations and -- and 

confusing legal doctrines. 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  No, Your Honor.  The 

fundamental principle -- and this comes from 

Norwood and it's central to this Court's First 

Amendment cases, its Fourth Amendment cases --

is that the government can't do indirectly what 

it's prohibited from doing directly. 

And that's what you see happening in 

Bantam Books.  That's what you see happening in 

a case like this because time and again there 

were times where the social media platforms had 

policies that didn't go far enough in censoring

application of our First Amendment 

jurisprudence, and there may be circumstances in

 which the government could prohibit certain

I mean, do you -- do you -- do you 

disagree that we would have to apply strict 

scrutiny and determine whether or not there is a 

compelling interest in how the government has 

tailored its regulation? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Certainly, Your Honor. 

I think, at the end of every First Amendment 

analysis, you'll have the strict scrutiny 

framework in which, you know, in some national 

security hypos, for example, the government may 

well be able to demonstrate a compelling 

interest, may well be able to demonstrate narrow 

tailoring, but the --

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Yeah, and I would say,

 in the mine-run case that you're describing to 

me, it's the government going after the speaker 

itself and trying to get them to change their

 speech.

 What's so pernicious here is that you

 don't see any of these facts in this record

 unless we get discovery, which is when the --

when Rob Flaherty, who's Deputy Assistant to the 

President, sends an email to Facebook or to 

Twitter and complains that they're not doing 

enough to censor what they view as vaccine 

hesitancy speech.  America never sees that. 

And the third party, people like Jill 

Hines and -- and Jim Hoft, whose speech wishes 

to express the kinds of viewpoints that the 

White House is targeting, they never know that 

that's happening behind the scenes. 

And I think it makes a difference, 

Justice Kagan, that you have an intermediary 

here who really has no incentive to itself 

defend Jim Hoft's speech or to defend Jill

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  And I guess there are a 

number of ways I would think about that, Your 

Honor. One is, if the newspaper declines to run 

an op-ed because the government asked, that 

op-ed author can go to any number of other 

publications and it has an outlet. 

It's not the same here because, if I'm

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just 

going to say, first, I have no experience

 coercing anybody. 

(Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but, 

second, I mean, the government is not monolithic

 either.  I suspect, when there's pressure put on 

one of the platforms or certainly one of the

 other media outlets, they have people they go 

to, probably in the government, to say: Hey, 

they're -- they're trying to get me to do this, 

and that person may disagree with what the 

government's trying to do this.  It's not 

monolithic.  And that has to dilute the concept 

of coercion significantly, doesn't it? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, I -- I'm 

not sure I agree with that.  And I guess I'd get 

back to one of the earlier points I made, which 

is, you know, whether you call this coercion, if 

that's the label you attach, you call it 

encouragement, you call it promotion, you call 

it inducement, whatever it is, if the government 

is attempting to abridge the -- the speech 

rights of a third party, that has to be 

unconstitutional because that falls within the

platform about something, and the Army Corps of 

Engineers is trying to coerce them the other

FBI was sending Teleporter encrypted messages to

represents was foreign actors.  The -- the

distinguishing between whether it was domestic 

or foreign conduct.

people who wish to retweet that, repost that, 

with their own comments, saying, heck, yeah, I

 love Biden too.  When an American does that, 

that's First Amendment protected speech, Your 

Honor. And so, when the government comes in and 

tries to take down every single post that 

contains the core that they say was foreign 

speech, but they're also taking down the -- the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, now I don't know

 what your standard is. You just told me that

 that was -- that was good enough for you.

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  No --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That was coercion.

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  No, Your Honor, 

because, you know, in that circumstance, you 

have a platform who is reaching out -- or the 

government reaching out just to -- to identify 

what it views as the right state of the law, 

right state of facts. 

The government -- I mean this Court 

has made clear for -- for a while, since its 

plurality opinion in Alvarez, that if the 

government thinks there's false speech out 

there, the remedy for that is true speech. 

Nothing prohibits the government from going to 

that platform and saying we've seen a lot of

 The problem here -- and this is -- you

 know, I -- I think you see this in the summer of 

2021 after the White House goes nuclear on the

 platforms -- is that the platforms themselves

 reverse course on their own policies. And you 

see this in ROA 15322, this is one of the -- the

Nick Clegg, who is, you know, former Deputy 

Prime Minister of the UK, and after all of this 

pressure for months and months and months, he 

sends this email to Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon 

General, and he says:  Dear Vivek, thanks for 

taking the time to meet.  I wanted to make sure 

you saw the steps we took past -- this past week 

to adjust policies on what we're removing to 

take steps to further address the "Disinfo

groups, Instagram accounts.  We're continuing to 

make other accounts harder to find.

let me give you Jill Hines one more time. Look

 at JA 7 -- 793 to 794. This is the tweet

 that -- or it was a screenshot of a tweet that

 Mr. Fletcher mentioned.  And this is censorship 

four times over because this is a tweet in April

 2023. It's on the eve of the preliminary

 injunction hearing.  And what she says is: This 

Facebook post that I posted was taken down by

 Facebook.  She got a warning for it as a 

violation of the community standards. 

What was that post?  It was a 

screenshot of Robert F. Kennedy, Junior, who is 

a member of the so-called "Disinformation 

Dozen."  What was the RFK tweet talking about? 

It was talking about Tucker Carlson, whom the 

administration was obsessed with.  Look at JA 

701 to 708. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, the RFK 

tweet, the -- there's only a record of the White 

House asking Twitter to remove a tweet on -- and 

not particularly this one from R -- RFK.  That 

doesn't help Hines's claim that the White House 

asked Facebook to remove anything.

happened in this example is Jill Hines took a 

screenshot of a tweet, and then she moved that 

over to Facebook and posted that as her own

 Facebook post.  And so, when she did that, she

 moved RFK's tweet.

 And I was going to describe what was 

in that tweet. He was talking about Tucker 

Carlson, that the White House specifically 

targeted, in the Joint Appendix, and that --

the context of some of your claims. You 

attribute things to people who it didn't happen 

to. At least in one of the defendants, it was 

her brother that something happened to, not her. 

I don't know what to make of all this because 

you're -- you have a -- I'm not sure how we get 

to prove direct injury in any way.

responsibility for that. I apologize for that,

 Justice Sotomayor.

 What I would add to the second part of

 your question is I think Jill Hines is the best

 standing for case -- for our case in multiple

 ways. I think one of the ways you look at her 

standing is you look at JA 715 to 716. This is 

an email to Facebook where the government, the

 White House, specifically asks Facebook to not 

distribute so-called vaccine hesitancy content 

and also to target health groups that do that. 

So that's JA 715 to 716. 

Then you go down earlier in the JA to 

JA 631 to 632. This is Jill Hines's 

allegations.  And what she says is, two months 

later -- so the email I described from you -- to 

you from the White House was in May -- two 

months later in July and then a couple of months 

later in September, Jill Hines had two health 

groups in Louisiana that were blocked by 

Facebook. 

And I think this is one of the 

scariest examples in the record of what is at 

stake here, which is those groups were political 

action groups.  Louisiana had a legislative

trying to do is mobilize people to support

 certain bills and other legislative materials

 that were then pending in the state legislature.

 But, because the government moved its

 pressure, put a thumb on the scales, you know, a 

couple of months before and then, lo and behold,

 once Jill Hines tries to use the exact kinds of 

groups that the government targeted, she can't. 

They're pulled down.  Her political organization 

is stymied.  And that's, you know, all over the 

record, and that's just one fraction of -- of 

the kinds of harm that's at stake here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, go ahead. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I -- I want to go

confess it left me very confused.  It sounded 

like you are articulating different standards 

depending on -- a different legal standard 

depending on different factual circumstances.

For example, when Justice Kagan gave 

you the hypothetical of pressure being placed on 

The New York Times or The Washington Post not to

 run a particular op-ed, it seemed like you 

backed off and said, well, significant

 encouragement wouldn't be enough there because 

the person who wrote the op-ed can go to another

 news outlet.

 You also made the point that this is 

just different because social media is such a 

concentrated industry, which is a point that 

Justice Gorsuch was asking Mr. Fletcher about. 

So can you clarify?  Did I -- did I 

misunderstand?  Because it seems to me that as a 

matter of law, the same legal standard would 

have to apply across all of these areas. 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  I think that's right, 

Your Honor. And I apologize if I wasn't clear 

earlier. 

I guess the top-line legal standard I 

would start with was this Court's line at 635 in 

Norwood, which is the Court can't do indirectly 

what it's constitutionally prohibited from doing 

directly. 

The second line in response to that

is, well, what sorts of indirect mechanisms can 

the government use that would run afoul of that

 rule?

 I think one potential mechanism is

 coercion.  Another one is encouragement.  This 

Court also has used the term inducement --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Just plain vanilla 

encouragement, or does it have to be some kind

 of, like, significant encouragement?  Because 

encouragement would sweep in an awful lot. 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  I think that's right, 

Your Honor. And so let me give you two answers 

to that.  The top-line answer is, I mean, I'm a 

First Amendment purist and so I would say even 

mild encouragement, but we don't need that to 

win in this case because we are so far afield 

from whatever that -- that threshold is. 

So, if you want to say substantial 

encouragement like the Fifth Circuit said and 

like Blum said, absolutely.  That's a standard 

that works. 

But I guess what I -- I don't --

JUSTICE BARRETT: Well, let me just --

let me just ask you then, let me give you a 

hypothetical.  Let's say that you get doxed and

 those kinds of calls?

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  And that's why -- and 

that's why I have my backup answer -- answer,

 Your Honor, which is, if you think there needs 

to be more, the FBI absolutely can identify

 certain troubling situations like that for the 

platforms and let the platforms take action. 

I think we're -- you know, the hypos 

are very important, but when you look at what's 

happening in this case, for example, with 

respect to the FBI, what they're doing is not --

there's no emergency, nothing of the sort. 

They're just identifying hundreds of accounts --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But that's just kind 

of falling back on, well, this case is 

different, this case is different, and so a 

different legal standard should apply.  But, you 

know, what we say in this case matters for other 

cases too.

sensitive obviously given the facts of the hypo 

to the outcome, but if what the FBI is doing is

 trying to persuade an intermediary -- a speech

 intermediary to take down a private third 

party's speech, I mean, that is the -- that is 

covered by the plain text of Norwood, and

 that's, I mean, an abridgement of speech.

 And I -- you know, I --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I think -- I 

think that part of the reason why you might be 

running into all of these difficulties with 

respect to the different factual circumstances 

is because you're not focusing on the fact that 

there are times in which the government can, 

depending on the circumstances, encourage, 

perhaps even coerce, because they have a 

compelling interest in doing so. 

And so that's why I keep coming back 

to the actual underlying First Amendment issue, 

which we can isolate in this case and just talk 

about -- about coercion, but I think there --

that you have to admit that there are certain 

circumstances in which the government can 

provide information, encourage the platforms to 

take it down, tell them to take it down.

I understand that the bully pulpit has never 

been used to target the object of suppressing a

 third party's speech.

 You can use it to coerce behavior.

 You can use it to coerce companies to take

 certain actions.  But, when the government is

 identifying a specific viewpoint and specific

 content that it wishes to wholly eliminate from 

public discourse, that's, I think, when the 

First Amendment problem arises. 

And so I -- I -- I guess -- I'm 

struggling to find an example in the Court's 

cases or in history where the Court or anybody 

else has said: The government, by virtue of 

being the government, can use its power to 

pressure speech intermediaries to eliminate 

entire viewpoints and -- and -- and content from 

the public discourse.

that there is an emergency, and I guess I'm 

asking you, in that circumstance, can the 

government call the platforms and say: This 

information that you are putting up on your 

platform is creating a serious public health 

emergency, we are encouraging you to take it 

down? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  I -- I was with you 

right until that last comment, Your Honor.  I 

think they absolutely can call and say this is a 

problem, it's going rampant on your platforms, 

but the moment that the government tries to use 

its ability as the government and its stature as 

the government to pressure them to take it down, 

that is when you're interfering with the third

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, I was just

 going to say even -- remember that the third

being targeted and ultimately censored is absent 

from this discussion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you 

don't think -- well, do you think that simply 

that Justice Jackson's hypothetical ended by 

saying we encourage you to take it down, is that 

rise to the level of coercion that you think is 

problematic? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, if the test 

is coercion and that's the test that this Court 

applies, I think I might have a harder case 

saying that's coercion.  I think it's -- by its 

definition, it's maybe easier addressed as a 

substantial encouragement case.

But if -- you know, whether -- as I 

said earlier, regardless of the label that you 

apply, whether it's coercion, whether it's 

encouragement, or joint participation and 

conspiracy, at the end of the day, if what the

 government is trying to do is to eliminate

 viewpoints from public discourse, that I think

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, again, 

under my colleague's hypothetical, it was not 

necessarily eliminate viewpoints.  It was to 

eliminate instructions, let's say, about how to 

engage in some game that is seriously harming 

children around -- around the country, and they 

say we -- we encourage you to stop that. 

I mean, is it -- that violates the 

Constitution? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, I agree, as 

a policy matter, it might be great for the 

government to be able to do that, but the moment 

that the government identifies an entire 

category of content that it wishes to not be in 

the modern public sphere, that is a First 

Amendment problem.

 Justice Thomas?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Aguiñaga, I 

think some of your most recent colloquy with my 

colleagues have gotten off into questions that I 

didn't take it from your brief we -- you think 

we actually need to decide in this case.

 So I thought your principal argument 

was that whatever coercion means, it -- what 

happened here is sufficient and that coercion 

doesn't mean only -- it doesn't apply only when 

the government says do this, and if you don't do 

this, there are going to be legal consequences 

when it says that in the same breath but that 

it's a more flexible standards and you --

standard and you have to take into account the 

whole course of the relationship regarding this 

matter. 

That's what I -- I took to be your 

principal argument.  Did I understand that 

correctly? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  That's correct, Your 

Honor. And there's an entire volume -- I mean,

government persistently going back to platforms

 again and again, pushing them to adjust their

 policies, change their policies, do more

 censoring.

 And I think that's what makes this 

case so unique, is that you not only have this

 vast repetition of communications, but it's

 all -- again, the bulk of it is behind closed

 doors. And that's what's so pernicious about 

this, is that if we don't have a remedy in this 

case, then it's hard to see how there will ever 

be a remedy for a future plaintiff who turns out 

to be censored, but it's difficult for that 

person to even identify whether that censoring 

actually happened.

 for the single piece of evidence -- and maybe

 this is the -- the -- the piece that you were

 describing earlier.  I just wanted to make clear

 what your answer was. The single piece of

 evidence that most clearly shows that the 

government was responsible for one of your 

clients having material taken down, what is that

 evidence and, you -- you know, what does it say 

about how the government was responsible? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Sure, Your Honor.  So, 

as I say, I think Jill Hines is the best example 

for us on standing.  To give you one more 

example, look at page --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, but even on that 

one, I guess I just didn't understand in what 

you were saying how you drew the link to the 

government. I mean, we know that there's a lot 

of government encouragement around here.  We 

also know that there's -- the platforms are 

actively content moderating, and they're doing 

that irrespective of what the government wants. 

So how do you decide that it's 

government action as opposed to platform action?

 clearest way, and -- if I understand -- so let

 me answer your question directly, Your Honor.

 The way -- the -- the link that I was

 drawing there was a temporal one.  If you look 

at JA 715 to 716, that's a May 2021 email. Two 

months later after that email, calls for

 targeting health groups just like Jill Hines's 

group. She experiences the first example of 

that kind of group being taken down. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So, in two 

months, I mean, a lot of things can happen in 

two months.  So that decision two months later 

could have been caused by the government's 

email, or that government email might have been 

long since forgotten because, you know, there 

are a thousand other communications that 

platform employees have had with each other, 

that -- a thousand other things that platform 

employees have read in the newspaper. 

I mean, why would we point to one 

email two months earlier and say it was that 

email that made all the difference? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor -- and I 

would say a thousand other emails between the 

White House and Facebook in those two months.  I

 either way.  I think what we do know --

 right.

 MR. AGUIÑAGA: I think what we do know

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, you can say 

that about pretty much everything that's in your

communication. 

The government is making some broad 

statements about the kinds of communications it

on its own about various kinds of communications 

it thinks harmful. 

I guess, if you're going to use 

standard ideas about traceability and 

redressability, I guess what I'm suggesting is I 

don't see a single item in your briefs that 

would satisfy our normal tests. 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  So, Your Honor, look at 

Jill Hines, and I'll give you one more example.

 and the Gateway Pundit specifically appear in 

the tracking spreadsheet that CISA uses, that 

the FBI uses as well. And we also know that the 

EIP, the Election Integrity Partnership, that 

works with CISA, and the government -- the

Hoft and from Jill Hines that identify the 

specific posts that they had posted on Twitter 

and Facebook during the pending preliminary

 injunction proceedings.

 One of the ones we talked about was JA

 74 -- 793 and 794, which is the -- the Jill 

Hines Facebook post referencing RFK, referencing 

Tucker Carlson, referencing vaccines.  It's --

it's turtles all the way down. And that is an 

example, and all of these are examples, of 

injuries that postdate a lot of the earlier 

filings in this case. 

And so, you know, when you talk about 

redressability, Your Honor, this injunction is 

an order to the government not to continue 

engaging in the sorts of censorship that led to 

these kinds of censorship decisions. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Then I'd like to 

talk just briefly about remedy.  This is another 

example of a universal injunction, and the 

district court enjoined behavior by platforms 

that your clients didn't use and enjoined 

actions with respect to non-parties, not 

affecting your clients.

lately. What do we do about it?

 MR. AGUIÑAGA: So a couple of

 responses to that, Justice Gorsuch.

 I think one reason the breadth of the

 injunction is what it is is what the Fifth 

Circuit explained in JA 81 to 83, which is the 

breadth of the government's enterprise in this 

case was extremely broad.

 I mean, when it's identifying -- and I 

had this colloquy with Justice Kagan about 

whether you can identify them calling out Jill 

Hines specifically.  The reason it's hard for me 

to do that is because they weren't cutting at 

that -- at that level in the weeds.  What they 

were doing -- taking is broader strokes like 

vaccines are safe for -- for children, calling 

that claim true, and then having the platforms 

go out and censor contrary claims. 

And so the reason you see the breadth 

of the injunction being the way it is, Your 

Honor, it's a product of what the government 

did. Now, if you --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, that's --

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  -- if you have concern

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- we hear that in

 every universal injunction case. But your

 clients are your clients.  They're the only ones

 complaining.  And it's their case.  It's their

 controversy.  And, normally, our -- our remedies

 are tailored to those who are actually

 complaining before us and not to those who

 aren't, right?

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, and if you 

have that concern, we're completely fine if you 

want to limit the injunction to the five 

platforms as to which we were able to get 

preliminary discovery.  That's completely fine 

with us.  If you want to limit just to the seven 

plaintiffs, also completely fine, Your Honor. 

I think the most important takeaway in 

this case is that the Court has to say something 

in our favor on the merits.  The government 

can't just run rampant pressuring the platforms 

to censor private speech.

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  I think that's right, 

Your Honor, although, if you look at page 66 to 

67, this Court used the term "coercion"

 alongside the term "persuasion" and

 "intimidation."  I mean, I think there is some 

flexibility in those terms, and you could -- you 

can imagine a world in which you can call

 persuasion another variety of encouragement. 

As I say, I'm not wedded to any label, 

we're not wedded to any label, but I do agree 

that the word "encouragement" doesn't appear in 

Bantam Books, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And one thing that 

I think I want to square up with you is if 

someone calls and -- or contacts the social 

media company and says what you have there, this 

post, has factually erroneous information, so 

not a viewpoint that we disagree with, factually 

erroneous information, and the social media 

company says, we'll take a look at that and --

encouragement that qualifies as coercion, if 

they take it down in response to it --

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  No, Your Honor, and 

this is where Bantam Books, I think, is good for 

us because it says you look through the forms to 

the substance.  And so you look at the substance 

of the communication and say, well, is what the 

government doing here, is it trying to 

effectively suppress a third-party's speech? 

And so, if the forms cut one way, but 

the substance cuts the other ways, then you look 

at the substance.

you know, you should take that down, it's 

factually inaccurate, it's harming the war

 more speech.  Publish the true speech that they

 think should counter what they view as false

 speech.  The government is not helpless here.

 It has tools as it -- at its disposal, and 

censorship has never been the default remedy for 

a perceived First Amendment violation.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What do you do

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Your Honor, it -- it

you could have a threatener who threatens the 

recipient, the recipient says no, and so the 

threatener packs their tent and walks away. 

That's still a First Amendment violation even 

though the recipient refused to comply.

on the other end of the line being a government

 official, so Bantam Books points out that the 

speech, the threat, the encouragement, if -- if 

that's, you know, what we can posit for this 

purpose, comes from someone with the authority

 to impose a sanction.

 Is that important in your view? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA: Your Honor, it -- I

 mean, it is and it isn't.  We think it's a 

relevant fact that if somebody like an FBI agent 

that is meeting regularly with the platforms is 

making these kinds of requests, that that's a 

fact that you have to take into consideration. 

Justice Sotomayor has a panel, a 

procuring panel decision called Okwedy versus 

Molinari in the Second Circuit that addressed 

this issue about authority, and the issue in 

that case was that the borough president of 

Staten Island didn't have authority to take down 

a particular billboard, but the court still said 

that the fact that the recipient thought that 

the borough president might be able to use 

whatever authority he did have to cause trouble 

for the billboard owner, that was enough.

that kind of authority, Your Honor, I think 

that's a critical fact that you have to take 

into account because, as I say, if it's somebody 

that Twitter doesn't know from Adam that's 

making the request, they're just going to ignore

 it. But if it's somebody --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I mean, if 

it's a staffer or even if it's somebody on the

230 or maybe that's what's in the platform's 

mind, but, you know, no authority to bring an 

antitrust suit or to try to change 230 or 

advocate for 230 changes, that doesn't matter?

 MR. AGUIÑAGA:  Two people -- two 

people below him, two people below him, he --

they can't unilaterally reform 230 or promulgate

 rulemakings, but they can engage in a process

 that itself is punishment basically.  I mean, 

imagine being on the receiving ends of Rob 

Flaherty for six months on end and these --

 receiving these kinds of emails. In some ways, 

it's the adverse consequences that were 

threatened and/or actually carried out. Was the 

process --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So we should focus 

less on authority or authority can kind of drop 

out. The point is, if it comes from the 

government, and so there might be some 

conceivable way in which the government could 

follow through in some sort of punitive way, 

that -- that's the relevant inquiry?

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So my biggest

 concern is that your view has the First

 Amendment hamstringing the government in 

significant ways in the most important time

 periods.

 I mean, what would -- what would you 

have the government do? I've heard you say a 

couple times that the government can post its 

own speech. But, in my hypothetical, you know, 

kids, this is not safe, don't do it, is not 

going to get it done. 

And so I guess some might say that the 

government actually has a duty to take steps to 

protect the citizens of this country, and you 

seem to be suggesting that that duty cannot 

manifest itself in the government encouraging or 

even pressuring platforms to take down harmful 

information. 

So can you help me?  Because I'm 

really -- I'm -- I'm really worried about that 

because you've got the First Amendment operating 

in an environment of threatening circumstances 

from the government's perspective, and you're 

saying that the government can't interact with 

the source of those problems.

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  And, Your Honor, I

 understand that instinct, and I guess what I'd 

tell you is that -- our position is not that the 

government can't interact with the platforms

 there. They can and they should in certain 

circumstances like that that present such

 dangerous issues for society and especially

 young people.

 But the way they do that has to be in 

compliance with the First Amendment, and I think 

that means they can give them all the true 

information that the platform needs and ask to 

amplify that and ask --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But you're 

just -- you're just saying that. I guess I 

thought when you say the way they do that is 

consistent with the First Amendment is that they 

have to show that they have a compelling 

interest to do what they're doing.  In other 

words, you -- you want us to take the line --

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  I see.

compulsion and encouragement, and what we're

that's not really the line.

 The line is does the government,

 pursuant to the First Amendment, have a 

compelling interest in doing things that result

 in restricting the speech in this way? That 

test, I think, takes into account all of these

 different circumstances, that we don't really 

care as much about how much the government is

 compelling or maybe we do but in the context of 

tailoring and not as sort of a freestanding 

inquiry that's overlaid on all of this. Does 

that make sense? 

MR. AGUIÑAGA:  It does, Your Honor. 

And I -- I apologize for missing your guidance 

earlier. 

So the way I think about that is I --

I've been discussing the standard and I thought 

we've all been discussing the standard on the 

front end of the analysis, which is, is there a 

First Amendment violation?  Is there an 

abridgement of speech? 

I guess I would conceptually think of 

strict scrutiny, narrow tailoring, compelling 

interest as coming in at the back end to say 

yes, maybe in the ordinary case, the government

 shouldn't have been permitted to undertake the 

kind of suppression of free speech that it did, 

but in this unique circumstance, it actually had 

a compelling interest, and it used narrowly 

tailored means to accomplish that interest.

 I mean, I think that's the fail-safe. 

If you're concerned with the breadth of our

 arguments, that's one fail-safe, which is no 

matter how broad the standard the Court adopts, 

there's always going to be strict scrutiny at 

the end of the line to save the government in 

times where it desperately needs to do the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  I'd like to start with a few points on 

standing and then address the merits and then 

try to step back and talk about the bigger

So, first, on standing, I have to

start with a clarification about Jill Hines's

 emails at pages 793 to 794 of the Joint

 Appendix.  I had misunderstood the cross-posting

 issue that my friend alluded to earlier.  I 

thought that was a moderation event by Twitter,

 not by Facebook.  I appreciate his 

clarification, and because we've been insistent 

on the lower court's turning square corners on 

the facts here, I wanted to make sure I did that 

too. I don't think that changes the fundamental 

point, though, because we're still talking about 

an act of moderation in April 2023, years after 

the last White House or any government speech 

targeting Mr. Kennedy's content, which happened 

back in 2021. 

And that, Justice Kagan, I think 

points out the problem that you highlighted, 

which is that they're trying to draw the 

connection between the government's acts here 

and the moderation that harmed them through 

timing, and the timing just isn't very good. 

And so I want to talk about the two best 

examples that he gave you, the one being 

Ms. Hines's groups on Facebook, and this is 

discussed at page 630 of the Joint Appendix.

Justice Kagan, you pointed out that

 her groups were moderated at least two and four 

months after the relevant exchange between

 Facebook and the government.  But it's actually

 worse than that.  The 2000 -- the May 2021 email 

from Facebook to the government says, we've 

already taken action on health groups to remove

 them from our recommendation feature.  It wasn't 

reporting on something it would do in the 

future.  It was reporting on something that was 

already done.  And it's even not clear from the 

email that Facebook was doing that because of 

any request from the government. It was a 

report of its own action. 

And then his next best example is Mr. 

Hoft and the appearance of Mr. Hoft on a 

spreadsheet that the Department of Homeland 

Security's CISA, a sub-agency, maintains.  This 

appears at Record on Appeal 17,016.  And the 

problem with that is twofold.  First, this is a 

tracking spreadsheet that monitors information 

sent from election officials to the platforms. 

This shows that the report was made by the 

Election Integrity Partnership, a private 

entity.  It wasn't a referral that was made by

 CISA, the federal agency.  CISA was just noting

 the existence of the referral.  And, second, as 

far as I'm aware, there's no indication in the 

record that the referenced piece of content was 

actually taken down at all.

 So I think that points up that what 

they just haven't shown is any injury traceable 

to the government, let alone an imminent risk of

 future injury. 

Second, on the merits, I think it's 

instructive to start with what my friend called 

one of the hottest documents.  This is Record on 

Appeal 15,322, the email exchange between 

Surgeon General Murthy and someone at Facebook 

because this is coming in that critical July 

2021 period, and what starts that email exchange 

is not any concern about the private email 

exchanges, the stuff that happened behind closed 

doors, antitrust reform, Section 230.  It's 

Facebook reaching out and saying we wanted to 

get in touch because of the President's 

statements about us, the reference to killing 

people, and because of the Surgeon General's 

health advisory on what platforms could be doing 

to be doing more along with others in society.

And I think what that highlights is 

that to the extent that the government had

 influence on the platforms here, and we

 acknowledge there are indications that it did,

 it's influence of the classic bully pulpit sort 

of President Reagan condemning pornography --

or, excuse me, President Bush condemning

 pornography, President Reagan condemning media

 about drugs and violence, Teddy Roosevelt 

condemning muckrakers.  Part of our 

constitutional tradition is that presidents and 

their close advisors have the ability, the 

authority to, in a non-coercive way, to speak 

their mind and call on the public to act.  And 

we think that's what was happening here. 

And, finally, if I could just step 

back and -- you know, my friend started by 

saying that this is a massive attack on free 

speech.  The lower courts called it a 

coordinated censorship campaign. I want to be 

clear, if those things had happened, they would 

be reprehensible.  It would be a huge problem. 

But we would think that before validating those 

sorts of charges against senior government 

officials and career employees spanning two

 different administrations, the lower courts

 would insist on a rigorous analysis of the facts 

and the law. And with all respect to the lower 

courts, we don't think that's happened here.  We

 don't think that's supported.

 We think the easiest way for this

 Court to resolve this case is on standing, on

 the for -- lack of forward-looking injury 

ground, Justice Kagan, that you and I discussed 

earlier.  But, to the extent that the Court does 

get to the merits, we'd urge you to make clear 

that government officials do not violate the 

First Amendment when they flag false information 

or malign foreign actors when they answer 

questions about public health advice or when 

they speak to the public on matters of public 

concern the way the President and the Surgeon 

General did. 

The First Amendment is a critical 

bulwark against government coercion, and that's 

important, but it is also important that Article 

III courts stay within the bounds of Article III 

and don't enjoin or chill legitimate and 

productive interactions between the government 

and the public.
