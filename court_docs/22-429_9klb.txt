 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-429, Acheson

 Hotels versus Laufer.

 Mr. Unikowsky.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Respondent does not face an imminent 

injury from the absence of accessibility 

information at the website of a hotel she has 

no interest in visiting.  Respondent faces 

neither an informational injury nor a stigmatic 

injury.  She does not face an informational 

injury because she has no use for the 

information she seeks.  She's not interested in 

going to the hotel, so she has no reason for 

information about whether it is accessible. 

Nor does she face a stigmatic injury. 

This Court has held that a person is 

injured when she is personally subject to 

unequal treatment.  But that requirement is not 

satisfied by a plaintiff who searches for hotel

comply with her interpretation of the ADA.

 Finally, the Court should decide the

 question presented in this case.  The circuits

 are divided.  The question is important.  The

 arguments are fully aired.  And if the Court 

doesn't decide the question here, it may not 

have another opportunity to do so.

 The Court should not bless a legal 

strategy of filing large numbers of lawsuits, 

settling almost all of them, and abandoning the 

rare case that threatens to create adverse 

precedent so as to facilitate the filing of 

another round of lawsuits. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: But Respondent says 

that she has withdrawn her suits.  So why 

should we decide this? I -- it seems as though 

it's -- it's finished. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, Respondent has 

withdrawn her suit.  I mean, she hasn't 

promised not to bring new suits in the future. 

And if she doesn't, another plaintiff 

presumably will. 

Respondent's position is that any

person with a disability with accessibility 

needs in America who visits a website can bring 

a lawsuit, so, presumably, another plaintiff

 will come forward and -- and start bringing the

 same claims.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, do you admit,

 though, that it would be easier to simply moot 

this out and wait on a suit that is still 

pending for another round to discuss standing? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I'm actually not 

really sure it would be easier because I think 

that even if the Court does what Respondent 

asked, it would still be a significant 

precedential decision. 

I mean, the Court would essentially be 

-- be blessing the legal strategy over our 

objection of filing large numbers of lawsuits 

and -- and abandoning them at the last minute, 

and that, I think, would create a template 

for -- for future plaintiffs to rely upon. 

So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, I -- I 

don't understand.  You admit that this 

plaintiff is not entitled to monetary relief. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The hotel is owned 

by a different entity now, correct?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so you would 

need a new plaintiff and you would need a new

 defendant --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to get a

 precedential -- to get a decision that's not 

advisory, because what you're saying to us, the 

issue is important.  This plaintiff gets 

nothing.  The defendant has to be different 

because it's a different entity running it. 

So tell me why it's not moot and tell 

me why we wouldn't be just giving an advisory 

opinion. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So, if there was ever 

a live controversy, it's definitely moot at 

this point.  We're not disputing that, Your 

Honor. 

What we're simply saying is that there 

was never a live controversy in the first place 

and the Court should therefore so hold. In 

other words, the Court should say that whether 

it's moot is sort of immaterial because, from

day one, there wasn't a case or controversy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm sorry, I 

don't know why you haven't answered -- haven't

 answered my question.  Why isn't this purely

 advisory once there's no longer a live 

controversy between the parties before us?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I don't think it's an

 advisory opinion at all, Your Honor.  Both

 parties agree that the correct disposition of 

this case is to hold that there's no Article 

III case or controversy.  We simply disagree on 

the reasoning for that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there's 

prudential doctrines.  Standing is one of them. 

Mootness is another.  But I'm -- I'm unaware of 

any case where this Court had a standing and 

mootness issue and decided standing rather than 

mootness first. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Your Honor, I'm -- I'm 

not sure there's been a case in this particular 

configuration that's arrived at the Court 

before, but I don't think that there is a 

dispute in this case that the Court has the 

jurisdiction to decide either of the Article --

yes, we can decide either --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes. It's -- it's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and so I'm 

asking you in what case have we ever done this

 before, decided standing, which is a 

substantive question, when there's no live

 controversy before us?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I don't think the

 Court has decided on this particular 

constellation of facts a standing issue. But, 

again, both parties agree that there's no case 

or controversy.  The only question is why. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I suppose 

logically standing is an antecedent question to 

mootness, right?  You can't have something moot 

until you have a case. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That's correct, Your 

Honor. I think that the first question the 

Court should decide in the case is whether 

there is a case or controversy in the first 

place. 

The concept of mootness almost 

presupposes that at some point it wasn't moot. 

And we think that this case -- there was no 

case or controversy in this case from day one.

That's the question the Court granted

 certiorari to decide.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But we've

 never done that before is what I understood 

your answer to Justice Sotomayor to be. So, if 

it's sort of a logical antecedent, why -- why 

hasn't this Court set it up in that way?

 It would seem to me the question is 

which is the easier resolution, and so, to the 

extent that you both agree that this is moot, 

why isn't that just the end of it? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, Your Honor, in 

terms of have -- not having done it before, 

it's -- it's very unusual for a plaintiff to --

for a respondent to prevail in the court of 

appeals to abandon her claim in the Supreme 

Court. That comes up very rarely. 

And I don't think I've ever seen a 

case quite like this one where the seeming 

purpose of the abandonment of the case is to 

allow other plaintiffs to --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand 

that. But, when it happens -- you know, the --

cases do get mooted, and when it happens, the

case is moot. You agree the case is moot.

 So I guess I -- with at least circling

 back to Justice Thomas's question, why doesn't

us to take on extra work to end a case when

 we've all agreed it has to be ended, and,

 ordinarily, that would be all.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't the remedy for

 that Munsingwear, though?  I mean, shouldn't

 your -- shouldn't your answer be moot the case 

and vacate the lower court ruling to the extent

 there is one against us? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I don't think that's 

good enough, Your Honor, because, first of all, 

the First Circuit's case is still going to be 

persuasive authority to all district courts in 

the First Circuit, who are going to know that 

if the case goes back up, then, presumably --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, but that's 

what the Munsingwear remedy is about, isn't it? 

I mean, it's -- it's -- it's so that you don't 

solve -- suffer any harm, we vacate the lower 

court opinion because, if you're right, there 

was some kind of tactical strategy here, and 

then we all go home. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, remember that 

Ms. Laufer's victory in the Fourth Circuit 

remains binding precedent in that court.  And I 

just think this case is different because it's 

part of a broader litigation program of 

bringing hundreds and hundreds of lawsuits. 

That's what I think makes this case unique.

The mootness question of whether or

mootness papers weren't filed until after the 

Petitioner's opening brief. 

And we certainly have the authority 

under our precedent to decide, if you have two

manipulate the Court's jurisdiction by, after 

the Court's granted cert, mooting out the case.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I agree with that,

 Your Honor.  And I think that if the Court were 

to write a precedential decision addressing

 or -- or, you know, agreeing with Respondent's

objections as well --

So, yes, there may have been a bad 

tactic in place, but you're ascribing a motive 

to other people before it's happened.  And in 

every other case, I don't think every case

subject to a sanctions order in this is 

Mr. Gillespie, who's the -- the local counsel

I think that in other cases with other

 plaintiffs, I'm not suggesting there's going to 

be false statements to courts and opposing 

counsel, but the fundamental program here is to 

-- to file large numbers of lawsuits and settle 

almost all of them.  Even, you know, ethical 

ADA lawyers do that. 

And I think the Court should be 

concerned that whether that's permissible will 

not see the -- the bright lights of appellate 

review if the Court blesses a strategy of 

abandoning these cases in the rare situation 

where the defendant decides to litigate the 

case all the way up and there's a possibility

 But, in the district court, when you

 have two -- you know, if you have a more

 difficult issue and an easier issue -- and I'll

 just assume for present purposes that mootness

 is easier -- you know, the district court 

doesn't know if the issue's going to arise

 again.

 You know, when, in Pearson, we got rid 

of the Saucier two-step, we said, well, listen, 

you know, he doesn't know, a higher court may 

be considering the issue, the district court is 

delving in and expending all these resources on 

something that may never come up. 

But institutionally, if we're thinking 

about allocation of resources, it seems to me 

that that might be different here because I 

take it what you're saying is that there's an 

entrenched split that we're going to have to 

decide at some point, and significant resources 

have already been invested in this case, and 

you filed your opening brief before the 

suggestion of mootness was filed, thereby 

investigating -- yeah -- sorry, investing 

resources, and that we're going to have to do

this all over again.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That is correct, Your 

Honor. And just to add one additional point on

 to the table, I mean, there's a lot of judicial

 resources expended just by these lawsuits.  I 

mean, when you have, you know, 200 lawsuits 

being filed in federal district courts, the 

judges are expending resources on that. They 

-- they -- individual judges may be deciding 

the standing question on their own without 

guidance from this Court. 

So it seems to me that if the goal is 

to save judicial resources, of course, as Your 

Honor said, this Court's resources might be 

saved if it just decides the question presented 

one way or another.  If we think of the entire 

federal judiciary, I think --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I wonder whether --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the -- suppose 

that there's a case that involves an issue that 

has divided the courts of appeals.  There is an 

entrenched split.  It would be helpful to 

provide guidance on this issue and not allow 

the split to persist.  But the case before us 

is dead as a doornail and is not going to arise

 Would you say there that for the 

prudential reasons that have been mentioned, it 

would be permissible for us to decide the

 issue?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I don't think the

 Court could decide the merits.  I think that

 under Article III, that's just flatly banned. 

But this case is different because the question 

presented is a question of Article III, so the 

Court has the jurisdiction to decide that 

jurisdictional question. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But --

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I disagree, Your 

Honor. I think that the judgment of this Court 

is going to be that there is no case or

 controversy.  That's not an advisory opinion.

 That's disposing of the case in front of the

 Court.

 And I think the Court is free to state

 the reasoning that we are advocating in this 

case as part -- in this case, excuse me, as 

part of its judgment that there isn't a case or 

controversy under Article III. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it still feels 

a bit unjudicial, if I may say, so that the 

question is not just resources but -- but 

something broader than that.  And I take the 

point that each of these is a jurisdictional 

issue and that there's nothing jurisdictionally 

precluding us, that this is a matter of 

prudence.  But, when you look at a case that's 

dead as a doornail several times over, you 

know, the -- the -- the case has been dismissed 

by the plaintiff.  The defendant is totally 

different.  The defendant's website, everybody 

agrees, is now in compliance with the ADA.

So this is, like, dead, dead, dead in 

all the ways that something can be dead. And 

to use that case as the vehicle for deciding an

 important issue, an issue that probably is 

going to need to be decided at some point but 

surely could come up in a live case, I -- I --

I -- I guess it just doesn't seem like

 something that a court should -- should be

 anxious to do. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, just to address 

some of the subsidiary issues Your Honor 

mentioned, the question of whether the updates 

to the website made the case dead is actually 

disputed among the parties.  The First Circuit 

held and Respondent continues to argue that 

that didn't moot the case.  So I think that 

that would be a difficult -- maybe not 

difficult, but the Court would have to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's not 

disputed that the hotel's website is in 

compliance. The only thing that's in dispute 

is what the issue is with respect to, like,

somebody else, the hotel is in compliance in 

terms of its own website, and, you know, most

importantly, the plaintiff has dropped this

 case.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Right.  So, in -- in 

terms of the sale of the hotel, so Acheson 

Hotels remains the defendant in this case. It 

would be the subject of any hypothetical

 injunction and fee award.  So we don't think 

that moots the case unless there's a court 

order substituting the new defendant, which 

never happened.  So I'm -- I'm not sure that's 

a reason not to decide the question presented. 

But, look, I --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, I think you're 

avoiding the main --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Okay.  I understand 

Your -- Your Honor's argument that if they've 

dropped the case, why are you deciding this big 

question.  And, yes, that is certainly a 

discretionary consideration that the Court 

should consider in deciding how to dispose of 

this case.  It is a weight on one side of the 

balance. 

And I just think that the weights are 

greater on the other side of the balance when 

you consider the institutional considerations

that should lead the Court to decide the 

question presented, such as a concern about 

blessing the legal strategy in this case of 

Respondent, which will be invoked in future 

cases by other litigants because the same thing 

is going to happen. A plaintiff is going to 

file a large number of lawsuits, and in the 

rare case that goes up, the plaintiff will 

abandon the case at the last minute, and if 

there's push-back from either the court or the 

defendant, the plaintiff is going to say look 

at what happened in the Acheson case; the 

Supreme Court said it was perfectly fine to 

adopt that legal strategy. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, if it's going 

to happen again, why don't we wait until it 

happens again, and then we have the pattern 

you're talking about?  What you're saying is 

resolve it now because you can foresee that 

that will occur, and I guess I just don't

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- because we should

 just wait until it comes up again.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think what's 

going to happen, Justice Jackson, is that, you

 know, in the court of appeals, a plaintiff will 

drop the case, and then the plaintiff will cite

 this Court's decision in this case to say

 that's fine, and then the court of appeals will

 follow this Court's precedent in this case and 

allow the plaintiff to drop the case. 

And then I guess, theoretically, a 

petition for certiorari could be filed, but 

it's not clear that the -- the defendant has --

has standing to even file that petition for 

certiorari when the defendant actually won in 

the court of appeals.  And so it's actually not 

clear to me this question will come back if 

future claims follow this -- this template. 

And, again, in the Court -- in Your 

Honors' -- in this case, the Court's going to 

write an opinion.  Even if it resolves this

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, concrete

 travel.  I'm talking about an allegation in a

 complaint, just I -- I -- I -- I may someday

 visit this hotel.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I don't think "I may 

someday" is enough. That kind of sounds like

 the allegations --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  "I will someday." 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  "I will" -- I think "I 

will" -- "someday" probably is not enough 

either. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  "Someday" not good 

enough? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I don't think -- under 

Lujan case, the Court held that "someday" plans 

aren't good enough for standing. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In the next decade? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think it's got to be 

concrete plans.  If you're -- if you're going 

to Wells next summer and you're trying to make 

a reservation at Coast Village, I think that's 

enough for standing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  With --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the way people

 travel, counselor.  When people travel, or at 

least when I do, and I think I'm not abnormal 

in this sense, I look at a place, I look at 

various sites to decide where I want to stay, I 

look at price points, I look at the level of

 accessibility, whatever.  All right?

 So what you're saying is that there's 

no stigmatic harm to a disabled person in their 

ability to do what I do, look at a place and 

say: I may want to visit Venice, I may want to 

visit Florida, I may want to visit California, 

and I want information about all the sites 

there so I can decide what suits me best. 

And you're saying you need something 

much more concrete than that? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I've been deprived 

of my ability to make an informed choice about 

where to visit and I'm not harmed 

stigmatically? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, so it seems to

checking a few hotels and is trying to decide

where to stay, but the person's planning to 

travel, then I think that there would be 

standing. Like, if you're saying I want to go

 to Ocean City and I'm looking at two or three 

hotels, not sure which one to stay at --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the person who 

says, I want to find the place to visit --

Ocean City, Atlantic City, whatever other city 

-- and now I'm doing my investigation of all 

three cities and I decide against your city 

because I couldn't find enough accessible 

places, I'm not harmed? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, I -- I don't -- I 

don't think so.  I mean, I don't think that if 

you have no idea where you're going to go and 

you're just going to a hotel website for some 

randomly picked hotel in a city and see it's 

not accessible, but you don't have any --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why aren't I 

-- I don't understand. Discrimination, I 

thought, meant that I'm being treated 

differently than other people. If I go on a 

drive to a place and there's a sign up that 

says "No disabled person is welcome," I've been 

discriminated against, correct?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's different 

than my going to a website and the website 

saying nothing about disability, so I know I'm

 not welcome there?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, Your Honor, if 

you see the sign that says "No disabled people

 welcome," I actually don't think that there's 

standing unless you want to enter the business. 

So, if you -- if you're on the internet and you 

see a sign of some business and --

oh, so in -- the -- the people who used to go 

to lunch counters and wanted to just sit down, 

they didn't necessarily want to try the food 

there --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, no. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- those people 

weren't discriminated against? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  They were definitely 

discriminated against because they were 

prevented from sitting at the lunch counter. 

That's the discrimination.

 If -- how many hotels did Ms. Laufer

MR. UNIKOWSKY: Depending on how you 

count, because sometimes lawsuits can count as 

two or one, it's definitely more than 500 and 

perhaps more than 600.

alleges that she may well go to this particular 

hotel, you would be able to challenge the 

veracity of that allegation, right? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.

we've distinguished the scenario where someone

barrier, the person couldn't enter.  And that's 

because we understand the inability to access a 

building as a traditional Article III injury

website at all because there aren't the --

 there's not the appropriate technology for the

 visually impaired to make use of the website.

 Would you say also that that's sort of 

like the person who wants to enter a building?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That, you know -- and 

the visually impaired person is, in fact, a 

tester and is just checking out different 

websites? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So we -- we actually 

haven't taken that position.  There's --

there's three courts of appeals decisions, one 

of which -- one of which was written by then 

Judge Barrett, involving visually impaired 

testers who go to websites of credit unions 

that they weren't even statutorily eligible to 

join, and those courts held that the plaintiffs 

did not have standing, and we actually think 

those are correctly decided. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, I -- I 

understand that.  But, if a -- if a person 

is -- is, you know, just, you know, checking 

out websites in the way that, you know, not --

it's not like I'm eligible to join the website 

of a particular company, but just in the way we

 all check out websites and can't do that, 

whether the fact that he was a tester could 

prevent the person from making a claim.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I don't think the 

person has standing, but, even if you disagree, 

our case is different from that. So the first 

part of my answer is I don't think so. I think 

that, as in the case with the credit unions, 

merely trying to seek information about a 

service you don't want, I don't think that's an 

Article III injury under TransUnion's 

discussion of informational harm. 

But the second part of my answer is 

that even if you think I'm completely wrong on 

that, I think that's distinguishable because, 

in that case, the plaintiff was prevented from 

using the website. 

In this case, we think what really 

happened here was that there was a bar to 

accessing the hotel, which doesn't become 

relevant until the plaintiff tries to do that.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I have a question

 about some of Justice Sotomayor and Justice 

Kagan's hypotheticals. I mean, it does seem

 like they're all meaningfully different in the

 injury sense, and I'm wondering whether -- I

 mean, I'm -- I'm thinking about a plaintiff who 

tries to make a reservation at Acheson Hotel 

and then just gets frustrated because she's 

disabled and she can't get the information, so 

she says, I'm not giving this place my 

business, but I want to sue.  Like, I would 

never go say -- stay there because -- and I'm 

not going to go back to the website because I'm 

offended.  You know, this isn't -- this isn't a 

place that I want to frequent. 

Do you think that person suffered an 

Article III injury? 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes, but they couldn't 

sue because you can only get an injunction.

that's my question.  You're not taking the

 position that my plaintiff hasn't suffered an 

Article III injury, but you're saying here that

 the forward-looking piece of it is because you 

have to show that you have standing for the

 relief that you seek, and the ADA only permits

 an injunction?

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Correct.  The injury

 has to be in the future.  Correct. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Thanks. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Jackson? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I'm 

trying to figure out the difference between 

your argument in saying that you want to 

preserve tester standing, that testers you 

understand are okay and Ms. Laufer is not. And 

I know that you say that she is a 

self-appointed tester. 

Is that because -- you're trying to 

distinguish her from the testers that you think 

have standing and don't?  And what's the 

difference?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I see.  I see.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  But I -- other testers

standing. It depends on the particular facts. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess I'm trying

there -- whether what's really hard here is 

drawing the distinction between a tester who 

actually experiences discrimination even if 

they don't really want the service 

subjectively, right? 

So this is -- Justice Sotomayor talked 

about the people going to lunch counters.  They 

aren't hungry.  They're not actually there for 

the sandwich.  They're going in because they 

are putting themselves into a discriminatory 

situation in order to be able to challenge the 

policy.

inflict in certain circumstances an Article III 

stigmatic injury.  We just don't think that

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I think there's --

there's several differences between this case

 and the lunch counter hypothetical.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Hmm. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So, first of all, I

 think this is more of a generalized grievance 

like in the lunch counter or Ms. Coleman in

 Havens Realty.  Like, the person was personally 

the victim of racial discrimination. 

I think that when you just go to a 

website to check ADA compliance, that's more of 

a generalized grievance. 

There's also no intent to discriminate 

in this case.  I do realize that the ADA 

considers the disparate effect of facially 

neutral policies to be discriminatory just as 

disparate treatment is discriminatory. 

But, in this case, there's no 

disparate effect either because she's not using 

the information.  So there's no -- the 

disrespect of intentional discrimination --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's all --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  -- is absent too.

 assessment of whether or not this building

 offers services that they can use?

 MR UNIKOWSKY: Yeah, but --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what she's trying 

-- the reason why there's discrimination is

 because an able-bodied person can get on the 

website and it shows that there are 15 rooms 

available at this hotel, and so they know that

 there are 15 rooms available and they could go 

there, whereas a disabled person, unless the 

hotel identifies that it actually has 

accessible rooms, can't look on the website and 

assess the availability of those rooms.  I 

thought that was the discriminatory issue. 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yeah, but the problem 

is that looking at the website is not an end in 

itself.  I think it's a means to the end of 

accessing the hotel.  Like the reason you want 

to know whether there's a wheelchair ramp is to 

know if you show up at the hotel whether you 

can enter it. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Maybe.  I mean, 

there could be a lot of reasons, right?  I 

mean, the point is you're being discriminated 

against because you can't -- you don't have the

 the hotel and whether rooms are available.

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I guess I just don't

 view -- I mean, there's no argument that 

Respondent couldn't use the website, unlike in

 the hypothetical with the visually impaired

 plaintiff that Justice Kagan asked about.  I

 think that her ability to use the website was

 not constrained.  She just didn't get 

information that she needed to know whether she 

could access the building, which I just don't 

think is an injury, unless you're going to use 

that information somehow.

 about whether the case was moot.

 Now, as I take my friend to agree, 

it's clearly moot. We have not only a

 plaintiff who no longer seeks to litigate her 

claims, a defendant who no longer owns the 

hotel, but also a website that is no longer 

lacking the relevant information.

 Rather than decide the more difficult

 standing question in this highly artificial 

posture, the Court should exercise its 

discretion to vacate the First Circuit's 

decision and dismiss the case as moot under 

Munsingwear. 

At a minimum, if the Court exercises 

its discretion to address standing, it should 

hold that Respondent lacks standing for a 

narrow reason.  Her claim to standing depends 

on her view that Title III and the Reservation 

Rule give her a freestanding right to 

information, akin to the right to information 

about housing in Havens. 

But the ADA and the Reservation Rule 

are narrower.  They give individuals with 

disabilities a right to information in 

connection with the equal enjoyment of a

Ms. Laufer has not alleged that she would use 

that service in the future, she lacks standing.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  You're not saying 

that we don't have jurisdiction over the case 

-- as I understand you.  You're simply saying 

that we should exercise our discretion not to 

decide the standing issue? 

MS. ROSS: That's correct, Justice 

Thomas.  When the government was on the 

receiving end of this type of a dismissal of a 

complaint in district court after the grant --

Court had granted certiorari in Carnahan, we 

specifically laid out our -- our thoughts on 

this issue, specifically, that the Court does 

have discretion to decide either the standing 

or the mootness question first, but, there, we 

said, you know, it makes sense, given the 

artificial nature of the case once the 

plaintiff has dismissed her claims, to decide 

mootness while leaving on the table, you know, 

the possibility that in a future case you might 

choose to decide standing.

because it's not just sort of artificial in the 

way that any case in which a plaintiff who has

 dismissed her claims will be artificial.  It's 

-- it's sort of extra-artificial for the 

reasons that Justice Kagan was -- was pointing

 out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you're 

confident that the mootness question is easy. 

Is the government at all concerned about the 

manipulation of this Court's jurisdiction when 

you have -- because Ms. -- Ms. Laufer, I 

gather, is not the only person doing this, 

bringing hundreds of cases around the country, 

and then, when the Court gets interested in her 

case, it's all gone.  It's moot. 

It doesn't stop any of the other 

dozens of people, however many there are, who 

are doing the same thing.  So we may have to 

come up with another case as soon as this --

this one, if it's -- if it's not addressed, and 

then they will -- that one will be mooted. 

And, you know, we can't sort of keep 

granting cert and having it constantly being 

mooted with never a determination of whether

there's standing in those variety of cases.

 I mean, you may think that that's not 

necessarily easier or harder than the standing

 question, but it's -- It's certainly not one 

that we can just, you know, toss off with the 

back of our hand, is it?

 MS. ROSS: So I certainly understand 

the institutional concern, and that is why,

 among other reasons, we think the -- the Court 

can and should leave on the table this option 

of actually deciding the standing question 

rather than the mootness question in a future 

case should this actually become a pattern.  I 

just think, again, that this is a particularly 

poor case to do it in. 

And I think, beyond that, you know, on 

-- on the more specific question of whether 

this case will -- or a case like this will come 

to the Court again, I think this has already 

been covered, but the circuit split actually 

looks quite different now than it did when the 

Court granted certiorari.  It's not just that 

the parties agree that under Munsingwear the 

First Circuit decision would have to be vacated 

in this case, but it's also that the Eleventh

now there's only one circuit decision on

 Petitioner's side -- excuse me, Respondent's 

side of the split.

 And so I think parties may -- may

 adjust their behavior in -- in light of this, 

but, again, we, for the institutional reasons 

you note, think the Court can reserve this

 option in future cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How -- reserve 

the option.  How many times does this -- do we 

have to do this?  The next case that comes up 

in the same posture as this, should we let that 

one go too because maybe it'll be the last one, 

or should we address it here? 

MS. ROSS: So I certainly understand 

the concern, Mr. Chief Justice.  Again, you 

know, I think it's not just that this is the 

first case.  It's really that this is sort of 

moot to the third. I mean, it has a plaintiff 

who has dismissed her claims, a defendant who 

no longer owns the hotel in question, and a 

website that everyone agrees has been updated.

decision, the reason why the First Circuit

 third-party issue with respect to hotels.com

 and other third-party websites.  But, under the

 regulation, it's the hotel owner whose job it

 is to inform those third parties about 

accessibility information, and we don't even

 have that party before the Court to tell us --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think --

MS. ROSS: -- whether that has 

happened. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- I think the --

I think the Chief's question was, next time, we 

shouldn't do this, do you agree? 

MS. ROSS: You know, I think certainly 

I would have to know more about what it looks 

like next time, but I think the whole point, 

obviously, of the Court reserving this ability 

would be -- or recognizing this ability, 

really, because they're both jurisdictional 

questions, would be to allow you to say yes, 

we're going to go to standing in the next case. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Do you think it's 

relevant that the reason the split looks 

different too is also perhaps strategic 

behavior on the part of the Respondent?

Because didn't she go to those other circuits 

and then dismiss her claims and ask for the

 decisions to be vacated? 

MS. ROSS: So, you know, I -- I don't

 want to sort of import -- or impart a motive to 

any of the parties on -- on either side of this

 case. I think the Eleventh Circuit decision is

 actually a little bit more complicated than 

that because it was actually that the defendant 

not only -- or had not just sold the hotel at 

the time of the decision, it actually had 

dissolved and had not told the court that at 

the time, and so it wasn't sort of just on 

Ms. Laufer's side of the v. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  It was at her 

request, is all I'm saying. 

MS. ROSS: Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah. 

MS. ROSS: I think it was at her 

request.  You know, again, I -- I think the 

question really is, given how much more 

difficult at least we think the standing 

question is than the mootness question, whether 

it makes sense in this case, where we have 

these additional complications, to go ahead and

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm wondering, just to 

turn to the standing question --

MS. ROSS: Certainly.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- how you would 

distinguish your position from Mr. Unikowsky's

 views and why it matters.

 MS. ROSS: Sure. So I -- I think 

there are sort of many differences, but I guess 

I'll hit three main ones. 

The first one is that Mr. Unikowsky, 

in his brief and then again this morning, 

expressed the view that the Reservation Rule is 

really about access to the facility under the 

ADA. 

We -- we understand it a little bit 

differently.  There's, of course, some element 

of access to the facility in there, but the 

statute says --

JUSTICE KAGAN: When you say "the 

facility," meaning the hotel? 

MS. ROSS: The hotel, the physical 

place of public accommodation.  The -- the 

statute also guarantees people with 

disabilities the equal enjoyment of the

 services of a place of public accommodation, 

and so I think how this cashes out is that in 

-- on Mr. Unikowsky's view, I think, if you 

have a hotel like this one that has no

 accessible -- no accessible rooms, then a

 plaintiff can never have standing based on the

 fact that they didn't tell you that on their 

website because you couldn't go there anyway.

 We think that actually is an injury. 

If -- if you're trying to figure it out and you 

can't because they don't have the information, 

you're not having the equal enjoyment of the 

service in the way that the ADA provides. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is your argument 

really a standing argument, an Article III 

argument, or is it a merits argument?  You're 

saying that when Title III and the Reservation 

Rule are properly interpreted, then Ms. Laufer 

doesn't have a claim.  That's a merits 

argument. 

MS. ROSS: So, Justice Alito, I 

appreciate that the -- the analyses sort of 

overlap in this area, and I think the reason 

why that is so is that this Court has 

specifically recognized that congressional --

what Congress does in terms of creating rights 

and causes of action is relevant.

 I think the -- the phrase this Court 

used in TransUnion was, you know, due respect,

 obviously Havens, other cases.  And so I do

 think there's some overlap.  But we do think 

the way this comes to the Court is that 

discrimination is an Article III injury when 

somebody personally experiences it with respect 

to her rights.  And --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let -- let me

transporting my champion Saint Bernard and I 

want to check in to a hotel with my dog, and 

they ask me:  Is it a service dog?  I say no, 

it's not a service dog. Is it an emotional 

support dog?  No, it's not an emotional support 

dog. Well, they say, you can't check into the 

hotel because either we don't allow dogs at all

 hundred pounds.  And I say, well, you're

 violating the ADA.  And I sue under the ADA.

 Now do I lack standing? Have I not 

suffered an injury in fact because I can't get 

this hotel room and I can't have my dog, my 

champion Saint Bernard, with me in my room? Or 

do I just lose because the dog isn't covered --

having the dog with -- without it being a 

service dog or an emotional support dog is not 

covered by the ADA? 

MS. ROSS: So I think you might just 

have a merits problem there if I'm following it 

correctly, but I think it's a little bit 

different because the -- the harm that you're 

alleging in that case is the -- just the -- the 

harm from -- you know, maybe the person was 

mean to you, you just really wanted to bring 

your dog, whatever it is. 

I think the way that this case is 

pitched is that the right that -- that 

Ms. Laufer claims gives her standing is the 

violation of the statutory right to information 

or the -- the violation of the regulation.  And 

so we sort of have to know what the statute or 

the regulation provide to decide whether she

away does not have standing.  Neither of them

many websites I can find information in.  Is

 that what her problem was, that she didn't try

 to make a reservation --

MS. ROSS: So I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- or that she

 didn't look at the reservation?  I -- I don't 

understand. When do we get to that point?

 MS. ROSS: Sure. So I think when we 

get to the point where she has an injury is 

when she says, just as the physical tester 

says, I would go inside, when she says, I would 

make a reservation or I would use this 

information to consider making a reservation, 

because, you know, we certainly take the points 

that were expressed earlier about people who 

are -- are considering whether they're going to 

go to the place and are trying to figure it 

out. 

But I think the difference here is 

that Ms. Laufer was doing this, she -- she had 

no use for the reservation service itself.  She 

had no interest in actually even completing 

that transaction. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I find this 

so hard because I think what we're trying to do

than the physical entry or attempted entry, 

because we agree in Blue Haven that the couple 

wasn't intending to rent, they just went and

 asked for information and -- not Blue Haven, 

I'm sorry, Haven Realty, and they got turned 

away, and you're saying that we shouldn't write 

this to overturn Haven Realty.

 MS. ROSS: Certainly not, Justice 

Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So 

what's different than my going to -- the black 

couple went to the door of the place, asked for 

information.  A disabled person goes to a 

website, which is, in my mind, the door to the 

hotel or at least a telephone to the hotel, and 

is being told, no, you're not welcomed here 

because we're not -- we don't have accessible 

rooms here? 

MS. ROSS: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Basically, it --

it's almost a negative, which is, if you don't 

give me the information, you're telling me that 

it's not accessible to me.

of what you've said, Justice Sotomayor.  I

 think the distinction comes between the way 

that the statute at issue in Havens was 

written, which was it is unlawful to falsely

 tell any person that there is no housing

 available for a discriminatory reason,

 essentially, whereas the -- the reservation --

and so it doesn't matter whether you're going

 to -- to rent the apartment, it does not matter 

at all. 

I think, here, the Reservation Rule is 

much narrower than that.  It does provide a 

right to information but in connection with 

actually making a reservation.  So, if you go 

to pages 9A to 10A of our statutory appendix, 

where the regulation is laid out in full, the 

title of it is "Reservations made by places of 

lodging."  The requirements apply with respect 

to reservations made by any means, and all the 

way through to, you know, the exceptions and 

the effective date are based on reservations. 

And so I think it's not this sort of anybody in 

the world gets information in quite the same 

way that it was in Havens. 

But, again, completely agree that

But I also want to ask whether the 

first difference that you mentioned, which is 

you're focusing on the reservation service and 

he's focusing on the hotel or other facility, 

might introduce a kind of gamesmanship with 

respect to tester plaintiffs, you know, that 

you go into the website and you make the 

reservation and two days later you cancel the 

reservation, and you said:  Hey, I made a 

reservation, what's your problem?  Of course, I 

have standing.

in order.  I think, to finish the list -- and I

the papers and today that there might be sort 

of a particularization problem simply because 

this is on the website.

 We disagree with that.  I mean, I

 think, if an individual experiences the 

discrimination on a website because they are

 actually trying to make a reservation, as this

 Court has said in other contexts, the fact that

 a -- an injury is widely shared does not mean 

that it's not particularized. 

And then the third point was, again, 

about this question about, you know, what 

counts as discrimination.  I think -- I -- I --

more so in the brief, and so I -- I don't want 

to attribute too much of a difference here, but 

I think in -- we think it's very clear that 

Congress defined discrimination to include the 

failure to make reasonable modifications. 

And so the fact that, you know, 

someone can say:  Well, my website has, you 

know, the same information for all comers and 

she wasn't sort of personally picked out to 

have different information, I think is no 

answer to the idea that this is real 

discrimination under the ADA.

And I think this -- that's a concept 

that this Court has recognized in other areas. 

So, for example, in the religion context, 

obviously, in cases like Abercrombie, the Court 

has made clear that, you know, it's not enough 

to just have a neutral "no head covering" 

policy.  You need to make an accommodation to

 treat people equally.

 To the gamesmanship point, I think 

that our test for standing will be narrower 

than the one that the court of appeals adopted. 

I think there will be fewer testers. 

I don't think there will be no 

testers, and I think that's just a -- a 

consequence of the fact that this statute does 

provide a -- a right to anyone who's trying to 

use the service, and we don't take a step back 

and look to their motive. 

But I do think, to some of the 

questions that came earlier, the -- the lower 

courts will have ways to ferret some of that 

gamesmanship out.  For example, you know, if 

you say, I would have made a reservation on 

this website, but it turns out that when you 

see compliant websites you never make a

reservation, then a court might say that's not

 a credible allegation.

 Similarly, I think hotels will have an 

ability to change how difficult it is to make a

 reservation and then cancel it.  And so it

 might not be credible to say, I would have made 

a reservation if, in fact, I would have had to 

put down my deposit upfront and I couldn't get 

it back if I canceled it later.

 What if I am not disabled and I don't

care a lot about the issue, to only stay at 

hotels that do post the information on websites 

and also make accommodations? 

So I go to the website and I try to 

make a reservation, and I could make a 

reservation at a room, you know, that's not 

handicapped-accessible. 

But would I have standing then because 

the website -- and -- and, in fact, I do make 

the reservation, but would I have standing 

then? I used the service.  I guess I'm just 

trying to figure out, so you're saying that 

it's plaintiffs who intend to use the service 

who would have standing. 

And I'm trying to -- to narrow down, 

does that just mean anyone who would use the 

service, or does that just mean the subset of

need to be suffering discrimination within the 

meaning of the ADA, and so the person who 

doesn't need the accessibility information, I 

think, would not have standing. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So it's tied in. 

It's not just -- and I -- I honestly think some 

of the confusion in these cases is just by 

using "informational injury" with no additional 

explanation. 

It's -- it's not just kind of a bald 

informational injury.  It's informational 

injury because -- and you're saying it's tied 

here to discrimination -- because she lacked 

information, she was discriminated against 

because she couldn't access the service, the 

reservation service online? 

MS. ROSS: Exactly. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So my thought has 

been that we need to distinguish between the

documentarian, a passionate observer, a person 

who's going there just to see, are you 

following the rules, Hotel X, Hotel B, et 

cetera, and a person who, I think you're 

saying, is trying to use the service. 

Is that a -- the -- the relevant line 

in terms of establishing injury? 

MS. ROSS: Yes, Justice Jackson.

make a reservation, or could I be looking at 

this because there's a possibility that I might 

want to, you know, go to this area in the way 

some of the hypotheticals have talked about,

 and I want to see could I go there?  Is that

 enough?

 MS. ROSS: So I think that probably is

 enough.  I mean, I think, you know, this gets 

complicated because we're talking about both 

what's enough under the Reservation Rule but 

also what's enough for forward-looking relief. 

And so I think you sort of have to tease those 

things out.  But it seems like, if you are, you 

know, comparison-shopping because you want to 

go either -- you're thinking about three 

different hotels or three different cities and 

you're trying to figure out, you know, is this 

a place that I could make a reservation, then I 

do think that you would have standing under our 

conception of the -- the rule. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  And that 

seems like it's a little bit different than

 imminent plans or something like that, right?

 MS. ROSS: I think that's right.  And,

 you know, I -- again, as I said earlier, I

 think this cash -- one of the ways this cashes

 out is the -- when the hotel actually has no

 accessibility information, the person --

discriminated against because they can't use 

the service in the same way that somebody else 

can.

bucket because she disclaims any interest in 

actually possibly going to this hotel?

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Or in Maine or 

whatever? 

MS. ROSS: So -- so I think it's the 

disclaiming or the -- the failure to allege 

that she would make a reservation, because we 

are focused on the service, not sort of the 

downstream question of whether she ultimately 

would keep the reservation.

And I think the -- part of the reason 

for that is that, you know, when I'm travel 

planning, when other people who don't have 

disabilities are travel planning, I have an 

ability to look at different websites, even if 

I'm ultimately not going to go to that place.

 And so I think part of the

 discrimination here is -- is being treated 

differently with respect to that ability to --

to gather the information necessary to make the

 services and engaging in unlawful 

discrimination under the ADA.

 As Congress recognized, when places of 

public accommodation fail to take reasonable 

steps to make their services available to 

people with disabilities, they signal that

 disabled people are unwelcome participants in 

the marketplace and contribute to their

 day-to-day experience of being isolated, 

invisible, and ignored. 

If the Court reaches the standing 

question presented by Acheson, it should reject 

Acheson's argument that a disabled person does 

not experience that dignitary harm when she 

encounters the accessibility barrier on 

Acheson's website, unless she also has travel 

plans that are thwarted by the discriminatory 

treatment. 

For over six decades and most notably 

in Havens Realty, this Court has recognized 

that discrimination inflicts Article III injury 

regardless of whether the plaintiff experiences 

any harm beyond the unequal treatment. 

What it means to personally experience 

discrimination on the internet is a novel

 question, but whether the answer is the one

 we've offered or the one the government

 proposes, Havens requires a test that focuses 

on what the plaintiff experiences on the 

website, not her underlying motive in that

 experience or whether any downstream injuries

 result.

 Finally, I want to return to the issue

 the Court started with today.  Mr. Unikowsky 

and I are both arguing before the Court on 

behalf of clients that have no legal interest 

in the outcome of this case:  Ms. Laufer 

because she has dismissed her complaint with 

prejudice and will not be bringing any more ADA 

suits and Acheson because it no longer owns the 

hotel whose reservations service the suit 

challenged. 

These circumstances render the case, 

at minimum, a poor vehicle for reaching the 

standing question. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  You started with the 

standing question, and you spoke of dignitary 

injury, and in your briefs, I think you focus 

on stigmatic injury.  The government seems to

 to be a -- a -- a difference in your 

characterization of the injury here.

 Would you spend a few minutes and 

explain which injury are we talking about?

 MS. CORKRAN: Here, we're talking

 about a discriminatory denial of information,

 so it's not a pure informational injury.  The 

discrimination aspect of it is important 

because, as in Havens, it's not just that 

you're not getting the information; you're not 

getting the information for a reason that 

conveys that you have inferior status in 

society.  So it's inflicting a dignitary harm 

that you wouldn't have from a purely 

informational injury. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: I guess I could think 

of cases in which a denial of injury doesn't go 

to one's dignity or to -- doesn't create this 

sort of a stigmatic --

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Deprivation. 

And it -- but it seems as though the 

government doesn't make that second step to the 

injury that you're talking about.  It simply --

it's talk -- it focuses more on the information 

that you are deprived of in order to be able to 

use or to make a decision about using a hotel.

 MS. CORKRAN: I -- I -- I think the 

government's brief does talk about this Court's

 jurisprudence on dignitary harm and 

discrimination and the fact that the Court has

 never required any downstream consequence for a 

-- a discriminatory injury. 

And that's certainly the approach the 

Eleventh Circuit took on this issue. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I agree with you 

that discriminatory treatment is itself an 

injury under our precedents and Article III, 

certainly in Havens Realty. 

The discriminatory treatment here, I 

think Mr. Unikowsky is saying, would have 

occurred at the hotel or in and that there was 

no discrimination in the information provided 

because everyone was provided the same 

information.  I just want to give you an 

opportunity to respond to that. 

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah, thank you, Your

 accommodation cannot discriminate in the

 provision of services.  So it's not just in

 access to their building.  The service itself 

has to be provided in a way that allows people 

with disabilities to use it in the same way as

 non-disabled people.

 I also think this argument, when it's 

framed that way, really is a merits question

 and, under Steel Co., isn't part of the 

standing inquiry.  I think, under Steel Co. and 

Lexmark and if you combine those with 

TransUnion and Spokeo, the Court assumes as 

valid Ms. Laufer's cause of action here, so you 

assume that the allegations in her complaint 

state a claim of unlawful discrimination under 

12182, and then you also assume that Congress 

conferred a cause of action to her. 

And then the question is, did Congress 

act within its constitutional authority when it 

provided a cause of action here? 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, I think the 

-- Mr. Unikowsky's saying, particularly in the 

briefs, this is an Allen versus Wright kind of 

case, not a Havens Realty kind of case. And

Allen versus Wright, as you know, someone in

 Hawaii can't complain about discrimination

 that's occurring in Maine.  Havens Realty, you 

actually personally experienced the 

discrimination yourself when you're, as Judge

 Barrett, then-Judge Barrett said in Casillas, 

when you're lied to because of your race.

 So why isn't this case more like what

 Allen versus Wright described there? 

MS. CORKRAN: The -- the plaintiffs in 

Allen v. Wright were challenging the IRS's 

failure to enforce a provision of the Internal 

Revenue Code that required it -- it to withhold 

tax-exempt status from discriminatory schools. 

The plaintiffs in that case had no private 

right to the IRS complying with the law.  They 

were seeking to enforce a public right.  And in 

those circumstances, they had to show that they 

were personally injured by the IRS's 

non-compliance. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I wonder whether 

there isn't a broader principle at stake in a 

case called -- like Havens.  I mean, here, your 

client has disclaimed, has said, I'm not

 MS. CORKRAN: The reason the case 

comes to the Court in -- in that posture is 

because injunctive relief is so elusive when 

you're talking about concrete travel plans.  As 

was noted earlier, Ms. Laufer did amend her 

complaint in this case to say that she was 

going on this long road trip, but when the case 

was on appeal, she had already gone on the road 

trip. 

And so that's why, when we say she's 

disclaimed any intent of going on a trip, it's 

because, by the time the case was on appeal, 

she had already gone on the trip --

 just a denial of information.  The day-to-day 

experience of being a disabled person is to --

to have your world be very small because our --

our marketplace, our places of public -- public 

accommodation, just ignore you. They don't see 

you. They don't recognize you as a potential 

customer or as a member of the marketplace. 

And so, when -- when Ms. Laufer goes 

to the website and she sees that she's 

invisible, that they are not even acknowledging 

her --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose she goes

 Solicitor General's test.  Am I missing

 something?

 MS. CORKRAN:  I -- I see the intuitive

 appeal of the government's test. I think the

 government -- and -- and we are both asking

 this question of, how do you encounter 

discrimination on a website?  And -- and this 

goes to the analogy Justice Sotomayor was 

making. 

Our position is, well, in the physical 

barrier context, you experience, you encounter 

that accessibility barrier when you visit the 

hotel regardless of whether you want to stay at 

the hotel or what your underlying motive is. 

So, when we translate that into the internet 

context, we say you encounter the accessibility 

barrier when you go to the website and click 

around.  I think --

-- so maybe that's the difference.  Just -- I 

just want to make sure I understand what the

so just to articulate what I think the

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.

 MS. CORKRAN: -- the government says 

you have to use --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Not my hypothetical.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yeah.  The government

 says you have to use the website in some way. 

So they would, I think, say our position is 

akin to driving by the website, and they want 

you to engage with it and actually make a 

reservation or -- or engage with it in a way 

that shows you're considering making a 

reservation. 

We say in our brief, I'm not sure that 

distinction holds as a practical matter. Judge 

Newsom made this point as well. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, I'm not sure 

that it's going to be much of a pleading 

barrier if you were to adopt --

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- if there is any 

or whether you're comfortable with the

 government's position.

 MS. CORKRAN: I'm comfortable with the

 government's position so long as it's

 understood as an inquiry into what you

 experience on the website and not your 

underlying motive for being on the website --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right.  We put that 

aside. 

MS. CORKRAN: -- and not whether you 

experience any downstream injury as a result of 

being on the website. 

And I think that's the real problem 

with Acheson's position.  They are attempting 

to upend, I think, how this Court has always 

defined discriminatory injury, which is the 

injury is in the dignitary harm. You don't 

have to show some sort of downstream 

consequence, like --

I'm wondering, and this, I think, is Mr. 

Unikowsky's argument, and you've said it 

several times, that it's the discrimination you 

experience when you go to the website, when you 

-- there's the encounter on the website. 

And I think that distinguishes it from 

Havens, where the discrimination was right 

there. And what I understand Mr. Unikowsky and 

I think perhaps the government says, you can't 

add on, as if it made no difference, later 

discrimination on the website because she 

really doesn't need the information on the 

website, she's not going to use it. 

And so, to me, that's a key

 MS. CORKRAN: Well, in Havens, 

Ms. Coleman didn't need the information either.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, I

 mean, the -- the actual discrimination was

 against her.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right? And 

that -- that's all you needed. It was the 

information that was given there at her 

request.  That's the end of the case. 

Here, there's more.  It -- it -- it --

it is, as you say, discrimination on the 

website.  We don't have that when she just goes 

in, calls the -- the hotel.  She's not on the 

website.  And it seems to me that that takes it 

out of the initial -- initial encounter. 

MS. CORKRAN: Yeah.  I think the 

question then becomes, how do you -- how do you 

translate that Havens in-person encounter to 

the digital realm?  And I think, if you -- you 

know, if there had been a sign on the door at 

the realtor that said "If you're black, we have 

no apartments available," we wouldn't say that

 she's not on the website.  She's talking to the

 person in the -- in the hotel, right?

 MS. CORKRAN: Well, right.  So -- so,

 under the -- the hypothetical I just gave with 

Ms. Coleman, she isn't actually talking to 

anyone.  She's being told by a sign that there 

are no apartments available to her. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. And 

I'm challenging the hypothetical. 

MS. CORKRAN: Okay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because I 

think the hypothetical would say not the sign, 

the sign is the website, and she's going there. 

But she's not going to go there because she 

doesn't want the information from the website. 

She just needs to know from the conversation 

that it's not there.

 In both scenarios, Ms. Coleman had no

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- Ms. Corkran, can 

I give you another hypothetical that I hope 

will clarify things a little bit? 

So suppose we have an African American 

lawyer.  This is back in the '60s, segregation 

time, '50s, '60s, who is across the street from 

a restaurant, and they see, they know, that the 

restaurant is not serving black customers 

through the front window, and at this time, the 

law says you're supposed to be, and they're 

not. They're making these people go around the 

back. And he's obviously upset about this.  He 

feels the dignitary harm of seeing this happen. 

But he somehow disclaims that he ever would

 food. I mean, she sees the barrier.  I think 

this is where the breakdown is, I think, right?

 She's not like a tester who actually

 went to the counter.  They didn't really want

 the food.  They were only doing it to

 challenge.  Motive is irrelevant.  You -- we 

all agree that that person would have standing

 because they actually went there and they 

experienced the discrimination. 

I want to know why she isn't the 

lawyer looking out the window across the street 

seeing this happen.  And how can you say that 

he's confronting the barrier? 

MS. CORKRAN: Because she went to the 

website and she engaged with the website and 

she --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So he goes down, he 

goes out across the street, he's standing 

there. He -- he goes. He's not just looking 

from across the street.  He's literally right 

there at the counter because he wants to 

document this happening because he has in his 

mind: I really want to stop this, I'm going to 

sue.

MS. CORKRAN: Right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But he never goes to 

the counter to ask himself for the food.

 MS. CORKRAN: Yeah.  So I think -- I

 think Ms. Laufer is the -- is -- in her 

circumstance, when she goes to the website and 

she engages in the reservations service, she is 

encountering that accessibility barrier.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right. 

MS. CORKRAN: But I think the 

government's position -- if that doesn't -- if 

that doesn't resonate, the government's 

position, I think, works as well, again, and is 

compatible with Havens. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think some of 

the amicus briefs raise the concern that 

everyone throughout the United States can sue 

every inn and hotel throughout the United 

States and use the phrase -- I'm not saying I 

agree with this, but this is the phrase in the 

amicus brief -- "online version of offended 

observers." 

And so I want you to respond to that. 

Is that ultimately the effect of your position? 

Not saying that means your position's wrong,

but is that the effect of your position?

 MS. CORKRAN: No, it isn't, and I

 think this goes back to our discussion about

 Allen v. Wright.  Here, a disabled plaintiff is

 asserting a private right to equal treatment,

 and the -- the cause of action is for

 individuals who have experienced a violation of

 that private right.

 So, one, you can't -- you don't have a 

cause of action under Title III unless --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Put aside cause of 

action. 

MS. CORKRAN: Right. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  This is about 

standing. 

MS. CORKRAN: You don't -- you have to 

be both disabled so that you're actually 

experiencing a discriminatory denial of 

information and you have to have encountered 

the discrimination.

then could every disabled person throughout the 

United States sue every inn and hotel

 throughout the United States.  Again, not 

saying that means your position's wrong, but

 following up, I guess, on Justice Gorsuch, I'm 

trying to figure out where that leads.

 MS. CORKRAN: I -- I think any 

disabled person who goes to the website, 

whether they make a reservation under the 

government's rule, but they're engaging with it 

and confronting the accessibility barrier, 

would have experienced a violation of their 

private right under Title III, but that's not 

an -- that's not an extension of Article III 

standing.  That's just an application of 

traditional Article III principles to the 

digital realm. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think --

MS. CORKRAN: It's just everyone's 

reach has been expanded for better or worse. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  And I 

think the interesting difficult question in 

this case maybe on the standing side is, do you 

actually experience discrimination when you go 

to the website and you can get all the same

experiencing discrimination because what would

 happen if you went to the hotel?

 MS. CORKRAN: Well, so I don't think

 it's -- it's -- the discrimination is what

 would happen if you went to the hotel.  The

 discrimination is -- you know, we say in our 

brief it's as if you went up to a reservation 

desk in a wheelchair and the hotel had a 

practice of just ignoring anyone in a 

wheelchair or telling them to call a number. 

There is a dignity harm --

MS. CORKRAN: -- in being treated as 

invisible and not as a potential participant in 

the marketplace. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mm-hmm.  So

MS. CORKRAN: Would not have

MS. CORKRAN:  Oh, sorry.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- one other one. 

In the reply brief -- and I just want to make 

sure I have your answer on this. So U.S.

 v. Richardson's kind of a landmark standing 

case. In the reply brief, they say that U.S.

 v. Richardson would come out the other way 

under your theory if a plaintiff visited the

 CIA's website and observed that the information 

was absent. 

Do you want to respond to that? 

MS. CORKRAN: Yes.  So I think that's 

wrong for two reasons.  One, again, that's a 

public right case, and also it's a pure 

informational injury.  It doesn't involve a 

discriminatory denial of information. 

I was just going to return to the --

the mootness point and Your Honor's concerns 

about manipulating the Court's docket.  I don't 

think that this is one of those cases.  Of 

course, it is well established that the Court 

can exercise its discretion on what to do here 

on a case-by-case basis. 

Here, we don't have a respondent who 

waited to hear what the Court was going to do

 about granting review and then attempted to 

moot out the case. Ms. Laufer acquiesced to 

the Court's review, and then there was this 

unexpected development that was deeply

 upsetting to her.

 She hasn't brought any of these suits, 

I think, in close to two years and already

 wasn't planning on bringing any more.  The 

allegations against Mr. Gillespie were pretty 

devastating to her and she didn't want to 

pursue these cases anymore, and that's why we 

dismissed the complaint as moot. 

We were completely transparent with 

opposing counsel and the Court about the 

disciplinary order and about Ms. Laufer's 

reasoning, and we acknowledged in our 

suggestion of mootness that we were not 

manipulating the Court's jurisdiction, that 

it's free to reach the standing question if it 

thinks this case is still a good vehicle for 

doing so. 

And this is a highly unusual case in 

that not only does Ms. Laufer not have an

relied on Rule 25(c), I think, in their 

petition for the proposition that they're still

 the right defendant.

 But all that Rule 25(c) does is 

provide that if an injunction issues that it

 binds the new owners.  If anything, that makes 

it worse because the actual owners who are 

going to be bound by any injunction in this 

case aren't here, and we don't know what they 

think. 

But that injunction wouldn't apply to 

Acheson in any meaningful way.  They don't own 

the reservations site or the hotel.  And their 

only alleged interest in this case at this 

point is that Ms. Acheson now owns a different 

hotel. I think she takes the position that 

that hotel's reservations service is -- is in 

compliance, and -- and she might hypothetically 

get some lawsuit from someone else down the 

road. 

And I think this Court's cases, 

Camreta v. Greene and United States 

v. Juvenile, make clear that that sort of 

hypothetical future litigation isn't enough to 

avoid mootness.

the physical barriers to get to places. 

MS. CORKRAN: Right.

eligible to be a member.

 So that's an objective reason.  It 

didn't have to do with his subjective motive or

 any downstream consequences.  He just -- he --

he wasn't able to enjoy it anyway and therefore

 didn't experience the discriminatory injury

 under Title III.  So I don't think that what 

the Court does here necessarily impacts what's 

happening there. 

And then, I guess -- yeah, I -- I do 

think, if the Court adopts Acheson's position, 

that -- in order to allege a discriminatory 

injury under Title III, you have to allege some 

sort of downstream injury, would have an 

enormous consequence on the screen

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

 Justice.

 I'd just like to say a few words about 

the mootness issue and then a few words on the

 standing issue on which the Court granted

 certiorari. 

On the mootness issue, I just think 

that in deciding whether to exercise its 

discretion to decide the question presented, 

the Court should think about what's going to 

happen in the lower courts if it -- it doesn't 

do that. 

So, first of all, in the Fourth 

Circuit, where Ms. Laufer's lawsuit -- or the 

decision finding standing is binding precedent, 

it's essentially going to be impossible or 

almost impossible for a hotel to ever challenge 

standing because, in the district court, the 

hotel would have to lose a motion to dismiss, 

litigate the case all the way to judgment, 

lose, appeal, lose based on binding circuit 

precedent, and then file a petition for

rehearing en banc or a cert petition, and, of

 course, if that happens, then the hotel will 

abandon the case and cite this case for the

 proposition that it's allowed to do that.  So, 

essentially, plaintiffs within that circuit

 will be able to bring lawsuits forever.

 In other circuits, like the First and 

the Eleventh Circuit, okay, if the Court

 Munsingwear's this case, it's going to be 

persuasive rather than binding precedent, but, 

of course, persuasive authority may prove 

influential to the district courts. 

And even assuming that courts ignore 

it altogether, then you're going to have every 

single district court deciding this standing 

question in the first instance, which is going 

to lead to a lot of judicial resources being 

expended that would be saved if this case 

currently before the Court is decided. 

So I think that if the Court is 

concerned about expending judicial resources, 

they would ultimately be saved at the end of 

the day if the Court decides the question 

presented. 

On the merits, just one word.  I think

that Justice Kagan's question about a plaintiff

 who observes an accessibility barrier on a 

website is the right way to think about this

 case. I think the lack of information about 

accessibility is an accessibility barrier in 

the same way as an actual architectural barrier

 is an accessibility barrier.

 In both cases, the -- the plaintiff is 

deterred from going to the hotel. The lack of 

information deters the plaintiff from going to 

the physical building because the plaintiff 

doesn't know if they'll be able to get in, just 

as observing the accessibility barrier deters 

the plaintiff from going to the hotel because 

the plaintiff knows in that case that they 

can't get into the building. 

And so we think that those two cases 

should be understood the same way for purposes 

of standing. If going into the hotel is a 

requirement for the actual barrier, it should 

also be a requirement for lacking information 

about the barrier. 

So we're not seeking a far-reaching 

ruling abolishing tester standing or anything 

like that.  We certainly haven't asked the
