 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument next in Case 22-1178, the Federal 

Bureau of Investigation versus Yonas Fikre.

 Mr. Joshi. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SOPAN JOSHI

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSHI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Respondent's No Fly List claims are 

moot. He's not on the list.  He hasn't been on 

the list in eight years.  And he won't be put 

back on the list in the future based on the 

currently available information. That makes it 

absolutely clear that his return to the list for 

the same reasons he was put on it initially 

can't reasonably be expected to recur. 

Now the Ninth Circuit thought the 

claims weren't moot because the government 

hadn't acquiesced to the righteousness of his 

contentions.  That fundamentally confuses 

mootness with the merits.  As this Court has 

explained, a case can be moot no matter how 

vehemently the parties dispute the conduct that

gave rise to the lawsuit.

 Respondent's new test isn't much

 better because it too can be satisfied solely by 

repudiation of the past conduct. And that 

persistent focus on repudiation and the past I

 think lays bare what's really going on in this

 case. The complaint isn't really concerned 

about Respondent's potentially being put back on 

the No Fly List in the future. What Respondent 

wants is vindication for his past placement. 

But that vindication could come only 

through an advisory opinion.  There is no 

prospective relief of any kind that could 

actually redress any cognizable injury that 

Respondent currently suffers or imminently will 

suffer. 

Remember, mootness implements Article 

III's case or controversy requirement.  The 

voluntary cessation exception purpose is rooted 

in preventing gamesmanship or docket 

manipulation in an attempt to avoid judicial 

review.  But that's clearly not what's going on 

in this case, and it's not what's going on in 

other cases either. 

The government has litigated many No

Fly List claims to judgment.  This case, 

however, is 11 years old and Respondent has been 

off the list for the past eight of them. There 

simply isn't a live case or controversy any 

longer, and this Court should hold as much.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the Respondent 

was also concerned about the propriety of the 

procedures that were used to put him on the list 

to begin with and challenged that. 

So how does the declaration that you 

all used, how does that change the procedures 

that he thought were violative of his rights? 

MR. JOSHI: So two responses. 

As far as a procedural challenge goes, 

number one, for the post-deprivation procedures, 

those have actually already changed since the 

time he was first on the list. 

I take the point that maybe he wants 

some pre-deprivation procedures.  Those haven't 

changed.  But I think Alvarez pretty squarely 

forecloses that challenge.  In Alvarez, it was 

the same thing.  The plaintiffs in that case 

complained about the procedures used to deprive 

them of property and the procedures to get their

 property back.  After their property was

 returned to them, the procedures hadn't changed, 

but this Court held that the -- that the

 challenge was moot. 

And I think that just goes back

 fundamentally to the -- the principle behind 

Article III standing and mootness, which is you

 can't -- you no longer have a live challenge to

 procedures if, substantively, you're not 

subjected to those procedures or can't show that 

it's imminent that you're going to be subjected 

to those procedures.  Procedures in a vacuum 

just can't be challenged. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But how would we 

know, for example, and how would he know that 

you have not -- that any circumstances or any 

procedures are different if he's put on the list 

in the future when we don't know the procedures 

or the circumstances that got him on the list? 

MR. JOSHI: So let me take those two 

separately.  With the procedures, again, I'll --

I'll just say procedures in a vacuum you can't 

challenge unless you're substantively going to 

be subjected to them.  So then that's --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah, I understand

that, but we know nothing.  We don't -- how

 would he know a year from now if he is on the

 list with the same procedures or different

 procedures or different facts when he doesn't 

know why he was on the list in the first

 instance?

 MR. JOSHI: Yeah.  So -- so that's the 

key. He does know why he's on the list, and

 we've -- we've made this public, which is the 

standard to be on the No Fly List, in addition 

to reasonable suspicion that you're a known or 

suspected terrorist, is also you must pose a 

threat of conducting or engaging in one of four 

enumerated acts of terrorism, international 

terrorism or domestic terrorism or a violent act 

of terrorism.  He was told that he was put on 

the list because he posed a threat of engaging 

in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and 

was operationally capable of doing so. 

Now I appreciate the fact that he --

he -- you know, that the -- the information on 

which that determination is based is classified 

and that we don't reveal that for obvious 

reasons.  It's based on a totality of 

information at the time the decision is made.

people who satisfy that, and so we know exactly 

what those criteria are.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I give you a 

hypothetical? He does a fundraiser for his

 mosque.  He has no idea that the mosque is under

 suspicion.  You put him on the No -- No Fly 

List. You now give him this declaration that

 says on the -- we're not going to put you on the 

No Fly List for anything that's happened in the 

past. Tomorrow he holds another fundraiser for 

the same mosque.  Can you put him back on the 

list under this declaration? 

MR. JOSHI: So I -- again, I would 

want to know more about exactly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is nothing 

more. You put him on because he did a 

fundraiser for this mosque.  Will this 

declaration stop you tomorrow from putting him 

on the list for doing a fundraiser for that 

mosque?

directly, but I need to -- I feel compelled to,

 moot --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but the 

charge is terrorism activity or the threat

 thereof.  So it's all about activity.

 MR. JOSHI: Yes.  But it's based on a 

totality of information, and the standard is

of four enumerated acts of terrorism. I don't 

think it's reasonable to expect that someone 

will engage in those acts.  And what Respondent 

has is a declaration saying, as of this date or

off not as a matter of grace, not because we 

think you belong on the list but we're just 

taking you off anyway, but was taken off because

 reasonable expectation of recurrence.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it's a strange 

formulation where it says that you have to be 

absolutely certain that there's not a reasonable

 expectation.  I don't really know how to put --

MR. JOSHI: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- those two things 

together, but let's just say it's some degree of 

unlikelihood, okay? 

It's hard to say how -- hard to tell 

how you can prove that without -- convince us of

first place and why he was taken off. 

It's a -- you know, as you say, it's 

based on the totality of the circumstances.  So 

there is the possibility that any additional 

relevant circumstance could be just the thing 

that tips the balance and he could be put back 

on.

because you have the burden of showing mootness.

 But the plaintiff has the burden of showing

 standing.

 So I'm not quite sure what good it

 would do the Petitioner -- I'm -- I'm sorry, the

 Respondent if we say, well, the case isn't moot 

because the government hasn't proven that it's

 very unlikely that you'll be put back on, but 

once you get back in district court, you're not 

going to be able to prove that you have standing 

for purposes of injunctive relief because your 

-- your -- your -- your claim that you're going 

to be -- you may be put back on is entirely 

speculative.  So, anyway, that's why I find it 

perplexing. 

MR. JOSHI: I -- I -- I take the 

point.  So let me try and address both pieces of 

that. 

First, as to, you know, the 

probability of recurrence or whatever, yes, it 

is our burden.  We -- we agree with that. We 

acknowledge that.

acts of terrorism, that this is a U.S. person

 who's the plaintiff.  And I would fall back on

 this Court's case law such as Lyons saying that 

for Article III purposes, it is unreasonable to 

expect a plaintiff to engage in illegal conduct 

again. And in the case of Lyons, even to simply 

be arrested by LAPD again, that was unreasonable

 to expect.

 If that's true for Article III 

purposes, I think you should be just as hesitant 

to expect a U.S. person to engage or to pose a 

threat of engaging in one of the four enumerated 

acts of terrorism. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can someone 

tell you that they're not going to engage in a 

terrorist activity if they don't know what 

terrorist activity it is that you claim they 

did? How can I reasonably be expected to say 

I'm not going to do X when I don't know what X 

is? 

MR. JOSHI: Again, it's -- I don't 

think it's reasonable to expect anyone to pose a 

threat of engaging in international terrorism or 

domestic terrorism --

you're -- you're -- you're arguing the merits of 

the case. You obviously think that you have 

good reasons for putting people on the list. 

And, you know, on the other hand, the -- the --

this suit, the whole gravamen of the complaint, 

is that you were not using good reasons. And we 

can't decide the merits of the case.

 I think that Justice Sotomayor's

 hypothetical is an extremely important one 

because it really asks, what does this 

declaration commit you to? 

The declaration clearly says that you 

can't use any facts that you know of now, so any 

facts that have happened in the past cannot be 

used to -- to relist Mr. Fikre. 

But the question that she's asking is, 

if he does the same kinds of things, if he meets 

with the same kinds of people, if he associates 

with the same kinds of organizations, can those 

same kinds of activities that put him on the 

list before put him on the list again? 

And I do think that you have to give a 

kind of yes-or-no answer to that question so 

that we can figure out what this declaration 

does and does not commit you to.

 those people or organizations and you took him

 off the list.

 But then he starts again, and, after 

all, he doesn't even know which organizations or

 people he wasn't supposed to associate with in 

your mind, but regardless, he starts again, and 

then you put him back on the list.

 At that point, I think how can you 

have satisfied our standard? 

MR. JOSHI: I think because there's a 

difference between an allegation of what we did 

in the past or what he might have done in the 

past and an expectation that he's going to 

satisfy the standard for No Fly List inclusion 

in the future. 

And -- and I take the point that he's 

worried that he's going to do the same things 

and -- and land back on it. I understand that. 

But I think this Court's case law has drawn that 

distinction. 

So even if he -- his claim and no 

court has decided, I agree it's the merits, that 

our placement of him at time one, whenever that 

was, was unlawful for whatever reason,

mootness purposes is could -- could he be 

expected to be placed back on the list at a

 future time.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But doesn't that

 depend on him knowing, as Justice Sotomayor

 said, what might put him back on?  Because, if 

you're assessing is it reasonably likely to

 recur and you don't know what it is that could 

put you back on, it's a little hard to even make 

the assessment.  Or am I missing something 

there? 

MR. JOSHI: So I -- I'll have two 

answers.  One, I -- I want to push back on the 

fact that he needs to know what it is. I -- I 

think maybe what you meant is a court to assess 

it. 

But, on that front, I guess I would 

say no.  I mean, you didn't need to know, for 

example, Mr. Lyons didn't need to say, well, I 

don't know what's going to get me illegally 

arrested again.  The cops are out, you know, 

choke holding me all the time.  But that's not 

how you analyze it.

as true for analyzing his past choke hold 

complaint, you wouldn't expect him to be held in 

a choke hold in the future. Just as a matter of 

law, you say we are not going to base Article 

III on an expectation that the plaintiff is

 going to do something illegal or do something to 

get arrested, and if he does, then he'll have a

 live case at that point.

 I think the same analysis would work 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But what -- let me 

just stop you there.  It's not -- the way this 

works, you know better than I, is not doing 

something illegal.  It's an email.  It's a 

meeting with someone.  It's something that only 

in combination with all the other connect the 

dots, to use the phrase post-9/11, looks more 

suspicious and gets you on the list. 

So it's --

MR. JOSHI: You're -- you're exactly

There are very, very, very few U.S. persons on 

the No Fly List who satisfy that criteria.  It's 

exceedingly rare.  And I take the point that he 

satisfied it in the past and we continue to 

believe he satisfied it in the past.

understand here that what we're really talking

rely on voluntary cessation to claim that he no 

longer has a -- a claim. And I think that's 

slightly different than an analysis of whether 

or not he would have had standing to bring this 

in, you know, under these circumstances if -- if 

for no other reason than the standing sort of 

analysis is on him, right? I mean, it's his

its inception, but the government is now arguing 

that the claim is no longer live because of 

mootness because they have removed him from the

 list.

 And our standard for that is the

 Laidlaw's, you know, standard that we're talking 

about. And so I guess I'm, keeping all of that 

framework in mind, wanting to understand why the 

government's argument about, well, this is on 

the totality of the circumstances and he could 

possibly be put back on the list, why haven't 

you just talked yourself out of the standard?

response to my colleagues suggested that he 

could be put back on the list if he started

that sounds like you lose under the Laidlaw

MR. JOSHI: No, it -- it does not

 MR. JOSHI: And that's why I pushed 

back on the premise when she asked me that 

question, because it's never about doing any one

 thing. It's always a totality of circumstances, 

not even necessarily things that the individual

 him- or herself says or does.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't think 

that that helps you very much.  Let's say it's a 

totality of the circumstances.  There are five 

circumstances.  Then he stopped doing one of 

them, and you thought now there are only four 

circumstances, and it was the fifth one that 

pushed us over the edge, so we're going to take 

him off the list.  And now he starts doing the 

fifth again.  So now we say, well, the totality 

of the circumstances, he's back on the list. 

I -- I don't think it really helps in 

the end that it's a multi-factored inquiry.  At 

some point, you're making a judgment about 

conduct that puts you on the list. And the

 really see where the mootness argument is.

 MR. JOSHI: Yeah.  And I think that if

 you take -- if you accept that argument, Justice 

Kagan, I think you would essentially conclude 

that no No Fly List claim ever could be moot, 

and the voluntary cessation exception, the

 judge-made exception, to Article III would

 swallow the mootness rule.  I don't --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think that might 

be right, I mean -- I mean, just based on the 

theory of the other side, though, because you're 

not going to have the information to know 

whether the person might engage in the --

Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the fifth --

MR. JOSHI: So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- the fifth piece 

of it again. 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah.  So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It would be silly 

for the government to say, oh, this person is 

never going to be on the list again.  That would 

be --

 MR. JOSHI: Right.  So, I mean, I -- I

 think, again, it's -- he says -- his argument is 

that he doesn't know what put him on the list.

 But, if that's -- if that's the claim, then I --

I think, you know, you -- you would -- I think 

the voluntary cessation exception really would

 swallow the rule.

 So, to get back to something I 

mentioned to you earlier, Justice Kavanaugh, you 

know, what -- what if, for example, a court were 

to see this information and determine, oh, it's 

very unlikely for it to recur, I think, on 

Respondent's argument, the case still wouldn't 

be moot because he wouldn't know. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right. 

MR. JOSHI: And so it would always 

have to get to the merits. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No, I think it's 

-- yeah, the -- if the court knew. The problem 

is, for us, to try to assess --

MR. JOSHI: Yeah.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- when we are in 

the dark about what's going on.

 MR. JOSHI: I take the point, but --

but -- but imagine this. I mean, like, imagine 

if a court actually were to review it. Remember

 these are all very rare circumstances to begin

 with, right?  It's a U.S. person posing a threat 

of engaging in terrorism. It's very rare that 

it happened.  These are very rare circumstances 

that would lead to it. 

I'm not sure, even if a court were --

list before.  Oh, keep going.  That's --

MR. JOSHI: No, that's true. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I -- yeah. 

MR. JOSHI: He was on the list before. 

But, if a court were to review it and say, okay, 

I -- I see why he was on the list before, okay, 

I now see why he was taken off, I'm not sure the 

-- a court really has the intelligence 

assessment and institutional competence to 

determine whether these extremely rare events 

and rare combinations of circumstances are 

likely to recur in the future.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So which way do we

 go then?

 MR. JOSHI: I think you would go with,

 well, presumption of regularity. The government 

doesn't put people on the list unless they 

satisfy the threshold, just like we don't assume

 people will engage in illegal --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's not really 

the standard.  The standard is whether it's 

reasonably likely to recur. 

MR. JOSHI: Right.  And --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And that depends 

on your assessment of the person's activity, and 

that's a complete wild card.

been on the list before, all your stuff about 

it's very rare kind of drops out.

this Court, for Article III purposes, has

 frequently said that past instances of 

misconduct by the plaintiff do not allow us to 

infer that he'll engage in that misconduct

 again.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But wouldn't the

 government have to at the very least say

 something like our criteria for making this

 determination has changed so that we understand 

it -- like, that's what reduces the likelihood 

that he's going to be put on again, because, in 

the past, when we looked at it, we had five 

criteria, and now today we have only three, and 

so maybe the government can argue this is moot 

because we've changed the way in which we 

evaluate the circumstances. 

MR. JOSHI: So that would certainly 

moot a case, but I think here it also moots it 

because these intelligence -- in the dynamic 

intelligence environment, every decision or 

delisting decision looks at the totality of 

circumstances at the point in time. 

And he was taken off not as a matter 

of grace.  This isn't like the union fee return

 special individualized treatment. I was going 

to ask you about that --

MR. JOSHI: No. No.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- because --

MR. JOSHI: He was taken off because 

he no longer posed a threat of engaging in one 

of those four acts of terrorism. He no longer 

satisfied the criteria.  That was in 2016.  It's 

now 2024.  So, to the extent there's a concern 

that he doesn't know what got him on the list, 

he doesn't know if he'll repeat the conduct, I 

think time has belied that contention.  If it 

were some sort of innocuous act, presumably, we 

would put him back on it.

show, as required by Clapper and other cases,

 imminent threat?

 MR. JOSHI: I -- I agree completely. 

He's not going to be able to show what's

 required to get injunctive relief.  And, as we

 point out in our opening brief, Respondent seems

 to have abandoned the argument.  He's not going

 to be able to get a declaration either because a

 declaration has to be forward-looking, and at 

the moment, there is no live case or 

controversy.  So even if you were to -- to say 

that the case isn't moot, I -- I don't think he 

would be entitled to any relief at the end of 

the day, which I think just underscores why the 

case is moot. 

I mean, mootness and standing are both 

attempts to implement Article III's case or 

controversy requirement.  I understand that 

mootness is a little more relaxed than standing, 

but both of the exceptions that make it a little 

more relaxed are all about evading review, 

either because the challenged action by its 

nature is so evanescent that ordinary judicial 

review won't complete or because of docket 

manipulation and gamesmanship.

 satisfied in this case unless the -- the basis 

for putting him on in the first place and taking

 him off later is disclosed at least to the

 judge? And so that's what this is all about.

 I'll ask your -- your -- your -- your friend 

whether that's his understanding.

 Are we going to say that this

 sensitive information that you don't want to 

disclose has to be disclosed in any case in 

which somebody who has been on the No Fly List 

wants to contest that? 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah, and that's precisely 

what we're trying to avoid here. And we think 

this is exactly the kind of circumstance where 

the presumption of regularity in national 

security does play a role in that evaluation of 

facts. 

Now a court could look at all the 

classified evidence and then determine whether 

it's likely to recur -- reasonably expect to 

recur or not, or can just hold as a matter of 

law the government is fulfilling its national 

security responsibilities in good faith, it's 

evaluating people against the standard

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- I think 

you're right that he's given up injunction, but

 he wants a declaration.  You don't think a 

declaration that said he wasn't -- he attended a 

mosque, that wasn't enough to put him on the 

list would help so that he could go back to the 

same mosque? 

MR. JOSHI: No. A -- a -- the only 

thing -- first of all, a declaration wouldn't 

presumably reveal classified information, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It wouldn't.  But 

it would -- but it would basically say whatever 

ground that the court has looked at wasn't 

sufficient to put him on the list, so if he 

repeats that conduct, he won't be put at risk. 

MR. JOSHI: So, again, we think the 

Courtright declaration actually tells that to 

him, that he's not going to be put back on the

somebody put back on a list?

 MR. JOSHI: Unfortunately, I -- I 

can't tell you that information. I don't have 

it. I would have to imagine that in the 20-some

 years the No Fly List has been in existence, 

surely there have been some individuals who were 

at one time listed, removed, and then listed 

again. 

I -- I'm -- I'm unaware of any claim

dozen of them.  I'm unaware of any claim there

seems like it might recur again because I don't 

know why you took me off the list. 

You go to the judge and you say,

he's not on the list anymore, here's why we 

don't think he's going back on the list.

it reasonably expected to occur in the future?

 And precisely because it's based on a totality 

of circumstances that's ever changing, that even 

the passage of time itself can cause information 

that once seemed suspicious not to appear so 

anymore, the lack of corroboration can change 

how you view things. 

Because of that, I think a court just

 from institutional competence would have a very 

difficult time making that kind of judgment.  It 

makes much more sense to me to say, look, there

 was being accused of.

 Now the government may very well have

 had good reasons.  I -- I don't for a second

 mean to suggest otherwise.  But an American 

citizen normally has a right to what's been 

called every man's evidence against him. That's

 due process.  That's a pillar of our democracy.

 And, here, the government says, no, 

you don't get that evidence.  I understand.  But 

Justice Kagan suggests an alternative, which is 

at least share it with the judge. At least 

share the facts with the judge and maybe with 

cleared counsel.  And you can do it in a SCIF. 

There are a lot of them.  I imagine you spent a 

fair amount of time in a SCIF preparing for this 

case. 

And you -- the government does that 

all the time under -- under the Foreign 

Intelligence Surveillance Act, under CEPA.  Why 

is it too much to expect with respect to an 

American citizen who's being denied every man's 

evidence that -- that -- that the federal 

government do at least that when -- when -- when

 MR. JOSHI: So a couple responses,

 Justice Gorsuch.

 First, I -- I do need to push back on

 the narrative that he was somehow stranded

 overseas or forced to live overseas.  Even 

someone on the No Fly List can get --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's -- that's

 what he alleges. 

MR. JOSHI: I -- I -- I understand. 

But --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And we have to take 

that as true at this stage. 

MR. JOSHI: But -- but I just want to 

make it clear for the Court that the reason he 

came back in 2015 is because, even though he was 

on the No Fly List, is he had a one-time waiver. 

These are available to any American citizen 

who's overseas on the No Fly List.  That's 

exactly how he came back. 

I presume the reason he didn't seek 

one for the years -- for the four years he was 

in Sweden is because he had a pending Swedish 

asylum application.  I don't know how Swedish 

law works, but I would imagine if he voluntarily

returned that that might affect it.

 So I just want to resist the -- the 

premise that he was stranded overseas. He could 

have come back with the one-time waiver, which

 he, when he requested it, was able to come back.

 The second piece of your question is

 I -- I -- I think the judge in this case, the 

district court in this case, sensibly realized

 that he's not on the list and he's been assured 

he won't be put back on the list based on 

the currently available --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I'm not asking 

about the district court judge.  I'm asking the 

position of the executive branch.  And, again, 

whether he might have had a one -- one ticket 

out of jail free card, but his right to travel 

was thereafter barred or whether he didn't is 

immaterial. 

It's his right to travel, his right to 

every man's evidence.  And is it when those two 

things at stake, is it too much to ask the 

federal government to share with the district 

court in a SCIF enough information to be able to 

assess the mootness question?  Perhaps even 

share it with cleared counsel as it does in so

many other circumstances under other statutory

 regimes.  Why is that too much to ask the

 executive branch?

 MR. JOSHI: So that is exactly what we 

do when these cases get to the merits. If he 

had remained on the No Fly List, that's what

 would have happened.  That's what happens in the

 other cases.  There's no question, Justice

 Gorsuch. 

My only point is, in the mootness 

context, there has been no district court that 

has attempted to invoke those kinds of 

procedures.  We haven't faced that.  And the 

reason I think is that mootness, the Article III 

inquiry, is different from the merits inquiry. 

For the Article III, you're trying to 

make a predictive judgment about expectation, 

and when the standard is threat of engaging in 

terrorism, I think district courts have sensibly 

realized that that is just not reasonably 

expected to occur and we shouldn't think it 

would for the same reason we wouldn't think Mr. 

Lyons would be arrested again.

can summarize, I think your argument is it's not

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I -- I'm very

 Okay. On the -- on -- I'm sympathetic 

to your mootness argument, although I might not 

have sounded like it, but the reason I'm having 

trouble is to squeeze this kind of situation 

into the test we use I find very -- very 

difficult. 

So -- and there are two different 

kinds of scenarios someone could come off the No 

Fly List that I think might affect how at least 

I instinctively look at this.  One would be we 

made a mistake, it's the wrong name, person had 

the same name.  This happens.  And someone comes 

off the No Fly List because it was some -- you 

know, you had nothing to do with anything and 

your name was the same as someone who does, 

okay? If you said that, then mootness seems 

like very easy to establish under the standard 

that we have.

When it's this kind of, well, 

connecting the dots situation, it's much harder, 

I think, to squeeze it into reasonably expected 

to recur because we just have no idea.

 MR. JOSHI: Yeah.  So two -- two

 responses to that.

 One, I -- I -- I think you hit the 

nail on the head with the dynamic nature of

 these things.  It's not like, you know, the 

churches either are or aren't entitled --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yes. 

MR. JOSHI: -- to a grant under the 

First Amendment.  The union fees either are or 

aren't, you know, chargeable under the First 

Amendment. 

Here, it's -- it's not static like 

that. It's not like, if you're an individual, 

you either always belong on or always belong off 

the No Fly List. It's at the moment, do you 

pose a threat of engaging in terrorism. And an 

individual might pose that threat before 2016, 

not pose it since 2016, and, you know, in -- in 

2050 might pose it again.  Who knows?  But you 

can never know that, right?  And I think that 

you're right, that is a distinction here.

And so then the second part of my 

answer is I think we need to remember that

 voluntary cessation is a judge-made exception to

 Article III.  We're still -- we're always

 implementing Article III.  And I think, 

therefore, it's critical not to stray or become

cessation doctrine and why this Court developed 

it. It was to prevent gamesmanship and docket 

manipulation to avoid judicial review, 

post-certiorari maneuvers, other sorts of 

things. 

That's not what's going on in this 

case. We did not take him off the list in an 

attempt to evade judicial review.  And I think 

that should be the touchstone for how you apply 

the reasonable expectation of recurrence or 

whatever the language is for voluntary 

cessation.  Don't untether it from the purposes 

for which the doctrine was developed, because, 

at all times, it -- mootness should not stray so 

far from Article III that they become completely 

disconnected.

hasn't been on the list in eight years.  There

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Joshi, could you 

address the claim made by Respondent and some of 

the amici that the government, in fact, is 

strategically mooting these cases by dismissing 

them? 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah.  We strongly 

disagree with that, and I don't think the 

evidence they cite actually supports the claim. 

I think the ACLU's brief is probably the most 

comprehensive on this front, but if you look at 

the ACLU's brief, what they say is -- you know, 

sometimes, I -- I think it's about half or 

something like that, roughly, of these 

plaintiffs are removed from the No Fly List 

during the litigation. 

Of course, that's the -- that's how 

many U.S. persons are removed from the No Fly

List, just based on the administrative redress 

process, which is what we think is happening. 

So ACLU documents that, well, some of these 

plaintiffs are removed before any briefs are

 filed, and then some are removed after the 

briefs are filed but before a district court

 decision. And then some are removed after the

 decision.  Some are removed on appeal.

 And I look at all that and I think, 

well, that makes sense because they're removed 

as an outcome of the administrative redress 

process and where the agency takes a fresh look 

at the file and says we now no longer believe 

they pose a risk of engaging in the terrorist 

activities. 

If we were strategically mooting, you 

might expect the removals to all come at, like, 

the same point in litigation or with a certain 

kind of litigation trigger. But that's just not 

what's going on at all.  And, of course, we have 

litigated several No Fly List claims to 

judgment, which wouldn't make sense if we were 

trying to engage in strategic mooting. 

So I think, if you look at the 

universe of cases, what is apparent is that in

all of the cases cited by Respondent and I think 

in ACLU's appendix, redress proceedings were in 

parallel to the litigation, and I think it's 

natural to expect that sometimes those 

individuals will be removed as a result of the

 redress process.

 I strongly dispute any notion that

 we're engaged in strategic mooting, and we have

 filed declarations from people occupying the 

same position as Courtright, not in this case 

but in follow-on cases, that say we never place 

someone on the No Fly List or remove them from 

the No Fly List because of litigation concerns. 

And I think that's entitled to deference and --

and respect.

 case involving private parties.  We think

 exactly the same rule applies.

 We do think the national security

 facts on the ground.  I think it's Respondent

situation one in which we can say with 

confidence that it won't reoccur.  So that 

sounds to me like it's pivotal to your argument 

that the Laidlaw standard is satisfied because 

of the nature of what is going on in this case. 

MR. JOSHI: Right.  The standard is 

the same.  It's the reasonable expectation of 

recurrence.  So we are not asking for a 

different legal test in the national security 

context.

 And then, second, the Courtright

 declaration says:  And we're not going to

ask you about the standing question real quick. 

Does the government dispute that Mr. Fikre had 

standing at the time that he filed his suit in 

2013? 

MR. JOSHI: No. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So he 

did. And don't we ordinarily assess standing at 

the time the person brings the lawsuit? If you 

have standing to bring -- to file the lawsuit, 

then, to the extent your circumstances change, 

we now move into the realm of evaluating it 

under mootness, right?

MR. JOSHI: That -- that's correct,

 but I'll point out that Already, which was a

 case about mootness, did mention that, you know, 

in these circumstances where the -- the claim is 

no longer really live, that cases like Lyons and 

Article III apply with equal force, that a

 litigant cannot just rely on speculative 

injuries to keep the case alive.

 So mootness and standing should not be 

interpreted to be that different from each other 

because both are implementing Article III's case 

or controversy requirement.  And that's why, as 

I was mentioning to Justice Kavanaugh earlier, I 

think, we -- we shouldn't interpret the two 

exceptions to -- to mootness that make it more 

flexible than standing unmoored from the 

purposes for which those exceptions were 

developed, which was really evasion of judicial 

review and, in particular, with voluntary 

cessation. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But isn't -- isn't 

-- I mean, Justice Scalia suggested that the 

voluntary cessation exception really is about 

whether or not the case is moot to begin with. 

It's not as though we're accepting that it's

government takes him off the No Fly List and 

then we're looking at is there an exception to 

mootness in this situation.

 Instead, we're saying has the 

government actually mooted the case when it

 takes him off the -- the No Fly List, right?

 MR. JOSHI: Well, I'm not sure about

 that. I mean, Justice Scalia dissented in 

Friends of the Earth. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, he did. 

MR. JOSHI: And he actually would have 

accepted the mootness as just standing in a --

in a time frame.  And so, if you accept that, 

we're happy if you accept that because we 

definitely win this case then.  There is no 

question that if Respondent had filed his suit 

the day after being removed from the No Fly 

List, he wouldn't have had standing at all and 

-- and there would be no Article III 

jurisdiction there. 

So, really, his -- the -- the -- to 

keep his No Fly List claims alive really does 

depend on this delta between mootness and 

standing, even though both implement Article

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GADEIR ABBAS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. ABBAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The government agrees that when a 

defendant voluntarily ceases conduct challenged 

in litigation, it has a heavy burden to make 

absolutely clear that the conduct could not 

reasonably be expected to recur. But the 

Courtright declaration just promises Mr. Fikre 

that he won't be put back on the No Fly List 

based on currently available information. 

That's in -- inadequate for three 

reasons.  First, if our client was previously 

listed for attending the wrong mosque and 

attends that same mosque this year, the 

declaration would allow the government to relist

him. It gets worse.

 Even if he doesn't attend again, but 

the government gets new suspicion-inducing 

information not about Yonas but about the mosque

 itself, the -- the declaration likewise allows 

the government to relist. Any new fact not

 currently known to the government would allow

 Yonas to be relisted, consistent with the

 declaration. 

And if he is relisted in either of 

those ways, that's recurrence of the challenged 

conduct.  He is disadvantaged in the same 

fundamental way his complaint was meant to 

redress. 

Imagine if Nike had promised Already 

not to bring any trademark claim based on 

currently available information but could sue 

for infringement based on new information. 

Under those facts, the Court couldn't have 

concluded that Already could move on with its 

business free from suit. 

Second, the Courtright declaration 

does nothing to guarantee Fikre notice or a 

hearing if he is relisted and, therefore, does 

not address his procedural -- due process claim

at all.

 The government's response is that he 

has no current plans to relist him, but the 

government insists on retaining the right to do

 so. And that's its prerogative, but if it does 

relist him, there is a hundred percent certainty 

that his procedural claim will recur.

 Third, because the government hasn't 

disclosed either to Yonas or a court why he is 

listed -- why he was listed, a court can't 

possibly say anything clearly at all about 

whether recurrence is reasonably likely or not, 

and Mr. Fikre cannot move on with his life in 

the way the lawsuit was meant to allow. 

He doesn't know why he was listed.  He 

doesn't know what might cause him to be 

relisted.  He doesn't know if the next time he 

worships at a mosque or travels abroad he might 

be relisted, massively disrupting his life once 

again. 

Mr. Fikre is peaceful, a law-abiding 

U.S. citizen. He has a live controversy against 

the government and seeks only to litigate that 

case on the merits.  That's it. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  How would the

 government's declaration have to be amend --

amended in order to satisfy your notion of

 mootness?

 MR. ABBAS: Yes, Your Honor.  For the 

substantive due process claim, if the government 

submitted a declaration either to us or to the 

Court itself disclosing the reasons and made a 

promise that matched up with those reasons not 

to repeat them or invoke them or similar ones to 

them, we think that that could moot the 

substantive due process claim. 

For the procedural due process claim, 

if the government described, okay, we didn't 

have notice, now there's notice, you didn't have 

a meaningful opportunity to rebut the evidence 

against you, now here's a meaningful opportunity 

to rebut the evidence against you, in doing 

that, they would be able to moot the procedural 

due process claim. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So you actually your 

-- you want repudiation then? 

MR. ABBAS: No, Your Honor, we don't 

believe that repudiation is required.  We don't

that repudiation is one kind of evidence that --

that shows that the likelihood of recurrence is

 lower.

 And, here, the evidence is not 

neutral. The government didn't take no position

 on its past conduct.  They doubled down.  And so 

that counts against the government in meeting 

its burden.

Honor, they could moot the procedural due

 process claim without disclosing any reasons at 

all about why Mr. Fikre was put on the list

I appreciate that -- you're right, but that's 

not what I was saying. I want to know, am I 

right about the idea that there's no way they

future would hold in terms of the national 

security interests?

 MR. ABBAS: Of course not, Your Honor. 

And I think the government has made it easy by 

saying nothing at all about what it'll do in the 

future, but it could have made a limited

 promise.  It could have said we disclosed -- we 

put him on the list for a mistake, and now we've 

addressed that mistake, and we think that this 

explanation shows that that mistake is unlikely 

to recur, or they said we -- we -- we disclose 

the reasons, we identified that they're illegal 

in X, Y, and Z manner, that's against our 

policy. 

So they --

back to the situation where you're insisting on 

a statement to the effect that they were wrong. 

It was -- in fact, you said it was a mistake or

And mootness has never required that 

type of determination or that type of assertion. 

It's just solely -- it's forward-looking and 

that's the only -- you're not entitled to, to 

establish mootness, a determination that what

 MR. ABBAS: Yes, Your Honor, we agree 

with that, that repudiation is not required.

 And -- but repudiation is forward-looking, even

 though it deals with the past for one. If -- if 

-- if a party acknowledges that what they did 

was illegal, was wrong, or perhaps was not what 

they would want to do or how they want their 

program to work, that -- that's an example of a 

government moving away from its prior decision. 

And the -- the -- the humble fact, the 

humble point, jurisprudential point of 

repudiation is that a party that steps away from 

what it's done in the past is less likely to 

repeat that behavior in the future.  And that's

 That would be like, instead of the --

the Courtright declaration saying currently

 available information, it would have said we --

we disclose here are the reasons we put you on 

the list, we promise not to use those same

That's not what the government did here.

 And because the government didn't take

simplifies this Court's analysis.  There's --

there's simply no repudiation.  There's an

everybody agrees they're on the No Fly List and

 there's standing.

 During the course of litigation, the 

government removes that person from the No Fly

 List. That doesn't make the case moot. That 

triggers the application of this Court's

 voluntary cessation doctrine to determine

 whether it is moot or isn't moot.

 The application of the voluntary 

cessation doctrine is demanding. It assigns the 

government -- it assigns the party moving for 

mootness the burden, and it uses this language 

over and over and over again, absolutely clear. 

And I think, Your Honor, that the failure to 

disclose the reasons for the listing 

short-circuits this Court's analysis of whether 

or not they've met their burden. The --

than the showing that you have to make to defeat

 mootness.

 Here, in this case, we're -- we think

 that the -- where the burden is assigned is

 important and -- and what the case turns on.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't the answer 

also that there's just like no basic 

redressability from the standing standpoint at 

this point in time?  So, in other words, he's 

off the list now.  If he showed up in court 

tomorrow not on the list, initiating a lawsuit 

and asking to be taken off the No Fly List as 

one of his, you know -- or even perhaps a 

declaration that when he was previously on the 

No Fly List, that was a problem, I would think 

there would be a legitimate argument on the 

government's part that he had no standing to 

proceed. 

But what saves you in this case is 

that he actually initiated this when he did have 

standing.  And the government concedes that. 

And so now the whole exercise becomes under what 

circumstance can the government stop the case 

that was already in motion at the time that it

put him on the No Fly List.  He still doesn't

 establishing a baseline that the court can then

combination of factors and the government

Why would -- what kind of guarantee would that

depend, Your Honor, on the reasons that were 

disclosed.  And I know, Your Honor, that's a 

frustrating answer to have to provide, but it --

but it -- it turns on the reasons because, 

depending on what those reasons are, the court

challenged the lawfulness of -- of individual 

reasons or you challenged the conclusion that

Which or both? 

MR. ABBAS: It -- it could be both,

 Your Honor.  The -- both in the sense that the 

government used the bare fact, for example, of 

his lawful, peaceful associations in his

 religious community as a basis for his listing, 

or it could be that the standard was inadequate

 right through to the list.

camera why the person was listed and why the

know anything about how that process works?  And

 thoughts.

 The -- the government, generally

 speaking, does provide some kind of explanation

 as to the reasons for a person's watchlisting 

publicly even. And so this is an exceptional 

case where they provided no information at all.

 In -- in other watchlist cases, the

 government, for example, in Latif v. Holder, 

provided an extensive series of ex parte in 

camera declarations to supplement some of the 

public descriptions, and I believe there was a 

mixture of access that was provided to counsel 

in -- in that case. 

But some of the information that gets 

disclosed ends up being designated as sensitive 

security information.  We -- we've gotten 

cleared on that -- on that basis. 

But, you know -- so there are all 

those options, but the government had all those 

options before they got to this Court. And so, 

before 2018, they decided -- in the first 

application of voluntary cessation doctrine to 

this case, they didn't provide any declaration. 

After the first application, they provided this 

declaration.

 Justice Alito's earlier question of your -- of 

the opposing side? What's the remedy you're 

seeking and how do you have standing for that

 remedy?

 MR. ABBAS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's clarify.

 Are you seeking an injunction?  Are you seeking

 just a declaration?  And why would the 

declaration not violate the law that the other 

side claims it would? 

MR. ABBAS: Yes, Your Honor.  We're --

we're seeking an injunction and a declaratory 

judgment. 

The -- the injunction is the same 

injunction that we saw at the beginning of the 

case to prevent the government from using the 

unlawful reasons that it did to list him and 

from using the same unlawful procedures that it 

did previously. 

And the reason that injunction is 

still viable and live is because the voluntary 

cessation doctrine isn't -- isn't exactly an 

exception to mootness.  It's when mootness 

exists.  And so, here, the -- Mr. Fikre has an

interest in the government not returning to its

 old ways, and so it maintains the interest in

 the injunction.

 But there's even more concrete things. 

The government, by standing by its prior 

decision, indicates an interest in continuing to 

use his past No Fly List status in the future.

 Among many of the things that the government is 

likely to consider about Yonas Fikre when it 

runs into him in the future is the fact that the 

government for a period of five years put him on 

the No Fly List.  And so the Court, this Court 

or another, lower courts, can order the 

government to not use his past No Fly List 

status for any particular purpose. 

Annotate the records, that's something 

that the government has been ordered to do by a 

court in -- after the only No Fly List trial in 

this nation's history in Ibrahim v. DHS.  The 

trial judge ordered the government to annotate 

the No Fly List record that still maintained --

that still existed, expunge the ones that they 

could. And so we think that there's plenty for 

the Court to do on the injunctive side.

he brought this lawsuit was so that he could go 

about his everyday life, and that is what ran

 him into the No Fly List.  A -- a -- a -- a

 decision, a declaratory judgment spelling out

 what the government's authorities are, what

 Yonas's rights should be, will have a -- a --

 meaning to him.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I still don't

be satisfied simply with an injunction that says 

the government is enjoined from using evidence 

that would be in violation of the First 

Amendment?  That wouldn't satisfy you, right? 

MR. ABBAS: I don't think so, Your 

Honor. I think we would have to get very 

specific. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So suppose 

one of the reasons why he was put on was that he 

traveled to Sudan, and suppose the passage of 

time convinced the government that the fact that 

he traveled to Sudan at some point -- I'm just 

speculating, this is not -- has anything to do 

with the real facts -- but let's suppose that 

that's the case.

The passage of time means that having 

traveled to Sudan in the future was no longer

 much -- carried much probative weight and, 

therefore, he didn't deserve to continue to be

 on the -- on the No Fly List.

 So what do you want?  Do you want,

 like, an advisory opinion, if you go back to 

Sudan, you might get back on or, if you go to 

any other country about which there might be 

some suspicion, if you go to Turkmenistan -- I'm 

looking at the whole list of countries that are 

on these various lists -- if you go to 

Turkmenistan, maybe that'll put you over the --

over the top, or if you go to Eritrea?  What 

exactly do you -- could possibly be done? 

MR. ABBAS: Yeah, it's -- I think it's 

a difficult fact-intensive question about what 

injunction would be appropriate, but the 

injunction might be like a higher level of 

generality.  Perhaps it's the government is 

required to make a showing that -- of criminal 

conduct as part of a person's listing.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That would be

 dramatic.  Not to interrupt.

 MR. ABBAS: Yeah.  And I'm just doing 

that as an illustrative change of something that 

the government could do that would not be 

specific to Yonas's fact. 

But the opposite is also true.  The 

government could do something that's only 

specific to Yonas Fikre.  For example, if the 

procedural safeguards that the Court put in 

place -- that the government put in place were 

not generally applicable but were only specific 

to Yonas Fikre, this Court could look at those 

procedural safeguards and say, hey, before the 

government relists him, they're going to call 

this lawyer and they're going to call -- it's 

going to go to this committee and they're going 

to make sure that the terms of the Courtright 

declaration are implemented. 

So there's a way for the government to 

do it specific to Yonas.  There's a way for the 

government to do it program-wide.

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you don't --

you're not satisfied with just the Courtright 

declaration. That isn't going to do anything

 for you.  I still don't -- I don't understand,

 like, he would be entitled to an advisory

 opinion about -- you're worried, and I 

understand it, that he might do this, that, or

 the other thing that he thinks is innocent and 

that might put him over the top and get him back 

on the list. 

But you want a -- a -- you know, you 

want to have him -- he needs to have a number he 

can call up?  I'm thinking of going to this 

particular mosque.  If I do that, is that going 

to put me on the list? I just don't understand 

how you think this is going to work. 

MR. ABBAS: Yes, Your Honor.  I think 

that the only way to determine that would be to 

know the -- the reasons why he was listed and --

and to make sure that the government is not in a 

position to invoke those same unlawful reasons 

again.

 Mr. X has terrorist associations.  So now he

 Z.

 MR. ABBAS:  It gets -- Your Honor, it

 gets very fact-specific. But, again, at a -- at 

a higher level of generality, can the government 

use Yonas's lawful, peaceful associations with 

others as a basis for his listing? 

That could be -- the -- the government 

could take a position that it's not allowed to

association with Mr. X, as well as a future

 MR. ABBAS: Yeah.  And the question

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you want -- you

 MR. ABBAS: Your Honor, I think that

 would for procedural due process require a 

balancing,  a balancing of the government's 

interests, a balancing of the alternatives

interests, as well as the risk of erroneous 

deprivation. 

The stronger the reason that the 

government has for the deprivation, the -- the 

lower the risk of erroneous deprivation is going 

to be. And so, if the government has a -- a --

an overwhelming reason to put Yonas on the No 

Fly List like as the hypotheticals suggest, 

that's going to -- that's going to be enough to 

get the government where it wants to go with 

this list.

to be looking at this, at least as I thought, 

aren't we isolating the merits by essentially 

assuming for the purpose of the determination of 

either standing or mootness that you're right on 

the merits, that the government has engaged in 

unlawful conduct here with respect to how they

 put you on -- your client on the list or

 whatever.

 And the question is separately whether 

or not this is moot or whether or not -- so it's 

not -- I didn't understand that we were to be 

concerned about whether you're right on the 

merits of your argument.  For the purpose of 

this, we say you are, and then we evaluate 

mootness and standing in light of that?

Honor. And our vernacular is the challenged

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SOPAN JOSHI

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSHI: Thank you, Your Honor. 

Just a few quick points.

 I think the discussion right now just

 indicates why there is no Article III case or 

controversy here because it really isn't

 redressable.  I mean, I heard my friend agree 

that if he brought the suit today or even a day 

after I presume being taken off the list, there 

would be no standing. 

And if that's true, I -- I don't think 

you should interpret mootness as being so 

disconnected from standing that we could find 

mootness here even though he's not on the list, 

hasn't been on it in eight years, and is 

guaranteed that that decision to remove him is 

sort of sticky, that it won't be revisited and 

he won't be put back on, unless there's some new 

information that warrants that course of action. 

That's true with you or I or anyone else.  And 

there's no reason why he has a live case just 

because it also happens to be true with respect 

to him. 

Justice Alito, I think you -- you

 asked him, you know, what could the government 

say in a declaration that would satisfy him?

 And I -- I think he had trouble answering that

 for a reason.  There really is nothing we could

 say that would satisfy his test for mootness. 

So it would always have to go to the merits.

 And to be clear, many of the things 

that he wanted in response to Justice Thomas's 

questions for a declaration to say were 

essentially repudiation.  And if I leave you 

here with one thought today, it's that 

repudiation cannot be an element of the test for 

mootness.  So, at a minimum, the Ninth Circuit's 

test is wrong. No one seems to be defending it, 

but I just want to make that clear.  It sounded 

like there was maybe some appetite for a holding 

that says, okay, repudiation is not required, 

the Ninth Circuit is wrong, but if the 

government is going to keep the underlying 

information classified, then a district judge 

should review it in camera ex parte to evaluate 

the reasonable likelihood or reasonable 

expectation of recurrence. 

And I guess, as I said, I would -- I 

would push back on that, but the -- but the one

thing I really want to emphasize is, to the 

extent I think my friend embraced that, he 

seemed to keep saying in terms of, well, you

 know, Mr. Fikre doesn't know what it is he did; 

Mr. Fikre needs to know what he can or can't do 

before being putting on the list.  And that is 

absolutely not how this should work.

 Even if you think a court should

 evaluate the evidence, it should be in camera, 

ex parte.  And at the end of the day, what's 

going to be the result of that?  Let's say a 

court looks at this record, looks at the reasons 

he was placed on the list, looks at the reasons 

he was taken off the list, and then makes a 

determination that it is or isn't reasonably 

likely to recur.  What is a court going to say? 

He's not going to give Respondent any 

information about what that classified 

information is. 

And so Respondent's going to be in 

exactly the same position as if this Court just 

recognizes that, in this context, the standard

Official 

as the Court in Lyons was unwilling for Article 

III purposes to expect the plaintiff even to be

 arrested again, so too should it not reasonably 

expect its citizen to pose a threat of engaging 

in terrorist activities and then just say what I

 think should be obvious from common sense, which 

is there is no case or controversy here any 

longer, there is no injunctive or declaratory 

relief that could be issued that would solve any 

injury he currently or imminently will suffer, 

and call this case what it is, moot. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 1:08 p.m., the case was 

submitted.)
