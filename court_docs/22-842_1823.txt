 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-842, National Rifle

 Association versus Vullo.

 Mr. Cole.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Government officials are free to urge 

people not to support political groups they 

oppose.  What they cannot do is use their 

regulatory might to add "or else" to that 

request. 

Respondent Vullo did just that.  Not 

content to rely on the force of her ideas, she 

abused the coercive power of her office.  In 

February 2018, she told Lloyd's, the insurance 

underwriter, that she'd go easy on its unrelated 

insurance violations if it aided her campaign to 

weaken the NRA by halting all business with the 

group. Lloyd's agreed. 

Six weeks later, she issued guidance 

letters and a press release directing the

 thousands of banks and insurance companies that

 she directly oversees to cut off their ties with 

the NRA not because of any alleged illegality 

but because they promote guns.

 In the accompanying press release, 

Vullo's boss and co-defendant, Governor Andrew

 Cuomo, said he directed Vullo to issue the 

guidance because doing business with the NRA

 "sends the wrong message."  Shortly thereafter, 

Vullo extracted legally binding consent orders 

from the NRA's three principal insurance 

providers, barring them from ever providing 

affinity insurance to the group ever again, no 

matter how lawfully they do so. 

These actions worked as multiple 

financial institutions refused to do business 

with the NRA, citing Vullo's threats.  This was 

not about enforcing insurance law or mere 

government speech.  It was a campaign by the 

state's highest political officials to use their 

power to coerce a boycott of a political 

advocacy organization because they disagreed 

with its advocacy. 

Governor Cuomo essentially conceded as 

much in two tweets responding to this lawsuit in

which he said, and I quote, "The regulations New

 York put in place are working.  We're forcing 

the NRA into financial jeopardy. We won't stop

 until we shut them down."  "It's time to put the

 gun lobby out of business.  #BankruptTheNRA."

 At the motion to dismiss stage, the 

only question is whether these allegations, 

taken as a whole, plausibly plead a First

 Amendment claim.  Because Vullo chose coercion 

over persuasion, they do. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Cole, what is the 

speech here, protected speech, that you allege 

has been suppressed? 

MR. COLE: Promoting guns, advocating 

for gun rights, sending the wrong message. It 

is -- it -- it is that -- the -- it was -- it's 

precisely the speech of the NRA which caused 

Vullo and Cuomo to decide to target their --

their partners and seek to coerce them into 

boycotting the NRA.  So they are seeking to 

penalize the NRA because of its speech 

advocating for gun rights. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So your argument is 

that the sanctions on a third party suppress the

speech of NRA? 

MR. COLE: Yeah, it -- it doesn't it 

-- it -- Your Honor, it doesn't -- it -- it --

the -- the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence

 does not require proof of suppression.  It 

requires proof of burden. If Vullo had imposed 

a $1 fine on the NRA for promoting guns, it

 would be unquestionably unconstitutional even 

though it wouldn't actually suppress their 

speech. 

But, here, we have actually alleged --

and this is at the motion to dismiss stage, the 

allegations are true -- that the NRA has been --

has cost -- it has cost the NRA millions of 

dollars as a result of the kinds of -- of -- of 

coercion that has been put in place here and 

that the NRA, like any other advocacy group, 

relies on banks, relies on insurance companies 

to be able to do their business. And what is 

their business?  Political advocacy. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't the issue of 

coercion different, though, than the First 

Amendment question?  I mean, you are relying on, 

I think, Bantam Books, is that correct? 

MR. COLE: Yes.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  As I read that case,

 there were really two different things going on.

 There was an unconstitutional prior restraint,

 and the Court recognized that.  And there was

 the implementation of that unconstitutional

 restraint through the means of government

 coercion. 

So, if I'm right about that in terms 

of how we should be thinking about Bantam Books, 

then don't we have two different questions here, 

the first being did Vullo actually coerce any 

regulated entities to do something vis-à-vis the 

NRA, and then was that something a violation of 

the NRA's First Amendment rights, say, through 

retaliation or censorship, which are the two 

theory -- First Amendment theories that I pick 

up from your complaint? 

MR. COLE: Yeah.  Justice Jackson, I 

think what Bantam Books stands for is that 

government officials are free to encourage 

people to take -- to -- to -- take down speech 

or to -- to penalize a group. What they are not 

free to do is to use coercion to that end.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand

 that, but --

MR. COLE: So the question is, is

 there coercion?  That's the whole --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, but -- but 

-- but -- but there are two different pieces,

 right? You have to show that there's coercion, 

and you alleged that, but you also have to show 

that that coercion resulted in a First Amendment 

violation. 

Bantam Books is saying you can't do 

indirectly what you can't -- right, what you 

can't do directly.  But the direct thing in 

Bantam Books was a prior restraint.  This here 

doesn't look like a prior restraint.  So what is 

your -- this is sort of Justice Thomas's 

question again, right?  What is your theory of 

the First Amendment? 

MR. COLE: Again, it's the same answer 

as to Justice Thomas.  The First Amendment -- of 

course, the First Amendment prohibits absolute 

censorship or suppression of speech, but it also 

prohibits the imposition of any burden on speech

disapproves of what that entity says --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, but isn't the 

hard part figuring out whether the burden is

 being imposed because of the content of the 

speech or because of the conduct?

 MR. COLE: Well, in my --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I mean, that's -- so 

-- so that's why we have to be really careful 

about what you're alleging is the First 

Amendment problem because the government can

MR. COLE: I agree.  And if this was a 

case in which the government had said, you know, 

the -- the NRA is violating the law left and 

right and we have to respond to that and here 

are the legal obligations, that would be one 

thing.

 saying, I don't like the fact that people use 

guns. I don't like the fact that people 

advocate for the use of guns. We need to stop

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't that her 

motivation? I mean, I understand, that sounds

 to me more like a retaliation kind of First 

Amendment theory, as opposed to something that's 

happening in Bantam Books, which is pressure 

being applied to actual entities that themselves 

are speech distributors so that those entities 

are censoring the speech as -- you know, as in 

their power because they are the kinds of 

things -- they're book distributors or et 

cetera. 

These are insurance companies who are 

being pressured, and so it's at least attenuated 

in that sense, the -- the impact on speech, 

correct? 

MR. COLE: So, if the government were 

providing insurance, it had a contract with --

let's say it provided some sort of insurance to 

advocacy organizations, and it said we'll give 

insurance to some, but we're not going to give

it to advocacy organizations that disagree with 

us and that, for example, promote guns, that 

would be a clear violation of the First

 Amendment.  It would not be censorship.  It

 would not be suppression.  But it would be a 

penalty imposed because of the viewpoint

 expressed by the organization.

 In this case, Maria Vullo herself and 

Governor Cuomo made it absolutely clear both in 

closed-door meetings with Lloyd's and in public 

guidance letters and in tweets about this case 

that they were singling out the NRA not for 

insurance law violations; they were singling out 

the NRA because it promoted guns, and they were 

against the promotion of guns. 

They can advocate against the 

promotion of guns.  They can encourage people 

not to support groups that like the NRA.  What 

they can't do is then invoke the coercive 

authority of her office. 

And look at the guidance letters. 

She -- she could have written an op-ed if she

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  How does your

 understanding of Bantam Books differ if at all 

from Respondent's and from the SG's?

 MR. COLE: So the -- the SG, as you'll 

note, is essentially on our side in this case, 

formerly in support of neither party but taking 

our time because they're supporting reversal on

 the merits question. 

We believe that you do have to 

demonstrate coercion.  You have to demonstrate 

some coercive threat, some invocation of 

regulatory adverse action.  We have that here. 

We have it with the insurance law enforcement. 

We have it with the invocation of reputational 

risk. 

Reputational risk, she didn't just 

say, you know, guns are bad, you should 

reconsider your relationship with the NRA.  She 

said guns are bad, you should reconsider your 

relations with the NRA because it's a 

reputational risk if you don't.

reputational risk, Mr. Cole, that is a real

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It wasn't invented for

 the NRA.  There is a view that bank regulators 

have that companies are supposed to look at

 their reputational risks.

 MR. COLE: Right, right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so how do we know 

-- I mean, I take -- I -- there's obviously a

 lot about guns in that letter.  But it might be 

that gun advocacy groups, gun companies do 

impose reputational risks of the kind that bank 

regulators are concerned about. 

So how -- where do you -- how do

MR. COLE: So I don't think -- I don't 

think you actually have to make that decision, 

Justice Kagan. The -- the question under Bantam 

Books, there's two elements to Bantam Books. 

Did the government urge third parties to 

penalize or suppress speech, one, and two, did 

they use coercion to effectuate that 

encouragement. 

And the -- the invocation of 

reputational risk is the use of coercion.

risk or not, it is still the use of the coercive

 authority of the state to encourage these 

entities to punish the NRA because of its 

speech, to cut their ties. That's number one.

 Number two, look at the Lloyd's

 meeting.  There's no discussion about

 reputational risk there.  She said --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I -- I -- I put the 

Lloyd's meeting in a different category and was 

really more interested in -- in -- I think that 

this is a closer one just because if -- if -- if 

-- reputational risk is a real thing, and if gun 

companies or gun advocacy groups impose that 

kind of reputational risk, isn't it a bank 

regulator's job to point that out? 

MR. COLE: So it -- it -- it -- it 

may well be.  And -- and in Bantam Books, the 

Court says that there's a safe harbor for 

genuine advice about -- about law enforcement. 

This was not genuine advice about law 

enforcement.  Why would she spend four 

paragraphs, you know, denouncing guns?  That 

actually has nothing to do with whether there's

she was trying to do: leverage her authority to 

weaken the NRA because she disagreed with its

 political viewpoints.

 So, yes, reputational risk, if it was

 employed in a content-neutral way to -- to -- to

 address conduct across the board that raises

 reputational risk, that's one thing.  If you use

 it -- it's a very broad term. If you use it to 

target a particular political group because you 

disagree with its point of view and you announce 

that, you know, in your -- in the very document 

in which you're doing it and in the press 

release in which, again, Andrew Cuomo says, I 

directed her to issue the guidance because doing 

business with the NRA sends the wrong message, 

that is not creates reputational risk.  That is 

it -- it supports an organization that I as 

governor disagree with. 

And he can disagree with it. He can 

urge people not to support it. What he can't do 

is, again, invoke the coercive power of the 

state in this way. 

And whether or not there is a 

reputational risk or not I don't think 

ultimately changes the outcome if you're using

 Take Bantam Books.  Suppose in Bantam

 Books the -- the Commission had, instead of 

sending the police to visit and say, hey, how's 

it going, have you taken the books down, they

 said, we're going to send the police to the

 bookstores that continue to sell these books and 

look into code violations, building code

 violations, and they, in fact, found code 

violations, and they enforced those code 

violations against those bookstores. 

They -- that would be a legal 

activity.  The code violations is a legal 

activity. There's nothing illegitimate about 

looking into code violations.  But, if you're 

doing it to give force, give coercive power to 

a -- a -- a -- a -- a government effort to 

encourage a third party to suppress speech, it 

violates the First Amendment. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Cole, speaking 

of violations, the -- your friends on the other

showing for a retaliation claim. 

So how do you distinguish between a

 bringing and a retaliation claim under Nieves? 

And is it just a pleading choice, or do you want 

to say a little bit more about that?

 MR. COLE: Yeah.  So I -- I don't

 think the Nieves question is here at all because 

this is a question about whether the First 

Amendment, the scope of the First Amendment, was 

violated by these actions.

 Nieves is about -- as you know, is 

about Section 1983, where there's a particular 

remedy, a particular damages remedy.  We have an 

injunctive relief claim in this case which 

continues to be live and which would, I think, 

appropriately require taking down the guidance 

letters, which remain on the New York DFS 

website to this day warning businesses not to do 

business with the NRA. 

So we have an injunctive claim.  So 

that takes it out altogether.  But I -- so I 

don't think it's appropriate, but if you're in 

Nieves land at all, this is a Lozman case.  This 

is a case where, remember, Lozman says where the 

-- where the -- where government officials have 

adopted an official policy of targeting speech 

on a matter of concern, public concern for

 retaliation, that's a straightforward

 retaliation case, Mt. Healthy.  It doesn't -- it

 the -- the -- the -- the requirements in Nieves

 don't -- don't apply.

 And so -- so I think whether you're in 

Nieves land or not, this case would have to --

would have to go forward.  But I don't think

 it's appropriate -- it -- it wasn't raised --

discussed below, wasn't raised in the Op, and 

they waive Nieves.  They don't really make a 

Nieves argument.  They waive Nieves argument. 

And then, finally, I would say this 

Court -- Nieves and Hartman were identified as 

narrow exceptions to the Mt. Healthy rule for 

particular criminal contexts.  This Court has 

never extended it to the administrative law 

enforcement context that we have here, and I 

think there would be very serious questions 

about -- about doing that. 

And as to Mt. Healthy, we've clearly 

made out a case. All you have to demonstrate is 

that, as Justice Alito was saying in the former 

case, that you have identified that they have 

targeted you for some adverse action and that

 Well, they've admitted as much in

speech and, if you don't do it, I have legal 

weapons I can use against you and I'm going to 

punish you using those.  That's very clear 

suppression -- coercion.

good thing to do, you'd be a good citizen if you

So how do you define when it goes too 

far along that line?

speaking is a relevant factor in the assessment, 

but the assessment is, at the end of the day, 

would a reasonable person in these -- in this

action against it, of adverse action against it.

 challenged that holding here.

 Do you want to comment on that?

 MR. COLE: Yes. Thank you. 

Respondent never asserted absolute immunity with

 respect to the Bantam Books -- the First

 Amendment claims in this case.  Absolute 

immunity was only asserted with respect to a

 separate selective enforcement claim.  They 

chose, with respect to the First Amendment 

claims, to only assert qualified immunity. 

That's number one. 

So it's -- it was not asserted below. 

It was not asserted in the court of appeals. It

were breaking new ground, and you say I'm not.

 But it seems to me you're trying to in 

the way you're putting this. There's a lot

 about the guidance letters that you agree 

standing on their own would be okay.

 I'm still not sure that if the

 February 18th meeting had not happened, that 

standing alone, that guidance letter, as

 written, would necessarily be coercion. 

I'm not sure the consent decrees could 

be viewed as selective prosecution when there is 

no question, I don't believe, that the Carry 

Guard had provisions, the Carry Guard insurance 

policies, had provisions that violated New York 

law. They reimbursed for criminal activity and 

they reimbursed for intentional acts, which New 

York insurance law clearly says you can't do. 

So tell me -- so, standing alone, none 

of these things might be coercive.  I see this 

as in light of --

MR. COLE: Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the February 

18th meeting, these things now, which is how the 

district court wrote it.  So how would you write 

it differently than the district court did,

 write it differently than the SG would?

 MR. COLE: I -- I -- I -- I would

 write it that Bantam Books holds that when

 government officials encourage third parties to 

penalize a speaker because of its views, they 

cannot use coercion to further that end. Here,

 Respondent used coercion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what do you --

MR. COLE: She -- she used -- she --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- define as 

coercion? 

MR. COLE: The threat, implicit or 

explicit -- and my friend agrees they can be 

implicit or explicit -- of -- of government --

of coercive government action.  That's -- that's 

-- that's coercion. 

And, here, she explicitly threatened 

that to Lloyd's.  She said, I'll go easy on you 

if you cut your ties with the NRA.  That's the 

same as I'll go hard on you if you don't cut 

your ties with the NRA. 

She invoked her authority to punish 

organizations and financial institutions with 

respect to failing to manage reputational risk

and made it clear that what she meant by "manage 

reputational risk" was cut your ties with the

 NRA.

 And then she very shortly thereafter 

announced these consent orders with three of the

 NRA's principal insurance providers in which she

 not only punishes them for insurance infractions 

but imposes an extraordinary ban, a lifetime

 ban, in perpetuity. 

These organizations can never provide 

affinity insurance to the NRA, even if every T 

is crossed and every I is dotted under New York 

law. And with respect to Chubb, one of the 

three, she got them to agree not to provide 

insurance to the NRA anywhere in the country, 

not just in New York.  She has no jurisdiction 

out there. 

So I think, when you look at those 

three -- and I think you -- you -- you -- under 

Bantam Books, you have to look at the -- the --

the -- the -- the -- the government's action as 

a whole, you see that she encouraged third 

parties, insurance companies and banks --

the most significant harm to the NRA is that the

 DFS continues to maintain on its website these 

guidance letters, which essentially put a

 scarlet letter on the NRA with respect to every 

bank and every insurance company in New York.

 Those should be taken down.

 So we would urge you, both for 

purposes of guidance to -- to others and because

 it matters to -- to the -- to the ultimate 

remedy in this case, to address the -- the --

the -- the meeting with Lloyd's, the guidance 

letters, and the subsequent enforcement action. 

And the other thing I would say about 

the meeting with Lloyd's is it was in private. 

It was in private.  So that, we -- we -- the NRA 

might have -- have suffered some damages 

vis-à-vis Lloyd's with respect to that meeting. 

But the real damage in terms of the -- you know, 

putting the scarlet letter on the NRA comes from 

her public actions and Governor Cuomo's public 

actions to issue these guidance letters. 

So I would urge you to address the 

whole picture here, to -- to reinforce Bantam 

Books, and to reverse on the -- on the merits.

How does that constitutional analysis work?

 MR. COLE: Well, that wouldn't be a

 First Amendment problem because I don't think --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why?  What would

 it be?

 MR. COLE: -- there's a First -- but

 it might --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Would it be

 anything? 

MR. COLE: It might be a Second 

Amendment problem.  I don't know.  But I -- I'm 

not sure it would.  I mean, it's -- if it's 

focused -- if the government's coercion is 

focused on conduct rather than speech, then it's 

not a First Amendment problem. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And that's then my 

last question.  On Bantam Books, this a little 

bit unusual, obviously, because it's not going 

to -- the government's not going to a 

communications company, a bookstore, a social 

media company, to say, take down that speech, 

but it's going to an insurance company. 

But I guess I take your point that 

Bantam Books, as long as the ultimate action is 

against speech, it doesn't matter that the

 MR. COLE: Yeah, I think the key is

 it's this use of the third party to punish the

 target.  So, for example, in Bantam Books, if 

they had said, we're going to encourage

 insurance -- those -- those providers of

 insurance, the bookstores --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.

 MR. COLE: -- to stop providing 

insurance, that wouldn't be a speech 

intermediary, but it would be the same problem.

the injunct -- claim for an injunction is no

No, no this Court did not divest itself of 

jurisdiction when it granted the case and asked 

for briefing on only one of the two questions

 presented.

 If the Court reverses on the First

 Amendment ground, it would be totally 

appropriate to send it back to the Second

 Circuit to reconsider the qualified immunity

 question, which is, as Respondent herself argued 

in the Second Circuit, inextricably intertwined 

with the merits determination. 

The Court's assessment of the merits 

here is basically disregard of what happened at 

Lloyd's.  It's adopting every inference in favor 

of Vullo and against the NRA with respect to the 

guidance letters.  All of that infected not the 

-- just the merits determination but the 

qualified immunity determination. 

So the -- the Court has jurisdiction 

over the case. It can reverse on the question 

it took up, and then it can ask the Second 

Circuit --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  What about the 

injunction? 

MR. COLE: And as to the injunction,

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So Justice Kavanaugh 

picked up on what I think might be a critical 

distinction, and I'm just trying to understand 

it. So he said here we have a situation in 

which the government is not acting on a company 

that is itself in the business of speech, which 

is true, unlike Bantam Books, where it was. 

And so what I'm worried about is your 

position ultimately reducing to anytime a 

regulator enforces the law against an entity 

that does business with an advocacy 

organization, we have a First Amendment 

violation because it seemed like your answer to 

him was, well, what gets this into the First 

Amendment column, unlike other scenarios, is

MR. COLE: Yeah.

government was not coercing the speech itself in

 So how do we avoid a world in which 

advocacy organizations are exempt from

MR. COLE: Yeah.  So we're definitely 

not asking for a, you know, advocacy 

organization exemption from regulation or even 

from regulation of third parties.  What Bantam 

Books requires is that the government encourage 

third parties to punish speech.  Once they've 

done that, it --

down or -- or remove speech that the government 

objects to.

between censorship and burdening speech because 

of its content, then maybe that would be

 correct.  But there is no such distinction.

 The First Amendment requires strict 

scrutiny when the government censors speech 

because it doesn't like what it -- its content, 

when it burdens speech because it doesn't like

 its content.

 And in this case, it sought to burden 

rather than censor.  But that doesn't -- it 

doesn't in any way alter the -- the -- the logic 

of Bantam Books, the way Bantam Books has been 

applied for 60 years.  It has been applied 

consistently to situations in which government 

officials --

 disfavored speaker. 

Taking Petitioner's allegations as

 true, that is what Respondent did here. In the 

Lloyd's meeting, she explicitly threatened to 

bring an enforcement action against Lloyd's

 unless Lloyd's "ceased providing insurance to 

gun groups, especially the NRA."

 The Court should find a

 straightforward First Amendment violation under 

Bantam Books, but in recognizing the First 

Amendment claim here, the Court should take care 

to avoid suggesting any new limits on the 

government's ability to speak to the public or 

its ability to provide ordinary legal guidance 

to regulated entities. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Could the government, 

rather than coerce a third-party, simply entice 

them to reach the same suppression -- do the 

exact same thing and suppress speech? 

MR. McDOWELL:  Well, it depends, 

Justice Thomas, what you mean by "entice."  If 

it doesn't rise to the level of significant 

encouragement under --

 MR. McDOWELL:  Well, Blum requires

 overwhelm the -- the judgment of the

 independent -- the intermediary, whereas entice

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  And what would that

 look like in this case?

 MR. McDOWELL:  You -- in -- in this 

case, I mean, I think you could kind of -- I 

think you could think of the offer of leniency 

that Vullo made to Lloyd's as either a form of 

significant encouragement because you're saying 

we will go easy on you for some legal violations 

or as a threat basically saying we will bring 

these enforcement actions against you if you do 

not stop doing business with gun groups. 

So coercion and significant 

encouragement are two sides of the same coin, as 

Mr. Fletcher said earlier. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, 

there's considerable overlap obviously with the 

first case.  Could you articulate what the 

significant differences are between your 

position in this case and the office's position

in the prior case?

 MR. McDOWELL:  There are no

 differences as to the legal principles. The

 difference here is that there is a specific

 coercive threat, particularly in the Lloyd's 

meeting, where she threatened adverse action in

 the form of an enforcement action so that

 Lloyd's would comply with a specific instruction 

to cut ties with all gun groups, especially the 

NRA, whereas, in Murthy, the plaintiffs did not 

identify any instance in which the -- a 

government official threatened to take adverse 

action against a social media company in -- to 

get the social media company to engage in 

specific content moderation.  They just point to 

generic references to legislative reforms that 

were untethered from any content moderation 

request. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it --

are you focusing on the specificity of the 

government action or -- or what? 

MR. McDOWELL:  There -- in Murthy, 

there was no threat at all.  There was no threat 

of adverse action at all.  There were just talks 

about legislative reforms, but they were not

 connected to any specific instruction.

 So coercion in our view requires a 

threat of adverse action connected to a specific 

instruction such that it's saying, if you don't

 do X, we will do Y to you.

 And that was not in the record in

 Murthy.  It is in the record -- or according to 

the complaint here with respect to the Lloyd's

 meeting in particular. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So does that mean that 

really the New York officials could have 

achieved what they wanted to achieve if they 

hadn't done it in such a ham-handed manner?  So, 

instead of having the meeting with Lloyd's and 

-- they -- they just gave speeches about the 

terror -- about guns and how bad the NRA is and 

they spoke about social backlash against guns 

and those who advocate for gun rights in the 

wake of the terrible Parkland shooting, but in 

all of that, they don't mention anything about 

any regulatory authority, and then, after 

harping on that for a while, then they make 

general statements about the importance of every 

insurance company taking into account 

reputational risk, and then they sit back and

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what -- if I --

if what they did was what I just outlined, would

 MR. McDOWELL:  Probably not because 

there would be an attenuation between the 

invocation of legal consequences and the 

instruction or the message.  But we think the 

first four paragraphs of the guidance letters, 

standing alone, are permissible government 

speech because those four paragraphs involved 

criticisms of the NRA and urging third parties 

not to support the NRA. That's the classic form 

of government speech that falls within 

longstanding tradition.  President Reagan 

expressly criticized the KKK and urged citizens 

not to support or associate with the KKK. 

That's what the first four paragraphs 

are doing.

said everything in those first four paragraphs

in some other format, it would be a different

 MR. McDOWELL:  I take the point that

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, they 

understand what a guidance letter is about,

 right?

 MR. McDOWELL:  I take the point that

 the fact that it's in a guidance letter is 

highly unusual.  You would expect to see this in 

an op-ed or a -- or a press conference.  And 

that is a factor, I think, in going to the 

implicit coercive analysis. 

But, without the fifth paragraph, 

there's no invocation of an adverse action at 

all. So the first four paragraphs standing 

alone, although unusual, would still be 

permissible government speech. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  So they -- they 

gilded the lily or whatever the phrase is.  I 

mean, they were ham-handed about this.  The 

people up in New York are rubes. They don't

 MR. McDOWELL:  I -- I don't know, 

Justice Alito, because I don't know that

 insurance companies and banks would feel that 

their will was overborne or that they were 

really at risk of experiencing adverse action in

 your hypothetical.  That's the question.  Are

 the -- are the parties able to exercise their 

own independent judgment? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, seriously, you 

think that sophisticated insurance companies are 

not taking into account adverse risks?  They 

probably had heard about the Parkland shooting 

and the aftermath of it. You think they hadn't 

already taken this into account, and didn't they 

already know all the power that Ms. Vullo had 

over them? 

MR. McDOWELL:  They certainly knew 

about the authority that DFS had, but without 

any invocation of that authority and a tying of 

that authority to a specific instruction like we 

have in the guidance letters, I don't think we

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why are you so

 concerned about only looking at the guidance 

letters in combination with everything else? 

What would be wrong with looking at the guidance 

letters alone, given that there is this fifth

 paragraph?

 MR. McDOWELL:  Yeah.  The fifth

 paragraph, I think, takes you pretty far.  And 

-- and we're not saying that it would be 

impossible to conclude that that would be a 

threat alone, but this was one unit of 

government communication because it was in the 

same 24-hour period and they were all discussing 

the same thing. 

And I think the press release is 

measurably more explicit.  It says it -- it 

"urges businesses to join the companies that 

have already discontinued their arrangements 

with the NRA and to take prompt actions to 

manage their risks."  So it's pointing back to 

the risk management obligations from the 

guidance letter, and it's putting it into one 

sentence to make it very clear. 

And then the Cuomo tweet says the NRA 

is an extremist organization, and he's urging

NRA and consider their reputations.

 And our broader concern is just that

 plaintiffs will -- if -- if the Court -- Court 

were to focus on the guidance letter alone, it

 could allow plaintiffs to try -- try to cobble 

together First Amendment claims by pointing to 

disparate statements of government speech and 

trying to connect them up to invocations of 

legal obligations.  Obviously, it's easier here 

because it's in one document, but that's our 

broader concern. 

And these are also just very unusual 

documents, the guidance letters, and it's kind 

of hard to interpret them in isolation because 

it is very odd to see this sort of government 

speech in a guidance document.

for trial, do -- do you claim that the guidance 

letters and the enforcement actions would not be 

relevant and admissible? 

MR. McDOWELL:  No, Your Honor.  We

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the -- the

 consent decrees?  What about the enforcement

 actions and the consent decrees?

 MR. McDOWELL:  So the district court

 did held -- did hold that she was entitled for

 absolute immunity for those.  We also think that 

they were targeting conduct because they appear 

to have been based on bona fide violations of 

New York insurance law.  So we don't see a free 

speech concern independently with them. 

But I do think that the Lloyd's 

consent decree, again, could bear on the 

plausibility of the allegations with respect to 

the Lloyd's meeting in the following way: 

There's a term in the Lloyd's consent decree 

that broadly bans Lloyd's from doing even lawful 

business with the NRA, and that sheds light on 

the plausibility of the allegation that in the 

meeting, Vullo was trying to coerce Lloyd's into 

stopping even lawful business with gun groups.

of the allegations about the Lloyd's meeting and 

to hinge the First Amendment analysis on the 

Lloyd's meeting because that's an explicit

 threat.

 It's just a straightforward way of

 resolving this case.  And as I said, the 

guidance letters reinforce the plausibility of

 those allegations because the guidance letters

 were sent not only to insurance companies but 

also to banks. And there's no suggestion that 

the NRA was doing unlawful business with banks. 

And, of course, the guidance letters 

also expressly urge insurance companies and 

banks to cut all ties with the NRA, not just the 

lawful business.  So that -- those aspects of 

the guidance letters reinforce the allegation 

that in the Lloyd's meeting, she was trying to 

coerce Lloyd's to stop all of its business with 

gun groups, not just to target unlawful conduct.

clarification. You say the Lloyd's meeting is

 an explicit threat.  So, fine, let's say they 

state a claim. What's next in terms of proof? 

Don't they have to show something about her

 motivation?

 MR. McDOWELL:  So -- so, Justice 

Jackson, that gets to, I think, something Mr. 

Cole was talking about. There are two kind of

 aspects of this sort of claim.  There's the 

coercion question, and then there's the First 

Amendment harm question.  Here, the First 

Amendment harm is based on viewpoint 

discrimination.  So, yes, they would have to 

show that she was motivated by the -- the 

targeting of a particular viewpoint, as opposed 

to the targeting of conduct. 

We just think that the complaint 

alleges that that's what her motive was because, 

on page 223, it says -- I think says it most 

explicitly, 223 of the Petition Appendix, she 

was engaging in this threat in order to get 

Lloyd's to aid DFS's campaign against gun 

groups.  So there's a focus on the speech aspect 

of the NRA, as opposed to any conduct that it 

was engaging in.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The key fact in this case is the 

conceded illegal conduct.  As Justice Sotomayor 

said, the three insurers and the NRA broke the 

law. They were selling intentional criminal act 

insurance, and all of the products they offered 

were unlawful because the NRA refused to get a 

license.  That's why Bantam Books is miles away 

from this case, and it's why the court below 

found qualified immunity protects Vullo. 

In this posture, Iqbal demands courts 

ask, as between the invidious coercion asserted 

or the obvious explanation she was enforcing the 

law, is coercion plausible?  When illegal action 

is present, the plausibility burden is higher. 

To use Mr. Cole's phrase, the government is more 

likely responding to conduct then, not speech, 

and four separate doctrines explain why.

First, Iqbal held plausibility rules 

are especially important in suits where

 government defendants assert qualified immunity 

because they must be neither deterred nor

 distracted from vigorous performance by

 disruptive discovery. 

Second, the presumption of regularity

 is at its height.

 Third, absolute immunity protects 

enforcement actions. 

And, fourth, causation is more 

difficult. 

That is particularly so after 

Parkland, which led many businesses that 

Ms. Vullo has no control over, such as United 

Airlines and Avis Cars, to sever ties with the 

NRA. 

For this Court to accept this thin 

complaint and the teeth of the conceded illegal 

conduct, it would empower strike suits to enjoin 

valid enforcement and open sensitive discovery. 

That's why the court's traditional test here is 

right. A government official crosses the line

 The NRA can't meet that test, and 

that's why they are seeking to weaponize the

 First Amendment and exempt themselves from the

 rules that govern you and me, simply because

 they're a controversial speaker.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Would you spend just 

a small amount of time explaining why you think 

the conduct, all of this, is infected by, I 

guess, the one illegal insurance product 

involved here? 

MR. KATYAL: So, Justice Thomas, our 

position and Ms. Vullo's position throughout has 

been there's not one illegal insurance product, 

it's all illegal.  And the attachments to the 

complaint attach the consent orders which make 

that clear. 

The NRA never got a license for all of 

the affinity products.  It's their burden to 

prove -- I know the word -- "lawful insurance 

product" is in the complaint.  They never 

identified it in the complaint.

 product that was ever insured -- issued by these 

three insurers, and that's why we think, if

 you're asking yourself under Iqbal and Twombly 

is there an obvious likely explanation for 

what's going on, that's what it is. That's why 

the consent orders read the do -- the way they

 do. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sorry, these 

affinity programs could have been altered.  And 

these consent decrees and what she was seeking 

was a ban even of potentially lawful affinity 

programs. 

I mean, if they had taken out the 

intentionality provision or the criminal 

activity provision and just insured for 

accidents with guns or things like that, those 

would have been lawful.

they're at issue in the -- in the consent orders

 by name.

 One is the provision of intentional 

act insurance, sometimes called murder

 insurance.  That violates public policy in New

 York, as almost every state.

 Second, the fact NRA was doing all of

 these affinity products without a license.  Now, 

just without a license alone, DFS routinely 

imposes massive sanctions, including lifetime 

bans. 

For example, in MetLife, which we cite 

in our brief, in 2014, they were offering -- did 

the same thing, offering unlicensed insurance 

with a partner, lifetime ban.  Lifetime bans are 

not unusual.  They happen all the time. In 

securities regulation, you can have a lifetime 

ban for a meeting. 

What normally happens, Justice 

Sotomayor, in these cases is, if the NRA ever 

decided that they wanted to get a license and 

offer a lawful plan, they then come back and 

seek a modification of the consent order. But 

there's nothing unusual whatsoever about a

 punishment like this.

 What is unusual is to allow a strike

 suit like this.  Remember, this case was filed 

during the investigation, in May of 2018, in

 order to stop it from going forward.

 The consent orders then happened.  And 

-- and so now they're here trying to effectively

 undo that enforcement action.  And the worry

 here, it's not just about this case.  It's about 

any case because everyone can allege, what --

you know, can stop a plea negotiation or a 

consent set of negotiations by saying you're 

retaliating against me. 

I mean, you know, if you just think 

about what Dinesh D'Souza said publicly in -- in 

his filings or Michael Avenatti about the 

President, I'm being retaliated against because 

of me -- because of my speech. And that's the 

danger, and that's why there's always been an 

objective unreasonability standard. 

And Mr. Cole says in his brief at page 

23, in his reply brief, oh, don't worry, the NRA 

will never do this, we've only filed one suit on 

Bantam Books before in our history and it's this 

one.

the Lloyd's meeting or the consent orders.

 Now we do think there's a separate 

argument about absolute immunity and there's

 good reason to reach it.  It's -- was ventilated 

down below, and I think it's squarely before

 this Court.

 So here's what the district court said

 at Petition Appendix 53A.  This is its holding. 

"Vullo's decision to enter into the Lockton, 

Lloyd's, and Chubb consent orders and their 

precise terms are all entitled to absolute 

immunity because they are prosecutorial actions 

premised on enforcement decisions intimately 

associated with the judicial process." 

Now it's fair, as he says, we raised 

that in the selective enforcement claim but the 

not in the First Amendment one, but there is 

good reason for that because, at that point in 

the district court, their First Amendment claims 

were focused entirely or almost entirely on the 

letters and the press release and absolute 

immunity we're not claiming attended -- attended 

to those acts.  We're saying it explains what 

happened in the consent orders and in the 2/27 

Lloyd's meeting.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mr. Katyal, it's a 

bit jarring, I guess, for me that the Solicitor 

General is on the other side from you in this

 case given that the Solicitor General represents 

the United States and, as we know from the last

 case, has a very strong interest in not

 expanding Bantam Books.

 So how should we think about that?

 MR. KATYAL: Yeah.  I think, you know, 

I don't want to characterize their motivations 

or anything.  I just think ultimately, when they 

get to, you know, what -- their test is not 

different than our test. 

I think we're all basically in 

agreement that, for example, that the Second 

Circuit got it right. The Second Circuit's test 

is government officials cannot use their 

regulatory powers to coerce individuals or 

entities into refraining from protected speech.

MR. KATYAL: I think the difference is 

that we do have -- insist on an objective

 reasonability when you're dealing with

 enforcement actions, that second prong that I 

started with, because, otherwise, you're opening 

the door to, as Nieves points out, anyone can --

and anyone will be highly incentivized if 

they're the target of an investigation to say

 I'm being retaliated against.  So you need to 

show objective unreasonability, and it's here 

where their claims fall apart. 

They were doing massively illegal 

things.  New York -- New -- New York enforces 

that all the time.  If their complaint pled 

something like jaywalking and said:  Look, 

you're not enforcing it, except against us, that 

states a claim.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, you think 

that's clearly established.  Okay, thank you. 

MR. KATYAL: Yes.  So -- so the 

concern is, without an objective reasonability 

test, you open the door to people filing strike 

suits against enforcement actions all the time. 

Now I guess they then say:  Well, 

okay, it's not the 2/27 meeting with Lloyd's or 

the consent orders themselves.  You've got to 

read that in light of the guidance letters, the

meeting is enough, Justice Kavanaugh, every 

meeting, every plea negotiation's enough.

 That's literally what they are.  They're done in 

secret, behind a closed door, to use their

 insidious language.  That's the natural give and

 take.

 What Vullo said, according to their

 own allegations, is we've got some goods on you, 

and we are willing to look past some in order to 

make a resolution here. 

Now it's true that she and -- and 

Governor Cuomo have said things about the NRA. 

There's nothing that ties that give-and-take in 

the complaint, and certainly not plausibly so, 

to the -- to the -- the feelings about the NRA. 

And, by the way, the tweets that my 

friend has been referring to from Governor Cuomo 

aren't even in the complaint and were issued 

months after the complaint was even filed. 

So I think it's very natural that in a 

2/27 meeting about resolving these issues, 

you're going to say:  Look, I'm going to look 

past some issues in order to strike a 

resolution.  That's all that is. And --

just ask you about the standards again?  So

 suppose I agree with you that illegality was 

sort of at the heart of what was going on here,

 that all of the products were illegal.  Let's 

just assume that I agree with you for a second

 on that.

 Doesn't that go less to coercion than 

to the next question, which is whether or not

 that coercion of a third party affected a 

violation of the First Amendment? 

I mean, the fact that the business was 

illegal doesn't necessarily mean that the 

February meeting wasn't coercive.  I think 

government action in enforcing the law is 

coercive.  So isn't it just that she has a good 

defense to the argument that there's a problem 

here under the First Amendment?

everything except your last sentence, Justice 

Jackson --

in plea negotiations, in bringing criminal

 if you're retaliating against someone's speech,

 and prove."  You've said it four times in the

 that the -- the regulatory action would have 

been taken even if Ms. Vullo didn't have this

 motivation.

 MR. KATYAL: So -- so I think, Your 

Honor, that Nieves directly says no to that. 

What Nieves says is be -- precisely because 

allegations against enforcement are so easy to 

allege and difficult to disprove, and because it 

bumps up against the presumption of regularity, 

and because it opens the door to massive 

discovery into sensitive government files, and 

because it incentivizes people to make 

controversial speech and then claim an 

exemption, no, you insist that this be in the 

pleading itself. 

And that's -- and -- and, you know, 

that's consistent, of course, with, like, for 

example, Iqbal and Twombly, which said similar 

things even outside of the retaliation context.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah.  All right.

 Then stop.  And why are the other program --

 insurance carriers that are -- have these kind

Association, all the other people who have

 similar policies, why are they different? 

MR. KATYAL: Because they didn't do 

what the NRA did here and the three insurers, 

which was not just act as unlicensed but offer 

this -- these insurance policies that seriously 

violate public policy, called -- so-called 

murder insurance, that cover intentional 

criminal acts. 

And when you have those two things 

together, this enforcement action --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought some of 

them did, but I can check the record.  Okay.

 Twombly itself, there were two alternative 

explanations for what was going on with these 

big behemoth government -- big -- big behemoth 

companies.  One was that they were conspiring 

and illegally agreeing to divvy up the market. 

The other was that they made individual

think the only -- the one we haven't talked

 about yet is this reputational risk, these 

industry guidance letters, and we think these

 industry guidance letters are so far removed 

from Bantam Books, we'd urge you to look at 

Footnote 5 in Bantam Books and hold them up

 against the reputational risk letters.

 So, in that -- in there -- in those

 letters, they -- doesn't say anywhere anything 

like we're going to sue you or we're going to 

regulate, unlike what the threat was in Bantam 

Books at Footnote 5, bringing in the Attorney 

General, bringing in the chiefs of police.  They 

don't say that she's even investigating the 

companies for anything. 

There's no reference whatsoever to an 

investigative body.  It doesn't even actually 

say, as the Second Circuit points out, that 

there is any reputational risk with the banks 

and insurers maintaining their ties.  It says if 

any reputational risk.

aren't the only industry letters DFS sends. 

They send them all the time and -- including 

reputational risk letters. And you have amici

 after amici before you saying these are 

milquetoast reputation risk letters.

 And if you want a good example, take a 

look at the one they cite in their brief about

 crypto -- about cryptocurrency at page 23. That 

says companies have legally uncertain practices, 

they make inaccurate or misleading 

representations and disclosures, and that 

agencies are evaluating the legal permissibility 

and compliance with applicable laws and 

regulations. 

Of course, if you're going to issue 

something like that, you're going to have a 

disclaimer like the one that they point out in 

their reply brief.  This milquetoast industry 

letter is the opposite.  And the concern we have 

is that if you point to that as part of a Bantam 

Books claim, then you're going to disincentivize 

people to issue reputation risk letters, which 

are obviously important, as the amici briefs 

say.

you're not suggesting -- I'm skipping back a few 

minutes. You're not suggesting that if, for

 example, after the initial conduct by Ms. Vullo 

and the reaction of the National Rifle 

Association, if she instructed her staff to go

 through these policies and find something, you

 know, that violates some regulation in there, 

that she could then defend against -- the basis 

of terminating all that, on the basis of those 

newly discovered violations? 

MR. KATYAL: Right.  So, there, it 

would be objectively unreasonable.  That's like 

going through to try and selectively target one 

person.  Nieves says that's going to be 

impermissible.  The difference, Mr. Chief 

Justice, with this case is they didn't point to 

a comparator. 

What Nieves is asking is, is this an 

outlier prosecution or not? Their only claim 

is, as Justice Sotomayor was saying, the 

Optometrists Association and the like.  Those 

folks were not doing the same thing at all. At 

most, they were offering an unlicensed affinity 

product.  They certainly weren't offering 

something as dramatically dangerous to public

 That's why what Ms. Vullo was doing 

here was absolutely explainable. There's an 

obvious alternative explanation, to use the

 Twiqbal words.  And that's why, if you let this

 complaint go forward, you will be then saying to

 government regulators everywhere that you have

 to be careful about the speech you say. So, for 

example, last week, some of you heard the 

President say, you know, we beat the NRA, we're 

going to beat the NRA again. 

You heard my -- in the first argument 

a discussion about TikTok and -- and, you know, 

a government -- a hypothetical in which the 

government attacks TikTok and criticizes it. 

The -- all of those things -- those statements 

now will be used as -- in examples in 

affirmative litigation to -- to issue strike 

suits to stop enforcement actions by the FTC, by 

the Justice Department, by states and the like. 

And, Justice Kavanaugh, I am troubled 

by the fact the Solicitor General isn't 

embracing that, but I do think it's important to 

point out many states are.  You have before you

what the Solicitor General's done is to read 

paragraph 5 of the reputational risk letter so

 broadly that it becomes coercive.

 And we just don't think that opinion 

can write, that if you tried to do that, you

 would be opening the door to something very, 

very dangerous and destructive down the road, 

which is this case will be cited, and they've 

already had a track record of using a Bantam 

Books situation in other enforce -- to stop 

other enforcement actions, not just this one.

MR. COLE: With respect to Nieves, he

of thousands occur every day, and adopted a 

particular rule with respect to 1985 -- 1983 

damage actions. 

This is a First Amendment question. 

It's not a 1983 question.  It's a First 

Amendment question that's before you.  This is 

not a retaliatory arrest case. There is -- this

appeals over 60 years involving attempts by the 

government to coerce a third party to punish

 somebody else's speech.  That's very different

 from the Nieves situation.

 So that's just not in -- in the law. 

You would have to change the law substantially

 to adopt that.

           Secondly, with respect to the Cuomo 

tweets, they were issued after the first 

complaint, but they were issued before the 

second amended complaint, which is the operative 

complaint here. And under Tellabs, they are 

perfectly appropriate to consider at the motion 

to dismiss stage, judicial notice.  Nobody 

disputes that he said exactly what he said. 

They want them out of the case because they 

demonstrate the impermissible motive. 

Carry Guard, Carry Guard is a red 

herring here.  The Carry Guard program was 

suspended by Locktons and the NRA in November 

2017. Everything else -- everything that we're 

talking about here happened after November 2017. 

Her meeting with Lloyd's, Lloyd's did not 

underwrite Carry Guards.  And her meeting with 

Lloyd's says cut your ties with gun groups,

especially the NRA, because I'm trying to weaken

 them. Gun groups don't have Carry Guard.  Only 

the NRA did. It wasn't even operative at that

 point.

 The guidance letters say nothing about

 Carry Guard.  This is not a guidance letter

 about insurance infractions.  This is a guidance 

letter about the NRA and other gun promotion

 organizations. 

The NRA's insurance was not all 

illegal.  No, the NRA didn't have an insurance 

license in New York because it's not an 

insurance company.  Nor does the ABA.  Nor does 

the American Ophthalmologists Association.  But 

they all have affinity insurance, and it's just 

run by brokers, as Justice Sotomayor said, in 

New York.  That's perfectly legitimate. 

There were some infractions in terms 

of how it was marketed, how the compensation 

structures, that were actually quite commonplace 

in the industry, and she enforced them against 

them and not against -- against others. 

Finally, the notion that this is 

business as usual, business as usual for a -- a 

-- a government official to speak with a -- a
