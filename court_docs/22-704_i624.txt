 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-704, Vidal

 versus Elster.

 Mr. Stewart.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The living-individual clause of 15 

U.S.C. 1052(c) is consistent with the First 

Amendment.  To begin, I'd like to emphasize 

three points. 

First, Section 1052(c) imposes a 

condition on a federal benefit, not a 

restriction on speech.  Even if Mr. Elster 

cannot register the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL, he can 

sell shirts with that slogan.  He can also 

obtain the benefits of federal trademark 

registration for those shirts by choosing a 

different source identifier.  The 

living-individual clause simply restricts 

Mr. Elster's ability to assert exclusive rights 

in another person's name.

Second, Section 1052(c) is viewpoint

 neutral.  To apply it to any particular

 trademark, the PTO simply asks whether the mark

 refers to an identified individual and whether

 that individual has consented to registration. 

The agency need not and does not consider 

whether the mark is flattering, critical, or 

neutral with respect to the named individual. 

Mr. Elster's speculation about the circumstances 

under which identified individuals will or will 

not consent to registration cannot justify 

treating the provision as viewpoint 

discriminatory. 

Third, the fact that Mr. Elster's mark 

conveys a message about Donald Trump does not 

strengthen his constitutional claim.  Granting 

registration here would likely reduce the 

overall volume of political speech since federal 

trademark registration provides enhanced 

mechanisms for the mark owner to restrict the 

speech of his competitors. 

The fact that this mark contains 

political expression is a further reason to 

hesitate before making those mechanisms 

available.

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Stewart, if we

 agree with you, how would that affect copyright

 law?

 MR. STEWART: I think -- we would say

 that both trademark registration and copyright 

registration are federal benefits, but it

 wouldn't have to follow that exactly the same

 rules that would apply in one context would need 

to apply in the other. 

Clearly, that's true as a statutory 

matter.  There are both federal trademark and 

copyright registration require -- programs, but 

the statutory requirements are very different. 

And the same thing could be true of the 

Constitution. 

And I draw an analogy to -- a rough 

analogy to the Court's traditional public forum 

jurisprudence; that is, even on locations like 

streets and parks, the ability to use government 

property for private communication is a kind of 

government benefit, but the Court has recognized 

that with respect to some types of government 

property, the tradition of making those fora 

available is so strong, so deeply rooted, that

the government needs to show a good reason 

before it limits expression on a content basis.

 And the Court could reach the same

 conclusion with respect to copyright.  The Court 

has described copyright as the engine of free 

expression. Its whole purpose is to promote 

incentives for creative expressive endeavors.

 Trademark has a very different purpose.

 And to -- to -- to point to one 

instance in which -- though, in which it's 

important to recognize that copyright 

registration is a government benefit, one of the 

requirements you have to satisfy in order to 

register your copyright is you need to pay a fee 

to the Copyright Office, and, obviously, that 

would raise huge First Amendment problems if it 

was a condition on engaging in the speech. 

The reason we don't think of it as 

problematic in the copyright registration 

program is that it's not a condition on the 

speech; it's a condition on the benefits that go 

with federal copyright registration. 

So the analysis would have to take 

into account the fact that it's a benefit 

program, but if the question is can Congress

 exclude certain types of creative works from

 copyright protection based on their content,

 that would be an entirely different question. 

That would be something that really has no 

historical analogue, and the Court, in 

conducting the First Amendment analysis, could

 take into account constitutional purpose,

 history, and tradition.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Most of our benefits 

program cases involve money that the government 

gives to a particular grant or something like 

that. Now, in the case of trademarks, don't 

they -- an applicant also pay a fee as they pay 

in the copyright case? 

MR. STEWART: Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And so it seems like 

an odd fit. 

MR. STEWART: It -- it -- it is -- it 

is not a program in which the government 

advances its own money, but that's not the only 

context in which the Court has distinguished 

between government benefits and the -- the 

conditions on government benefits and 

restrictions on speech.

 private people.

 And you can think of trademark 

registration in the same way. That is, the 

benefits of federal trademark registration are 

economic.  Your trademark is placed on the 

Principal Register.  Potential infringers are 

warned away from infringement because they 

understand that they -- they risk potential 

liability if they use the same mark or a 

confusingly similar mark.  If it does come to 

infringement litigation, then the owner of a 

registered trademark has certain presumptions 

available in litigation. 

And all of this is -- is an economic 

benefit.  So it -- in -- in a very general way, 

it's providing the same type of assistance as in 

Ysursa, in Davenport, et cetera. It is making 

it easier for one private party to try to get

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Stewart, can I 

ask you, one of your three points was about

 viewpoint neutrality, and you say this is a

 viewpoint-neutral regulation. And I think, to

 some extent, at least facially, they agree.

 But there is this notion of the effect 

potentially having a viewpoint-disparate impact.

 And I'm wondering whether and to what extent the 

government believes that there is any 

circumstance in which the impact could be taken 

into account when you're considering whether or 

not it's viewpoint neutral. 

MR. STEWART: I mean, I wouldn't say 

that there's no circumstance in the law in which 

impact would be taken into account.  I -- I 

would say it would be anomalous to treat a 

consent requirement as viewpoint discriminatory 

based on speculation as to when people will 

consent. 

And copyright is another example. 

Copy -- as with trademark, under the copyright 

laws, the owner of a copyright can consent to 

conduct that would otherwise be infringing. 

That's obviously a feature of patent law as

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But is that just --

is that just an argument about whether or not

 you believe the effect will actually occur?  In 

other words, suppose we had data or something 

that indicated that they are correct that the 

consent only occurs in one direction. Would

 that be relevant?  Should we take that into

 account or what? 

MR. STEWART: I -- I don't think it 

would carry the day at the end.  I mean, we 

don't -- we don't have the data. And I don't 

think there's really a reason to suppose that 

the -- the withholding or giving of consent will 

depend on the -- the nature of the message. 

One reason that either a trademark 

owner or a copyright owner might withhold 

consent is for fear that somebody else's speech 

will be misattributed to him.  And the risk of 

misattribution is greater when you have a 

neutral or a flattering use of the mark. 

I mean, the -- the one thing, 

presumably, if Donald Trump had been asked for 

his consent to registration here, the one thing 

he wouldn't have worried about is that if people

 reflected his own speech.

 And so we don't think there's a basis 

for believing there will be any systematic skew 

in when people give consent. But, above and 

beyond that, it would really kind of distort the 

application of both trademark and copyright law

 if we thought that a facially neutral 

requirement like consent can be treated as 

constitutionally suspect simply because the mark 

owners are more likely to consent in some 

circumstances than in others. 

And I'd point the Court's to -- to its 

decision last term in Jack Daniels as well. 

That is, the Court decided some legal issues, 

and it remanded for the lower courts to perform 

a likelihood-of-confusion analysis. 

And the Court said in -- the -- the 

Jack Daniel's involved a -- a parodic mark, a 

mark that parodied or mocked the original Jack 

Daniel's mark.  And the Court said, in 

conducting the likelihood-of-confusion analysis,

entities are unlikely to mock their own 

products, and, therefore, consumers are -- will

 was actually produced by Jack Daniel's than they

 might have been if the -- the mark were more

 laudatory.

 And the Court didn't suggest that 

because of that correlation between viewpoint 

and likelihood of confusion the likelihood of

 confusion standard had been rendered viewpoint

 discriminatory or was constitutionally suspect. 

And -- and that would really 

introduce -- havoc is too strong a word -- but 

something like havoc into trademark law because 

likelihood of confusion is kind of the thing to 

be avoided in administering the trademark laws. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Stewart, the 

extent of the government's authority to attach 

conditions to government benefits is a very 

difficult area of constitutional law and 

potentially quite a dangerous one. 

And, as Justice Thomas pointed out, 

the situation here, maybe the -- you know, our 

-- our precedent should be extended to cover 

this situation, but this is quite unlike any of 

the other cases that we have had concerning 

that.

 argument?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, I guess it

 depends on what you mean, if -- if we don't

the -- the -- the legal and constitutional 

equivalent of prohibiting Mr. Elster from 

selling shirts with the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL, 

then we would say it's unconstitutional at least 

applied in that setting because we don't think 

that any government, state or federal, could 

prohibit Mr. Elster from selling those shirts. 

That is constitutionally protected expression. 

If you think that this is meaningfully 

different from a prohibition on speech, it is a 

-- a condition on the federal benefits that go 

with trademark registration, but it still 

warrants heightened scrutiny, we would say it 

can satisfy heightened scrutiny under those 

hypotheses because, here, I mean, it's not just

has been a long tradition of thinking of living 

individuals as having certain proprietary rights 

over their own names.  And, here, the question 

is not just whether Mr. Elster can use Donald 

Trump's name, because he can.  He can market 

expression that is about Donald Trump.  The 

question is whether he can assert an exclusive 

right to use Donald Trump's name and prevent his 

competitors from doing so. 

Now another answer I would give to 

Justice Alito is an important limitation on our 

argument here is that Mr. Elster can sell shirts

look back to the common law of trademark, okay, 

and if I look back to the earliest trademark 

statutes, I see a lot of what we now maybe 

describe ahistorically through our First

 things, and living persons' names.  Those have 

always been areas where there's been some

 limitation on the ability to trademark.

 And I guess I'm saying -- asking why 

not just look to the history here and see 

whether historical evidence comports with this

 being a First Amendment liberty or not?

 MR. STEWART: I mean --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why do I need to go 

down this, you know, because the government 

gives it to you, it can do whatever it wants 

with your -- with you road? 

And it's a very difficult and fraught 

road. We have unconstitutional conditions 

doctrines and a million other things in this 

area, and I'm just not sure why I need to tangle 

with any of that. 

MR. STEWART: I mean, certainly, if 

the Court feels that the historical evidence is 

sufficient to decide the case in our favor, we

it's analogous or may be analogous to the 

Limited Public Forum Doctrine.  I think Justice 

Alito's opinion with the Chief Justice and 

Justice Thomas and Breyer said that in the Tam 

case, and Justice Sotomayor said that in the 

Brunetti case. 

Isn't that the -- the box that if 

you're going to not rely solely on the history 

but in terms of the doctrinal box, that's the 

one that's the easiest fit?

not in any way essential for speakers.

 The -- the only reason I -- I hesitate 

to embrace the analogy further is that the --

the Principal Register, for instance, the 

official PTO publication on which all the 

registered marks are listed, it -- it's really

 not -- having your name put on that is not a way 

of communicating to the public. It is a way of 

warning potential infringers that they risk 

liability if they use the same or confusingly 

similar marks. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if we wanted to 

go down this road -- and I -- I think that the 

two are related, limited public forum and 

government assistance, in much the way that 

Justice Sotomayor wrote in her dissenting 

opinion in Brunetti -- but, if we were to go 

down the limited public forum road exclusively, 

why wouldn't we just say the registration 

program is the forum?  It's not the -- it's not 

the register, it's not the book that's the 

forum, but the registration program is the 

forum, much like, in Christian Legal Society,

 metaphorical forum, if -- if you will, but 

that's what we said in CLS.

 MR. STEWART: I -- I -- I mean, I 

think that would produce the right result 

because we do think that the legal standards 

that apply to limited public forums are the --

the same as the legal standard we would ask the

 Court to apply here.  And, here, it's viewpoint

 neutral. 

The -- the government is saying 

that -- that certain types of marks can't go on 

the register -- on the registry, but -- or the 

Principal Register, but it is not singling out 

marks based on viewpoint.  It is not requiring 

registration in order to -- to speak the marks. 

I guess the -- the two other points I 

would make are, for First Amendment purposes, 

the dispositive question is, is this an 

abridgement of speech?  And so, to the extent 

that the Court thinks it's not an abridgement of 

speech, we're not quite sure what it is, then we 

should win on that basis.

that the bottom line?  I know it's almost as if

labels instead of looking at this, as I do, from

 first principles.  The question is, is this an

 infringement on speech?  And the answer is no. 

He can sell as many shirts with this saying, and 

the government's not telling him he can't use 

the phrase, he can't sell it anywhere he wants. 

There's no limitation on him selling it.  So 

there's no traditional infringement.

 Government action always has to have a 

"rational basis."  The question then in my mind 

becomes, is there a rational basis for the 

government's activity here?  And, clearly, for 

all the reasons Justice Gorsuch pointed out, 

that this type of program depends on content and 

that these kinds of limitations have been 

historically accepted, there's certainly a 

rational basis for the Court -- for the -- the 

government's actions. 

Now, to the extent that it might 

involve speech, one could analogize, but I don't 

think you have to call it a government subsidy 

or call it a limited public forum. They both 

come out, both approaches come out, to what is 

reasonable in this context.

 rational -- rational basis review, but isn't

 that the bottom line?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, and the -- the --

the two --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we don't have

 to analogize it to one or another.  We just have 

to figure out is this speech and say no, it's

think that the -- the government subsidy cases 

and the nonpublic forum cases and the union dues 

cases are kind of discrete exceptions to the 

First Amendment.  Rather, they are illustrative 

of a general principle that often the 

withholding of government assistance to speech 

will not constitute an abridgement of speech.

government is not trying to leverage the 

benefits of the program to coerce speech outside

And so, if the statute said, when you 

sell T-shirts with the -- a mark like TRUMP TOO 

SMALL, you can't get any trademark for those 

shirts registered, even if the trademark you 

choose, like Elster Apparel, would otherwise 

meet the statutory requirements for 

registration. If we had --

is not one of those because, if you imagine two

 T-shirts, each of them says TRUMP TOO SMALL 

across the front, and at the back collar, one of 

them has a tag that says TRUMP TOO SMALL and one 

of them has a tag that says Elster Apparel, the

 communicative value of the -- the shirts is just 

the same. It is not in any way essential to Mr. 

Elster's expressive efforts that he adopt TRUMP

 TOO SMALL as a source identifier, that he adopt 

it as a trademark. 

As long as he can use the expression 

and as long as he can obtain the benefits of 

trademark registration by choosing a different 

source identifier to distinguish his goods from 

others, he has all he needs. 

So I think, yes, the Court could 

reserve the question how would the analysis work 

if a particular plaintiff could show that his

 Justice Thomas?

 So tell me how you think the analysis 

would play out.  Let's imagine that there's a 

similar restriction for copyright and somebody 

wants to write a book called "Trump Too Small" 

that details Trump's pettiness over the years

 and just argues that he's not a fit public

 official.

 Are you saying it would be like a 

rational basis standard for -- for analyzing 

whether that copyright restriction was 

permissible? 

MR. STEWART: Well, it -- it would 

depend on what specific statutory restriction 

did the -- did "Trump Too Small" run afoul of. 

Clearly, if you had a provision of the Copyright 

Act that said you can't get a copyright on a 

book that is critical of a government official 

or former government official, that --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No, you just can't 

use a name, a living person's name.  Without 

their consent, you can't write the book. 

MR. STEWART:  I think I --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Or you can write the 

book, but you can't get copyright protection.

from our position in this case with respect to

 that hypothetical law. That is, you can

MR. STEWART: I think you could say 

heightened scrutiny with respect to 

content-based descriptions in the copyright area 

on -- on the theory that the nature of the 

government benefit program matters.  And 

trademark's purpose has never been to foster 

free expression.  It has been to foster the free 

flow of commerce and to allow consumers to

merchants.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 Justice Thomas, anything further?

 Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Stewart, do you

 think that the constitutionality of this 

provision could be sustained on a theory similar 

to the one in San Francisco Arts and Athletics 

versus U.S. Olympic Committee? 

MR. STEWART: I don't really think so 

because I think in -- in -- that was really not 

a provision of general applicability.  That --

that was intended to protect the -- the 

trademark rights of a particular entity in a 

particular trademark, and there was a -- a 

unique history and a unique motivation. 

Certainly, some of the subsidiary 

things that the Court said in that case would be 

relevant here.  But the -- the other difference 

is that in San Francisco -- in the San Francisco 

case, what you were dealing with was the -- the 

actual imposition of a restriction on speech.

That is, the consequence of giving the Olympic

 Committee exclusive rights in particular words

 was that other people who wanted to -- to use 

the same words in their marketing activities

 couldn't use them.

 And what we have here is something

 different.  We're not -- we're not dealing with

 an infringement case.  We're not dealing with

 the question can Congress passes -- pass a law 

that makes it -- makes it a source of liability 

for particular people to use particular words. 

Really, we have the flip side. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Then --

MR. STEWART: The question is, can 

Congress refrain from giving people exclusive 

rights in particular marks. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I said what I think 

about the government benefits theory in Matal 

versus Tam, so there's no secret about that. 

And if your argument require -- if -- if I could 

not vote to sustain this without saying this is 

the attachment of a condition to a government 

benefit or that it's analogous to the attachment 

of a condition to a government benefit, I -- I 

mean, you don't need my vote to win your case.

 Should the statute be held

circumstances under the party presentation rule, 

or should it be held to be unconstitutional as 

applied in the case at hand? What should one do 

in that situation?

I guess it depends in part on whether your 

objection is really to the theory or to the 

label. That is, if you -- in the -- in the 

following sense. 

If you agreed that there is a 

constitutional difference between refusing to 

register the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL and 

prohibiting the use of the mark TRUMP TOO SMALL 

on T-shirts, if you agree that there is a legal 

difference between the two, but you're hesitant

to characterize federal trademark registration 

as a benefit, we may still be able to persuade 

you because, as I said, the -- the real question 

is whether this is an abridgement of speech.

 And for those purposes at least, part 

of the issue is, is there a difference between

 refusing registration and telling you you can't

 market the shirts.

 The -- the one other thing I'd say 

about Tam is Tam was a case, as -- as you 

recall, in which members of a group of -- a 

musical group of young Asian American musicians 

wanted to register the mark The Slants, and they 

wanted to use that mark because it 

had historically been used as a derogatory term 

for Asians.  And they said, our goal is to 

reclaim and assert ownership of the mark.  They 

wanted to show that they weren't cowed by 

derogatory treatment from others. 

I think, in that case, they had a real 

argument that to express themselves fully 

effectively, The Slants had to be the official 

name of their band.  It wouldn't be sufficient

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Stewart, in 

this context, where the question is not can the 

government prohibit speech but instead has to do 

with the government declining to support speech, 

whatever you want to put the -- what labels you 

want to put on that context, we've frequently 

talked about that it should be reviewable for 

reasonableness. 

And I guess what I want to ask you is 

whether you think reasonableness is the same as 

standard rationality review, because, as I look 

at the cases, like, reasonableness is definitely 

not heightened scrutiny, intermediate or strict. 

But, when the court says we look for 

reasonableness, it tends to do a couple of

expressive opportunities that a speaker has, and 

it tends to look at whether, even though

 something is not viewpoint-based, there's a fear

 that official suppression of ideas is afoot.

 And so that doesn't seem like really 

rational basis scrutiny to me. It seems like,

 look, we understand that this is a sensitive

 area. We -- we're not allowing viewpoint-based 

discrimination.  We also want to look, even if 

it's not facial, is it sort of lurking 

someplace?  We want to look at other expressive 

opportunities. 

So -- so that's my question. 

MR. STEWART: I -- I -- I -- I think 

you are right that there is that ambiguity 

lurking in the Court's opinion -- opinions.  I 

think we would say rational basis is the right 

test, but I think we would also be comfortable 

with the Court analyzing this under a -- kind of 

a slightly more robust standard. 

If you think about the standard that 

an appellate court would apply, for instance, in 

asking whether a trial court's factual findings 

were reasonable or clearly erroneous, I think

 rationality but a lot less than heightened

 scrutiny, so -- so we don't have a -- a

 difficulty with that.

 The -- the one thing I -- I think the

 Court should adhere to with respect to the --

the rational basis standard is it shouldn't be

 trying to figure out what motivated individual 

members of Congress who voted to pass this

He can't register this, but there is a

 speaker-based discrimination.  Could Trump come 

in and register that trademark, because, 

obviously, he can register it, he's giving his 

consent, and then that trademark be valid and so 

it stops Elster from having T-shirts or signs or

 anything that says it?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I mean, the -- the 

limitation on Donald Trump's ability to do that 

is that unlike with patent and copyright 

protection, where you -- you can create the 

thing and exclude others from doing it even 

though you're just sitting on it, it -- it is a 

core requirement for continuing trade -- for 

initial and continuing trademark registration

at least the intent to use the mark in commerce, 

and then the PTO does periodic checks.

he wants to -- he wants to stop this and so he 

does do it in commerce, but he does it, you 

know, in a very limited way.

that it be perceived by consumers as a source 

identifier, then I don't think that there would

 be a constitutional problem.  And that's --

that's something like the same problem that

 arises in infringement litigation generally.

 That is, whenever you have an infringement suit, 

you're seeking to hold somebody liable for

 expression in -- on his goods.

 And the justification is there's no 

First Amendment protection for false or 

misleading commercial speech, and if a 

particular combination of words or images has 

acquired trademark protection, is understood to 

be a representation as to the source of the 

goods, then your putting the same words or 

images on your own merchandise is making an 

implicit representation that they were 

manufactured by somebody other than you. 

Now whether there could be some 

as-applied constitutional claim on the -- the 

theory that if this was all a ruse, if Donald 

Trump's only motive for obtaining trademark 

registration and then engaging in limited sales 

of the goods was to prevent Mr. Elster from 

selling them, I -- I've never seen a case

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, I have two

 questions.  The first is I'm interested in

 understanding more about the government's view

more granular argument about it might take care 

of Justice Barrett's prior concern related to 

copyright. 

So, if we started with where Justice 

Sotomayor does, you know, this doesn't restrict 

speech, so we have rational basis.  I guess I'm 

wondering whether there aren't different 

formulations of rational basis? 

So, on the one hand, you have, you 

know, is this reasonably related to some 

legitimate government interest, or, I guess, in 

the limited public forum cases, we have 

reasonably related in light of the -- or 

reasonably related to the purposes of the 

regime. 

And if we were to -- if you, the 

government, adopts the latter formulation, I 

would think that that could be a way to

 trademark circumstance.

 MR. STEWART: I mean, you could cert-

-- if -- if you wanted to write a limited 

holding -- that kind of went down that road and

 that focused on the particular restriction at 

issue here, what you could say is part of the 

rational basis inquiry here would be, has 

Congress made a reasonable judgment that 

particular categories of words and images are 

not suitable as source identifiers? 

And with respect to the 

living-individual clause, again, there's --

there's not a tradition that living individuals 

can control what people say. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  That's the 

trademark regime.  But, in the copyright regime, 

would -- would you have a different result 

because the purposes are different? 

MR. STEWART: Yes.  I think you would 

say there it is much harder to -- for the 

government to justify withholding copyright 

protection for discrete content-based categories

trying to -- to elevate their own commercial 

products by linking a distinguished individual's

 name to them, there -- there's a strong

 justification for disallowing them exclusive

 rights in another person's name, because there 

has been a historical tradition of people being 

able to control the commercial exploitation of

 their own name. 

And then the second thing is, if you 

look kind of at the category of marks that 

express ideas about the named individual and 

treat that as a distinct category of marks, then 

the First Amendment interests really weigh in 

favor of this provision because what Elster is

The government's defense of the names 

clause, as the discussion so far this morning 

shows, begins and ends with its argument that 

the clause should be subjected only to rational

 basis review, not any form of First Amendment

 scrutiny.

           That is incorrect. For three reasons, 

the clause should be subjected to heightened

 scrutiny.  First, the clause withholds valuable 

legal protections generally available to all 

trademark holders who pay the fee, including 

presumptive validity, protection against certain 

defenses, and incontestability, and it does so 

based solely on the applicant's speech.  That 

selective content-based withholding of generally 

available legal protections is a substantial 

burden on speech. 

Second, the names clause leverages the 

registration system and its attendant rights and 

benefits to achieve a purpose wholly unrelated 

to the purposes of trademark law, unlike the 

separate prohibitions on false association and 

marks likely to confuse or mislead, both of 

which are tightly connected to the purposes of 

trademark law and trademark registration.  The

 government's interest in discouraging marks 

because they hurt the feelings of public figures 

has nothing to do with the purposes of trademark

 registration.

 Third, the names clause involves

 express speaker-based discrimination of the kind 

that lends itself to viewpoint discrimination.

 Under the clause, public figures may use their

 names on registered marks to express their own 

presumably positive views about themselves, but 

no one else can, unless they get consent.  And 

who is going to consent to a critical mark? 

These three reasons require rejection 

of the government's rational basis test.  And 

once that test is rejected, the clause cannot 

survive.  The sole interest that it sought to 

serve was protecting the feelings of famous 

people, but that is not a legitimate reason to 

burden protected speech, much less one that can 

satisfy scrutiny. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what -- what

 speech precisely is being burdened?

 MR. TAYLOR: The burden on speech is 

that my client is being denied important legal 

rights and benefits, what this Court has

 recognized four cases running now are important 

legal rights and benefits, that are generally

 available to all trademark holders who pay the 

registration fee solely because his mark 

expresses a message about a public figure. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Is there a 

distinction between being able to speak and 

being able to register that speech in some form? 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, Justice Thomas, I 

think there's no dispute -- at least I don't 

take my friend to argue otherwise -- that the 

rights and benefits here are valuable.  The 

entire registration system is predicated on the 

idea that they're valuable. 

It's why people go through the trouble 

of registering their marks.  It's why they pay 

hundreds of dollars in registration fees and 

often many times that to -- to obtain legal 

counsel to help them through the process.  It's

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I understand

 that, but if your argument is that somehow your

 speech is being impeded, I think it would be 

good to know precisely how that -- how it's

 being impeded or burdened.

 MR. TAYLOR: Yeah.  So the way I would

 characterize it, our position is that when the 

government withholds important generally 

available legal protections solely because of 

the content of the applicant's speech, that 

imposes a burden on speech because it 

effectively pushes them to use different words 

to receive equal status in the eyes of the law.

MR. TAYLOR: And I think it's that 

kind of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm sorry, 

counsel, your whole answer is making me think 

that you're just conceding the other side's 

point that this is a government benefit, because 

you're not talking about stopping the speech. 

You're talking about not receiving government 

protection for activity that you would like to 

heighten protection for.

from declining to subsidize expressive activity 

in a way that is not con- -- that is not

 viewpoint-based? So there are many cases where 

we've said, even though this is a benefits case,

 you can't discriminate on the basis of

 viewpoint. 

But I don't know of any cases where

 we've said, you know, all this is is a benefits 

case. We're just declining to subsidize certain 

kinds of speech.  And it's not viewpoint-based. 

The -- the grounds for selecting the speech that 

you benefit and the speech that you don't has 

nothing to do with viewpoint. 

I think we've always allowed that. 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, I -- I can't point 

you to a case that's precisely on all fours, 

Justice Kagan.  But I was starting to sketch out

 not viewpoint-based, government can select, 

government can give the benefit to some and not 

the benefit to others.

 And you don't have any cases that go 

the other way.

 MR. TAYLOR: So I'll take those

 questions on -- or those cases on directly. So

 those cases all involved monetary subsidies, 

with the exception of the user fee cases, which, 

as you pointed out, Justice Alito, in your 

opinion in Tam, are really just, you know, 

categorically different for a number of reasons. 

But I think that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't think 

that they're categorically different.  I mean, 

you take, let's say, Finley, where the question 

was monetary grants to artists. Do you think we 

would have come out any differently if the 

program was giving paint brushes to artists or 

if the program was giving marketing advice to 

artists? 

MR. TAYLOR: No, I -- I don't think 

so, but I think what distinguishes Finley is

government funds, it's a scarce resource. It's

Scalia made that same point in his separate

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Mr. Taylor, and

 I -- I don't want to, you know, badger you or 

anything, but that you can find things about 

each of these cases that might be slightly

But what you can't find is a case that 

supports your proposition that when it's not 

viewpoint-based, government cannot make 

distinctions when government is only giving out 

a benefit and not restricting any speech. 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, I -- I -- I'm 

certainly happy to embrace the limited public 

forum analogy that I think has been the subject

 limited public forum reasonableness test.  The

 first is it's not rational basis.  It's --

there's something more going on there. If you 

look at the opinions in Christian Legal Society 

on both sides, I don't think anyone on the Court

 thought that they -- they were engaging in

 rational basis review.  So there's some

 assessment of whether the fit is appropriate, 

and some lower courts have likened that to 

intermediate scrutiny. 

I know your question earlier suggested 

that it's different, but I actually think that 

the reasonableness review and intermediate 

scrutiny have -- are more alike than -- than 

they're different, and neither one is rational 

basis. 

But the second point -- and I think 

this is critically important in this context --

is there is a nexus requirement that exists in a 

limited public forum set of cases.  There's --

the -- the -- the question for the Court isn't 

whether the restriction at issue is reasonable 

in light of any purpose but in the light of the 

purpose of the forum.

MR. TAYLOR: Well, the -- the purposes 

of the registration system, Justice Jackson, you 

can see this in McCarthy, Section 19-2, the goal 

of the registrar is to make registration and use 

as coincidental as possible.  Basically --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, but it -- it's 

not just the -- it's the trademark regime of 

which registration is a part.  And trademark is 

not about expression.  Trademark is not about 

the First Amendment and your -- and -- and 

people's ability to speak.  Trademark is about 

source identifying and preventing consumer 

confusion.

that Mr. Stewart was making the point that by 

having a restriction on people trademarking 

living people's names, the government is 

actually furthering the interests of the 

trademark system because it prevents confusion

 regarding whether or not this is endorsed by the 

living person, this is the living person's

 thing.

 You can imagine a lot of circumstances 

in which having a trademarked name could cause 

confusion in the marketplace.  So why is that 

not a rational basis for saying we won't allow 

people to trademark names? 

MR. TAYLOR: So you're -- you're 

absolutely right, Justice Jackson, that the 

purpose of trademark law in general and the 

purpose of the registration system, as the --

the opinion of the Court in the Jack Daniel's 

case from earlier this year makes clear, is to 

ensure that marks function as -- as trademarks, 

that is, that they function as source 

identifiers, and they don't -- they're not 

likely to confuse or mislead consumers as to the 

source. 

You're totally right about that.

that that clause has because, if it's 

invalidated, then, you know, the government is 

still going to have ample tools at its disposal

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, in thinking

 about whether it's reasonable in light of the 

purpose of the forum, what Justice Gorsuch was 

saying earlier about the historical roots of 

this kind of restriction on use of a living 

person's name would seem relevant and it's been

 around in federal law for a long time as well. 

How do we assess that?  Because 

reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum 

is pretty vague.  History often informs tests 

like that, and the history here would suggest 

that something like this is appropriate.

I'm not aware of history before the Lanham Act 

that would show that.  So, if what Your Honor is

 that was pretty rare.

 And trademarks always had some

 content-based restrictions if you want to use

 that kind of abstract heuristic, geographic 

names, descriptions, functions generally, there 

are always exceptions, but generally not

 trademarkable.

 And I guess I -- I'm kind of stuck 

where my friend down the bench is.  You know, we 

can put whatever abstract labels around it, 

limited public fora, content-based, but, at the 

end of the day, it's pretty hard to argue that a 

tradition that's been around a long, long time, 

since the founding, you know, common law type 

stuff, is -- is -- is inconsistent with the 

First Amendment. 

That might be the case, it can happen, 

but you've got to come up with a pretty good 

argument, right? 

MR. TAYLOR: I -- I think you're 

right, Justice Gorsuch.  And if it's true that 

there's a robust historical record, it hasn't 

been, you know, injected into this case by the 

government, but if it is true that that kind of

 I actually think it would be a

 justification for the law even under heightened

 scrutiny.  And I think, you know, that same

 historical foundation would underlie a lot of 

the provisions in the Lanham Act.

other content-based things, like geography --

description, those have always been 

restricted --

MR. TAYLOR: Yes.

time. 

MR. TAYLOR: I think that's right. 

And so, to the extent that what the registration 

system is doing is just tracking the substantive 

common law of trademarks that predated the 

Lanham Act that has been with us for a very long 

time and is still with us, then I don't think 

there's a problem.  I don't think there's a

 those are going to sail through.

 They've got the -- the -- the

 historical justification, but they also 

ultimately are designed to facilitate the two 

core purposes of trademark law, which is

 ensuring that marks, in fact, function as marks 

and that marks are not likely to give rise to

 confusion or some risk of deception as to -- to

 the source of the mark. 

And as I read all the other provisions 

save for maybe one --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, and sometimes 

we also say, I mean, a trademark is a monopoly 

is what it is. It's a -- it's a state-granted 

patent, old-fashioned patent monopoly.  And some 

things you're just not allowed to monopolize. 

And -- and for whatever reason in 

history, you said, well, you don't get to 

monopolize geographic names.  You don't get to 

monopolize descriptions.  That's enough, isn't 

it, just in and of itself? 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, so there -- I think 

there is a separate provision of Section 2 that 

deals with that, Justice Gorsuch.  So -- so, if 

you look at subsection (e), I think it's the

Amendment values because the whole point of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they 

can't use it the way you want to use it, and you

And so -- and then, in trademark, 

there are things that are kind of close to it

all sorts of litigation.  Presumably, there will

of political expression, that really cuts off a

points on that, Mr. Chief Justice.  I -- I take

 comic -- comical expression about carrying First

 Amendment weight that -- that you want to 

arrogate to yourself here. 

MR. TAYLOR: I think, to some degree, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that is just built into the

 regime.  And so I understood my friend in his 

responses to your question, Justice Barrett, to 

-- to effectively concede that the reason why, 

if the PTO were to register this mark, had the 

former president sought registration of it, the 

reason why that wouldn't give rise to First 

Amendment concerns is because of what this Court 

said in Jack Daniel's, which is that the First 

Amendment and trademark law, when it sticks to 

its historical function, they play well 

together. 

Now that -- I understand the -- the 

concern about there being some chilling effect 

that might exist because, you know, someone 

doesn't want to pick a mark if they're concerned 

about being subjected to -- to infringement 

litigation.  And to some degree, that risk 

exists even without registration, but I -- I

 added benefits.

 I think, if that is a concern that 

Congress wanted to identify, which we're a world 

from that here with this provision, which it was

 clear from the record that Congress was trying 

to make it so that no one used these marks, not 

that so anyone could use it as a source

 identifier.  But, if that -- if Congress did 

identify that as a problem, I think it could try 

to achieve that narrow purpose through a more 

narrowly drawn statute.  But that's just not the 

statute that we have here.  And I --

More narrowly drawn like what?

concern is ensuring that political speech or --

that that -- we don't want to register those

But it wouldn't -- I don't think it would be

 court. If it thinks that's a problem, it can

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Taylor, suppose

 Congress -- excuse me. Suppose Congress passed

 this law.  It says, because each living person 

has a trademark right to his or her own name,

 nobody can register a trademark containing the 

name of another person without obtaining that 

person's written consent. 

Would that be constitutional? 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, I -- it would be 

content-based, and so we think it would be 

subject to intermediate scrutiny. I think there 

would be less a concern about leveraging if 

Congress was legislating on the understanding 

that someone had a trademark right in their own 

name. But I -- I'd ultimately have to see the 

justification to see if it could survive.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if Congress

 says that they do? 

MR. TAYLOR: I think it would present 

a closer question. And I think you might, if 

you were to analyze that under a reasonableness

 standard and -- and there was some real barrier 

on using someone else's name as a trademark

 regardless of whether it were registered or not, 

I think that would be a very different question 

because what's going on there is -- is Congress 

is now trying to leverage the benefits of the 

registration system to do something that it 

can't do directly, which is to discourage people 

from selecting marks that are valid marks simply 

because Congress doesn't like the message 

conveyed there. 

And I think that is what is going on 

here. And, you know --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's --

it's farfetched to think that every person has a

interest, in his or her own name?

 Congress has already tried to do that with the 

separate surname provision that I was mentioning 

earlier. It's trying to ensure that, I mean, if

 everyone has a -- a kind of -- there's a strong 

intuition we all have that we have an inherent 

property right in our own name and the ability 

to commercialize it, that you want to ensure

exists, (c) isn't constitutional?

misleading or, you know, falsely suggesting a

 connection with someone that -- when that

 connection doesn't exist.

 And so then the question would be just 

did Congress go too far to -- to deal with that

 problem.  It would be an intermediate scrutiny 

question or maybe a reasonableness question that

 would probably filter out in the exact same 

place, but I think, when you're assessing a 

particular law, you want to look at the 

practical effect. 

And so, in the -- in the HIV/AIDS 

case, you know, the -- the unconstitutional 

conditions case, there was a separate 

prohibition on using the money for certain 

purposes.  And the Court said, well, assuming --

because that provision already exists, we're 

going to look at this other provision, this 

loyalty oath provision, and -- and, you know, 

it's got to be doing something more, and then 

we're going to analyze that something more that 

it's doing to -- to see whether it's 

constitutional.  And I think a similar analysis 

would be appropriate here.

And I think, once you recognize that 

even if we're in reasonableness land and most of 

these other provisions are going to sail through 

because they're consistent with the history and

 because they're ultimately just trying to ensure

 that trademarks function as trademarks and that

 they don't confuse or mislead consumers, then

 we're really just talking about one or two

 provisions that might have a purpose that's 

wholly disconnected from the purpose of 

trademark law. 

And I think what's so unusual about my 

friend's argument on the other side is that if 

the test is reasonableness for restrictions that 

are related to trademark law and the purposes of 

trademark registration, it's quite anomalous 

that for purposes that are totally unrelated --

if the test is reasonableness for that, that for 

-- for unrelated purposes, where Congress is 

trying to leverage the benefits of -- of 

trademark registration, you would have a lower 

standard, rational basis. 

That's exactly backwards.  I think, if 

Congress is trying to assert some justification 

that is outside the purpose of trademark law,

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I just -- I mean, 

in the end, Congress thinks it's appropriate to 

put a restriction on people profiting off 

commercially appropriating someone else's name. 

And as Justice Gorsuch has detailed, that's long

 been Congress's view.  And even before this

 statute, it's been part of the law.  And --

MR. TAYLOR: Yeah and --

JUDGE KAVANAUGH:  -- that -- that --

you know, we just have to make a judgment, is 

that reasonable. 

I don't know if -- throwing the term 

"intermediate scrutiny" around does nothing for 

me. 

MR. TAYLOR: I -- I think that's fair. 

What I would say is that whether it's 

reasonableness or intermediate scrutiny, I think 

the -- it's really the burden should be on the 

government to try to justify the law.  I don't 

think, you know --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Is it reasonable

 MR. TAYLOR: Yeah.  It might -- I 

think what's so unusual here is the government 

hasn't really tried to show why -- you know, 

what the justification would be, what real-world 

harm is -- is sort of being worked by the 

registration here, as opposed to the use of the 

trademark --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mm-hmm. 

MR. TAYLOR:  -- which, as I understood 

my friend to concede, you know, this is perfect 

-- perfectly appropriate to be used as a mark. 

And, you know, if -- if the former 

President Trump were to bring -- write a public 

-- publicity action against my client, that that 

would fail on First Amendment grounds. 

And so what I would say is that the 

government doesn't have a legitimate interest in

state law, and I think that's the great many, 

you know, sort of applications of this statute 

once you take into account all these other

 provisions that exist.

 And so, if there is a historical 

foundation, I do think it's incumbent on the

 government to identify one.  We brought this 

case as an as-applied challenge, so we're 

willing to give the government another crack at 

it in another case to try to -- to show that 

record.  The only relief we've sought here is 

as-applied relief. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can you just say a 

little bit more about your viewpoint argument?

that the proportion of marks that are rejected 

under names that are critical is different than, 

you know, those that are complimentary? 

MR. TAYLOR: I don't have data, 

Justice Jackson, but what I can say is that the 

government has identified no example of a 

critical mark ever being registered.  And we 

know, we put a few of them in our brief, we know 

there are positive marks that have been

 have to do with consent?  And the question is, 

do you have data related to people not

of examples here where even complimentary marks

 were rejected because people didn't consent to

a few examples.  There are a lot more than exist

trademarks is quite an unusual thing. 

And I think it's -- it just -- it's --

it's a matter of common sense whether someone 

would consent to a derogatory use of their name 

on a trademark and that that's not likely to 

occur. I know of no example of that occurring. 

And on the other hand, I can point to 

examples of positive marks being registered. 

And so I think that that disparity is just part 

of the equation here.  We're not saying that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief

 Justice.

 Mr. Taylor referred to the fact that 

in order for words or images to be registered by 

the PTO, they have to function as a trademark,

 as a source identifier.  And -- and the

 existence of that unchallenged requirement just 

highlights the fact that this is not a 

restriction on speech. 

Imagine that Congress passed a law 

saying the only words and images that you can 

put on your products are words and images that 

function as trademarks, that identify the source 

of the merchandise. 

That would raise huge First Amendment 

problems because it would prevent merchants from 

conveying a range of useful information to 

potential consumers. 

The reason we don't think of that 

restriction as raising First Amendment concerns 

is we understand it doesn't prevent you from 

putting the words on your product.  It just 

prevents you from getting registration.

Mr. Taylor also said that other

 provisions of the Lanham Act, restrictions on 

marks that falsely suggest a connection to -- to 

persons or to institutions and marks that are

 misleading as to source, that -- that those 

restrictions would prevent the registration of 

marks that falsely imply an endorsement.

 And I'd just identify three types of 

scenarios in which those might be inadequate to 

fully protect kind of the historically rooted 

idea that individuals have a property-like right 

in their name. 

The first is that when the PTO applies 

those provisions, it looks to what the average 

consumer would think.  And cases could certainly 

arise in which the average consumer might think 

there's no message of endorsement applied, but 

the living individual might think some people 

will going to mis- -- are going to misattribute 

this to me and I don't want any of it. 

The -- the second scenario and I'd use 

as a hypothetical, imagine a car dealer in New 

York uses as his slogan "the Derek Jeter of Car

I'm saying is I perform my own job with the same 

excellence and professionalism that New Yorkers 

have come to associate with Derek Jeter.

 We -- we could accept the explanation,

 and Derek Jeter could still think, I -- I'm 

offended by the idea of someone with whom I have 

no connection attempting to profit by linking 

his own products to my name and my good 

reputation, and he could worry, if this person 

can call himself the Derek Jeter of Car Dealers, 

next there will be the Derek Jeter of 

Orthodontists and the Derek Jeter of Barbers, 

and the value of his name will be reduced, will 

be diluted. 

And the third scenario is what I might 

refer to as the true suggestion scenario, where 

the Los Angeles Lakers describe their product as 

Jack Nicholson's favorite team or the Chicago 

Bulls describe their product as Barack Obama's 

favorite team or a restaurant in which a senator 

has had dinner uses the slogan Senator X Ate 

Here. 

None of those would really be 

excludable based on the false suggestion clause 

because they would imply a connection between

the living individual and the product, but would 

-- it would be a connection that actually 

existed. And so, nevertheless, there is a 

strong tradition that individuals can exert 

control over their own names to -- to a degree

 necessary to prevent those uses from occurring.

 Now it's true, denial of registration

 under the Lanham Act doesn't prevent the -- the 

hypothetical businesses from engaging in those 

marketing activities.  In order to accomplish 

that, the plaintiffs would have to rely on state 

law rights of privacy and publicity.  But, with 

respect to trademark registration, Congress did 

what it could.  It denied any additional oomph 

that would be provided by federal registration 

to marks that disserve living individuals in 

that manner. 

Thank you.

Stewart.  If you'll linger at the podium just

the United States in an exemplary manner. I

 recall one case in particular from my days in

 private practice 23 years ago in which I was 

counsel for petitioner and you argued in support

 Now, when the opinion came down, I was
