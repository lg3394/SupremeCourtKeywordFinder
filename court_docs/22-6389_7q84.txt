 (10:03 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-6389, Brown

 versus the United States, and the consolidated

 case.

 Mr. Green.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BROWN 

MR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Once more we confront the Armed Career 

Criminal Act, this time with regard to which 

drug schedules a sentencing court is to consult 

in order to determine whether a prior state drug 

crime is a match with those federal schedules 

and, thus, either is or is not a predicate under 

the ACCA. 

We submit that the sentencing court 

should use the schedules that are current at the 

time of sentencing.  That is because, at its 

core, the ACCA is a sentencing enhancement. It 

is not a crime unto itself.  And this Court has 

said that the ordinary practice is to apply 

current law, including at sentencing.

There's no reason to deviate from that

 ordinary practice here.  The statute is phrased

 in uniformly present terms.  The goal of the 

ACCA is to incapacitate only the most serious

 offenders.  And, finally, to do otherwise, as 

the government suggests, would be to ignore

 entirely Congress's choice to change those drug 

schedules with the 2018 Farm Bill.

 With that, I invite the Court's 

questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Green, didn't we 

say in McNeill that looking at the statute is a 

backward-looking exercise? 

MR. GREEN: You certainly did, Justice 

Thomas.  And McNeill, however, is actually a 

complement in some sense for this case, not a 

barrier, and the reason why I say that is that 

McNeill looked at the historical facts of the 

state crime.  We are now engaged in the 

present-tense effort to figure out what the 

federal sentence should be, including a 

potential ACCA mandatory minimum enhancement. 

McNeill acknowledged, as I just said, 

that the statute is phrased in the present 

tense, but McNeill found a particular problem,

and that was that if a state reformulates its

 criminal laws -- and the Court pointed to a

 Sixth Circuit case about how to assess drug

 weight -- different prior state crimes could

 disappear because a court couldn't figure out

 under the new formulations what the maximum

 sentence would be.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So let me ask you a 

question, and then I'll let you go, but what if 

just say, using your logic and your approach, 

there was a crime, some -- a -- a state offense 

that was not on the schedule, it was not 

included on the controlled substance schedule, 

but then, subsequently, after the commission of 

the state crime but before sentencing, it's 

added? How would you -- how would that work 

under your logic or your approach? 

MR. GREEN: Well, if the government --

if the government tried to make that a match, I 

think the defendant might have the opportunity 

to claim that that was an ex post facto 

application of the law.  In other words, it 

wasn't a match at the time of the offense, but 

it is now a match at sentencing. 

And we would say under our approach

that, yes, it is a match, but the Ex Post Facto 

Clause would be a barrier to applying the -- the

 newer drug schedules there.  And, there, you 

would shift back to the drug schedules that 

apply at the time of the federal offense, the

 922(g) offense.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that an

 argument why that -- your reading is strained?

 You're building in an ex post facto problem. 

MR. GREEN: Well, respectfully, Your 

Honor, we're not building in an ex post facto 

problem because there already is an ex post 

facto problem.  In other words, we're not 

avoiding a constitutional question here.  This 

Court decided in Peugh that a -- if, after the 

commission of the federal crime, the sentencing 

range shifted upward, that would be an ex post 

facto problem, and that was because of the way 

that the guidelines anchor the sentence. 

Certainly, here, where we have a 

statute and not any kind of discretionary 

exercise, there would be an ex post facto 

problem potentially with the application of the 

-- the new drug schedules to -- that had a --

that -- that added drugs.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask you what 

purpose your rule has to putting a defendant on 

notice as to what his potential liability may be 

at the moment he commits the federal offense?

 At that point, he has no idea what an

 enhancement may or may not be based on what 

conduct he committed in the state offense or 

even in the federal offense. I'm not sure what 

rule of interpretation would counsel that 

approach. 

MR. GREEN: Respectfully, Justice 

Sotomayor, I think that's an odd conception of 

notice to be honest with you.  When due process 

notice problems arise when a -- an offender 

can't tell where the law is and can't tell what 

the sentence is.  It doesn't usually arise if 

the defendant -- if the -- if the offender gets 

a break on the way to the sentencing forum. 

That's what happened in Dorsey. 

That's what happened in Peugh.  That's what 

happened in Concepcion.  So, if a -- if an 

offender gets a break on the way, the defender 

gets the opportunity to take advantage of that 

break to make the argument. 

We don't -- we don't say that somebody

commit a state crime should have that crime --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except, counsel --

MR. GREEN: -- or should have the

 whole thing --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that's the

 whole I -- I want to say fallacy of sentencing 

enhancements, that somehow, because there's a

 potential for enhancement, there may be a 

decision by a defendant not to commit a crime. 

It's unlikely to ever really happen, 

but accepting that supposition, your rule 

doesn't do anything to enhance rejection of a 

criminal from committing a crime again. 

MR. GREEN: Well, I think our -- our 

rule does do something very important, which is 

to respect Congress's choice to change the drug 

schedules and to narrow the types of drugs that 

are going to go onto the federal schedule.  And 

that, of course, affects the matching exercise. 

So our rule respects the change that Congress 

made in 2018. 

And with respect to the prior notice, 

as I said, I -- I -- I think it's an odd 

conception to say that you should be culpable

 committed yet because you were on notice at that

 time.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Green, can I ask 

you a question about the distinction between

 your approach and the time-of-federal-offense 

approach? Why does it make sense or why would

 it make sense for Congress to say that two

 defendants who were convicted at the exact same 

time should be sentenced differently simply by 

virtue of when their sentencing happened? 

I mean, doesn't the other approach --

if we're not going to choose the government's 

approach, it just seems to me like the 

time-of-federal-offense approach makes more 

sense of the scheme. 

MR. GREEN: Well, any -- any 

line-drawing that's done with respect to the 

applicability or the matching exercise is going 

to create some arbitrariness there, and -- and 

the Court acknowledged that in -- in Dorsey. 

And, in fact, the same sort of 

hypothetical that Your Honor posed was discussed 

in McNeill and also discussed in Dorsey, and the 

resolution there was that a time-of-sentencing

to be, as I say, arbitrariness to any line --

 temporal line-drawing exercise that the Court

 does, the time-of-sentencing position at least 

anchors it in a way that's consistent throughout

 and -- and, according to the Court in Dorsey,

 removes some of the arbitrariness.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And isn't that the 

-- isn't that the sort of way it's ordinarily 

done in the sentencing world?  I mean, I 

understood that under the sort of normal federal 

sentencing process, a federal judge applies the 

sentencing law at the time of sentencing. 

MR. GREEN: That's correct, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So that's the 

standard in sentencing. 

MR. GREEN: That is the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, to the extent 

that we accept that this ACCA is a sentencing 

statute, then the kind of normal ordinary course 

would be to apply a time-of-sentencing rule?

said in the outset, the Court has -- the Court 

has repeatedly said that.  That's also

all the way back to, as we say in our brief, 

Schooner Peggy and Justice Marshall's decision

 that -- that show that you -- as a general

 matter, you apply current law.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, let me ask 

you a question about that, your -- your focus on

 current law.  I mean, you say that you always

 have to apply the current sentencing, and, you 

know, similarly, we always apply the statute 

that's current at the time, which I completely 

agree with. 

Do you disagree, however, that 

Congress could ever enact a statute that 

referred back to a historical drug schedule as 

-- as it would be in this case? I mean, 

wouldn't we still be applying the current 

version of ACCA even if it incorporated by 

reference a prior statute? 

That's not applying an old version, 

correct? 

MR. GREEN: Right.  Congress --

Congress not only can do that, but Congress did 

that in Section 3559(c), which is in essence a 

federal three-strikes law.

you think, the best interpretation. All I'm 

saying is that if we accept the government's

 interpretation, we're not saying that he's 

somehow convicted of a different offense under

 922? We're just interpreting it differently to

 incorporate a prior drug schedule by reference

 in the statutory text itself?

 MR. GREEN: Justice Barrett, I -- I

 would say that you're using -- you're using a 

version of the ACCA in that instance that is 

old, right, and because the drug schedules have 

changed and the ACCA incorporates by reference 

the drug schedules, so you actually would be 

using an old version of the ACCA in that 

instance. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you about 

the federal prong of this?  The -- we -- this 

case arises under the state prong, but it seems 

to me that the sort of weak spot of your 

argument is whether it is requiring a different 

rule for the federal prong than the state prong 

so that when a court is looking back to evaluate 

"serious drug offense," the definition, as it's 

applied under the federal prong, is the court 

just seeing whether or not the person was

 with that, if -- if -- if -- if I think that 

these two should be read in parallel, is there 

an argument that the (a)(1) prong, when it says 

an offense under the Controlled Substances Act, 

is Congress's invitation to look at what the

 offenses are today?

 MR. GREEN: I think, if you said you 

had to read them in parallel, Justice Jackson, I 

would say that (a)(1) should also use -- or that 

in determination of whether there's an -- an 

(a)(1) predicate, you should also use the --

the -- the current schedule. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And is that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what would be 

the -- the justification for that? I mean, if 

you look at the language of (a)(1), it just 

refers to a prior conviction.  It doesn't give 

any sense that there's some kind of 

intertemporal federal-to-federal categorical 

approach going on. 

MR. GREEN:  Well, that's right.  And 

it -- and it is -- and, you know, in -- in -- in 

the event that -- that the Court views (a)(1) to 

be interpreted that way, I mean, we -- we -- the

(a)(2) is really an accident of the fact that we 

have to do the matching exercise, right?

 And so there would be a sensible

 difference between (a)(1) and (a)(2) precisely

 because it's categorical.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. But, if you 

assume that (a)(1) is not doing that, can you 

think of any reason why Congress would have

 wanted (a)(1) and (a)(2) to work differently? 

MR. GREEN: Because -- because 

Congress -- for two reasons.  One is, as I said 

at the outset, Congress only wants to put away 

the most serious offenders.  So, in this regard, 

the ACCA does look prospectively.  The ACCA 

wants to make sure that we are incarcerating for 

a mandatory minimum 15 years the people who are 

the most serious offenders, as I say, and those 

people who wouldn't be the most serious 

offenders if Congress had changed the drug 

schedules, and there's the other point, right? 

I mean, Congress changed the drug schedules, and 

that should be --

 But we're talking about, as the

briefs indicate, we're talking about defense 

attorneys that have to advise their clients of

defense attorney has to go back and look at

there's an argument for lenity here, but I

the need to respect Congress's choice in 

changing the drug schedules is also clear.

 would have to be a match between the state and

 the federal.  Now, if the federal were broader

 and -- or, excuse me, if the state were broader

 So how do you respond to that?

 MR. GREEN: Well, I would respond to 

that by saying that that would simply wipe away 

all of the categorical approach and the work 

that the categorical approach does to see 

whether or not the state drug offense matches 

the federal drug offense. 

Expungement also, Your Honor, is not 

the only thing that can happen along the way to 

the forum, in addition to the categorical 

matching, that would cause the predicate to no 

longer be a predicate.  A defendant, for 

example, can cooperate, and -- and that would 

eliminate the possibility of a mandatory 

minimum, assuming the sentencing court accepted 

the 5k letter from the prosecutor, but --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW ADLER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER JACKSON

 MR. ADLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The 922(g) offense is what triggers 

ACCA's penalties.  The government, therefore, 

agrees that courts must apply ACCA's criteria in 

effect at the time of the 922(g) offense, not 

the prior conviction.  For example, if Congress 

amended ACCA's criteria to delete burglary and 

someone then committed a 922(g) offense, all 

agree that a prior burglary conviction would not 

be an ACCA predicate, even if it was one at the 

time it occurred. 

The only question here then is whether 

ACCA's controlled substance criterion somehow 

warrants different treatment.  And it does not. 

That criterion expressly incorporates the 

substances on the federal schedules.  Under

 basic rules of statutory construction, that

 means the substances are effectively written

 into ACCA itself.  So where a substance is 

removed from the schedules before the 922(g) 

offense, it is also removed from ACCA's 

coverage, no less than burglary in the

 hypothetical.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Subsection (e)(1) 

says that in the case of a person who violates 

Section 922(g) of this title and has three 

previous convictions.  So we're talking about 

the previous convictions. 

Why would we look at a current 

interpretation -- or a current violation to 

determine whether or not the previous conviction 

was -- fit within the statute? 

MR. ADLER: So, Your Honor, that is 

the language that this Court interpreted in 

McNeill, and when it did so, it was referring to 

the historical attributes of the state law 

conviction. 

McNeill said nothing about the federal 

comparator against which we are comparing those 

attributes.  And that question is governed by

the default principle, the time-of-offense

 principle with which -- the government and we

 agree on that.

 So it's an entirely different question

 here. Previous conviction, that's something

 that's already happened.  So, of course, we're 

going to look at the law in effect at the time

 of the prior.

 The government is not arguing to you 

as I understand it that we should be looking at 

the federal criteria in effect at the time of 

the prior conviction.  What I understand the 

government to be saying is that somehow this 

controlled substance criteria in ACCA is somehow 

different than every other criteria. 

That's why the burglary hypothetical 

is correct because, even though the burglary 

qualified under ACCA at the time it occurred, it 

-- Congress is revising its judgment and saying 

we no longer think burglary should count. 

So, if that happens by the time of the 

922(g) offense, then everyone agrees, I believe 

the government agrees, that that burglary should 

not qualify.  So it's important to recognize 

that McNeill was addressing a completely

different question than is presented in this 

case. That's why it was such an easy case, we

 say.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So you don't think

 there's any difference between the reference to 

the schedule and actually amending the

 underlying statute?

 MR. ADLER: That is correct, Your

 Honor. And that is -- that is absolutely 

correct.  And the government gives us a single 

sentence in its brief about why that would not 

be on page 41, and it's no supporting authority. 

And all the government says is, well, the 

schedules are not contained in ACCA and so 

amending the schedules is not the equivalent of 

amending ACCA. 

But, as we explain on pages 8 to 9 of 

our reply brief, that is simply not true.  Under 

established canons of statutory construction, 

where one statute incorporates another or 

cross-references another, that latter statute is 

effectively contained and written into the 

former.  That's how cross-references work.

what it says here, that would have a profoundly

 country.  Congress would have to copy and paste

 every statute that it wants to reference, and 

if, you know, you think the U.S. Code is 

unwieldy already, it would explode if that's

 what Congress had to do.  And so that cannot

 possibly be right.

 So then we are left asking:  Well, how 

-- how are the schedules any different here than 

the burglary or anything like that?  So that's 

why you see the government relying so much on 

McNeill.  But I don't think the government 

believes that argument either because, if you 

really take the government's view of McNeill, 

then what you're really doing is looking at the 

federal criteria in ACCA at the time of the 

prior for all of the criteria.  And that is not 

the government's submission in this case.  That 

proves far too much. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I thought the 

reason it -- it mattered in McNeill or the 

argument in McNeill was that the prior state 

conviction no longer qualified as a serious drug 

offense because the change in the maximum 

sentence under state law, but the key was that

change subsequent to the prior state offense

 means that it no longer qualifies as a serious 

drug offense under ACCA. Yet, in McNeill -- I

that didn't matter?

 MR. ADLER: Because states do not get

 to decide what is serious enough for ACCA.  So I

 can give -- if I can give you a hypothetical

 that's a variation of the burglary example.

 Let's say Congress raises the

 statutory maximum threshold from 10 to 20 years.

 Someone then commits a 922(g) offense.  They 

have a statutory maximum and their prior does of 

15 years.  That's not going to qualify because 

Congress has revised its judgment. 

McNeill only says that we look to 

state law in effect at the time of the prior to 

figure out what the maximum was. That's the 15 

years. But Congress gets to decide if that's 

serious enough or not for ACCA.  The states 

don't get to do that. 

So that's why the state -- change in 

state law had really nothing to do with the 

question we are asking here, which is what 

federal criteria are we looking at.  And, again, 

this is where the default time-of-offense 

principle comes in that is grounded in the

 question on that.  It would have meant that it

 was a serious drug offense for federal law 

purposes at the time he committed the state

 offense, correct?

 MR. ADLER: That -- that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But then was no

 longer a serious drug offense for purposes of

 federal law later on, correct?

 MR. ADLER: That's correct.  That's 

exactly the same thing as the burglary 

hypothetical with which the government agrees. 

It would have qualified at the time it occurred, 

but then Congress changes its judgment and says 

we don't want burglaries anymore or we think the 

statutory maximum should be 20 years, so even 

though it would have qualified at the time it 

occurred, it no longer does at the time of the 

922(g) offense. 

And, again, this time-of-offense 

principle is a default rule in federal criminal 

law. It's --

that you do it at the time of the sentencing?

 MR. ADLER: No, Your Honor, I agree

 with that in terms of the guidelines because the 

Sentencing Reform Act specifically says for the 

guidelines you look to the version in effect at

 sentencing.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mm-hmm. 

MR. ADLER: But, when we're talking 

about federal statutory penalties, that's where 

the federal saving statute comes in, that's 

where the Ex Post Facto Clause comes in, and 

under those doctrines, we are always looking at 

the federal statutory penalties in effect at the 

time of the crime.  That is when we are looking 

at notice.  Is someone on notice that their 

conduct is unlawful? And what are the potential 

consequences for violating the law?  That 

happens at the time of the offense, right? 

So the government is trying to look at 

notice at the time of the prior conviction, 

which cannot possibly right -- be right because 

it would mean that ACCA could not apply to prior 

convictions that predated its enactment. That

 We know that it does not from this 

Court's decision in Gryger versus Burke, so that 

confirms that we're looking at notice at the 

time of the 922(g) offense, and then, once we do

 that, the administrability problems with the 

government's rule come into sharp focus.

 And if I could turn to the Chief

 Justice's point earlier, what the government's 

rule would require people to do, ordinary 

people, not law librarians, is to dredge up 

decades-old drug schedules. They are not 

online.  The closest database we have is the 

ECFR, which is published by the National 

Archives.  It goes back only to January 2017. 

That's not going to do much good for anybody.

your -- some of your amici, the National 

Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers or the

response to that is that that is not what

 there was such a thing as electronic databases, 

before there were online digital sources. 

That's just not something that a Congress would

 have thought to do.

 And if you --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're -- you're 

making this argument, am I right, not as a 

matter of due process?  You're just saying it's 

a key to statutory interpretation? 

MR. ADLER: Correct.  And it also goes 

to the administrability of the government's rule 

because not only are ordinary people going to 

have to do this, but, yes, judges, probation 

officers, you know, lawyers are going to have to 

do this.  It is extremely difficult to do.

say to the -- your -- your friend's argument I'm

MR. ADLER: Sure, Your Honor.  So I

 MR. ADLER: Your Honor, I actually 

don't think so because, in a -- because, for a

 time-of-sentencing rule, you're going to have to

 look at not just the federal schedules from the

 time of offense but -- from the time of 

sentencing but also from the time of offense to 

make sure there's no ex post facto problem if 

substances are added in the intervening period. 

So our rule, it's a single contemporaneous

you must have had bigger cases than that.

 But let's say 20 kilos.  Somebody's

 arrested for 20 kilos of -- of cocaine.  Is 

there any realistic possibility that this is 20

 kilos of Ioflupane?

 MR. ADLER: Your Honor, the government 

has not made any sort of argument like that in

 this case.  This is a function of the

 categorical approach.  We're just asking the 

Court to faithfully apply that approach in this 

case as it always does in all of its cases. 

And if I can say one more thing about 

the Florida schedules, I want to be clear, that 

in July 2017, Florida de-scheduled this 

substance.  It followed the feds.  And so this 

is a time-limited rule. 

Moving forward, Florida convictions 

for cocaine postdating July '17 would not have 

the same overbreadth problem that we are 

identifying here.  And states routinely follow 

the federal government when they de-schedule 

substances.  So it's a time-limited rule.  And 

it's not going to knock out all Florida cocaine 

convictions or anything like that.

 MR. ADLER: It would not knock out

 Florida cocaine convictions post-dating July 

2017 because there would be no overbreadth that

 we are identifying.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, but all the ones

 before that are knocked out.  Should we consider 

-- should we put out -- put the categorical 

approach out of our mind in -- out of our minds 

in considering what Congress intended? 

MR. ADLER: I -- I'm not sure how the 

Court can -- can do that.  I mean, the Court has 

held that the categorical approach is a 

by-product of Congress's intent in the statute. 

It's held that for over 30 years.  So I'm not 

sure how the Court could put it out of its mind. 

And, of course, the government is not 

asking you to do anything like that.  There's 

been no dispute about how the categorical 

approach applies in this particular case at any 

stage of this litigation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if we -- if we 

believe that Congress must have had the 

categorical approach in mind because that's what

it would be that they would be two rules, that 

the federal predicates would operate with the 

old drug schedules and the state predicates 

would operate with the new drug schedules?

interpretation of (e)(2)(A)(i) for the reasons 

we explain in our brief.

the -- the federal provision is pretty clear

 that -- that there's no categorical approach 

going on and that it would be the old schedules.

 MR. ADLER: Sure.  So two points on

 that. The reason, as we explain on page 17 of 

our reply brief, one possible reason at least, 

is that when you are doing the federal analysis,

 it's easy to just look at the statute of

 conviction.  There's no notice problem.  There's 

no administrability problem.  You look at the 

judgment and say:  Was this person convicted 

under the CSA? Easy. 

You can't do that for state priors 

because there's -- you know, you can't enumerate 

all the state statutes.  So what Congress has 

done, it has looked to evolving federal drug 

schedules.  That was the only criteria -- that 

was the federal criteria they chose.  And as I 

was explaining before, it is incredibly 

difficult and problematic for notice purposes 

for people to have to go all the way back, 

decades earlier, to the time of their state 

offenses to identify the federal drug schedule. 

So that's one --

whether you were making the notice argument as a 

constitutional argument or, instead, just as a 

key to statutory intent, because it's not clear, 

right, that Congress in enacting statutes always

 wants to give the best notice possible to

 criminal defendants. 

MR. ADLER: That may be right, Your

 Honor. We're not making a full-throated due 

process violation argument. I think the canon 

of constitutional avoidance, though, may well 

come into this at some point if we're requiring 

ordinary people to go back decades and decades. 

And the second point I wanted to make 

on the (e)(2)(A)(i) point is the Court 

absolutely does not have to interpret that 

provision to resolve this case in our favor 

because the Court should simply say the exact 

same thing it said in Shular on page 786.  The 

Court unanimously said that the divergent text 

of the two definitions renders any divergence 

unremarkable, and that was quoting the 

government's own brief in that case. 

The exact same logic applies here. 

And, in fact, in Shular, we -- the only question 

was whether (e)(2)(A)(ii) referred to offenses

 (e)(2)(A)(i) referred to offenses.  And the 

Court still said we don't care, the text is

 different, it's referring to conduct in

 MR. ADLER: -- if you're using a

 time-of-offense rule that we are advocating 

here, then I think that's where the federal

 saving statute would come into play.  And so 

Congress would really have to speak clearly to 

overcome the presumption in the federal saving

 statute that we apply the penalties in effect at 

the time of the offense, and that is what this 

Court in Dorsey referred to as "an important 

background principle of interpretation." 

So I don't want to fight you too hard 

on that, but if we are operating under a 

time-of-offense rule, then, yes, that would --

you would not get the benefit of that.

offense, you know, okay, I can't possess a

 firearm.  922(g). Then you commit another

 serious drug offense.  Still 922(g).  Then you 

commit a and are convicted of a third serious 

drug offense that qualifies, and you know at 

that time, okay, I can't possess a firearm and 

I'm subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum if I

 do so.

 You have all the notice you want at 

that point even if there are later changes to

MR. ADLER: Your Honor, the notice is 

not applied at the time of the prior conviction. 

If it was, again, there would be an ex post 

facto problem for convictions that predate the

can't be right. 

But, practically too, people are not 

on notice at the time of their prior proceeding. 

They are not thinking about ACCA.  Their lawyers 

do not have to advise them about ACCA.  People 

are just dealing with the state case at that 

time. So to say that people have notice of ACCA

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So the thing I'm 

struggling with with your argument is that you 

say that we ordinarily apply the penalties in

understand.  But I guess, in the context of this 

exercise, I thought what the statute was 

requiring courts to do was to essentially 

classify or categorize a past offense. 

So the court is today trying to impose 

sentence, today trying to determine if 15 years 

should be added, and Congress directs them to do 

so by looking at this person's rap sheet and 

determining if there are "serious drug offenses" 

there.

understand why that classification is in any way 

related to the time of the ACCA offense. I get 

clearly Mr. Green's situation because he says 

you're doing that classification today, and so 

what counts as a serious drug offense should be 

made relative to what we would think is serious 

now by looking at the schedules now.

 And the government I get because they 

say: Well, when you're looking back at that 

offense, those offenses in the rap sheet, you 

should at least consider or it should be 

determined by what was serious then, right, what 

was on the schedule at that time. 

Your position, I'm trying to 

understand how it relates to the exercise of 

classifica -- classifying this as a serious drug 

offense. 

MR. ADLER: Thank you, Your Honor.  So 

let me try to explain it this way.  This Court 

has a long line of precedents about recidivist 

statutes, and they all say the same thing, that 

recidivist statutes punish the latest offense of 

conviction, which is here the 922(g) offense. 

The government, by the way, ignores this line of 

precedent.  Talking about Gryger versus Burke,

 And so our point is that you're not 

looking at someone's culpability at the time

 they commit the prior.  That -- the state court

 has already sentenced them based on that

 understanding of culpability.  You're sentencing 

them for what they have done at the time they 

commit the 922(g) offense.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But we're -- but 

it's not relevant to the exercise -- this --

this is an exercise that is embedded in a 

definition of "serious drug offense," which is,

 I think, what is the ultimate goal.  We're 

assessing whether or not these prior things were

 a serious drug offense. 

Your argument is just, you know, if we 

were sentencing without that sort of 

definitional overlay, then we would do so based 

on what happened with respect to the ACCA crime. 

But I guess I'm just confused about the 

definition of "serious drug offense" and how it 

has any bearing on your rationale. 

MR. ADLER: So, Your Honor, I don't 

think there's any question that the statutory 

penalties in ACCA are incurred the moment 

someone commits the crime.  That is the crime 

that we are punishing here, right?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN RAYNOR 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. RAYNOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

To determine whether a prior state 

conviction qualifies as a predicate under the 

Armed Career Criminal Act, courts should consult 

the federal drug schedules in effect at the time 

of that conviction.  That rule flows from the 

ACCA's text.  As this Court recognized in 

McNeill, the ACCA establishes a sentencing 

enhancement for defendants with previous 

convictions involving drugs listed on the

 federal schedules.

 That language dictates a

 backward-looking inquiry that requires courts to 

assess the attributes of a prior conviction at

 the time that it occurred.

 Critically, the ACCA treats both

 federal and state convictions as predicates. 

Under subclause 1, which unambiguously requires

 courts to consult the federal drug schedules in 

effect at the time of the prior conviction, 

there's no question about this.  Courts have to 

look to the past. 

The same rule should apply to 

subclause 2.  A -- a prior federal conviction 

would not disappear for ACCA purposes simply 

because the drug schedules were later amended to 

remove the relevant controlled substance.  And 

there's no reason to treat state crimes 

differently when they involve the same culpable 

conduct and the same regulated drug. 

Rather than engage with the statutory 

text, Petitioners rely exclusively on purported 

background rules of interpretation.  Jackson, 

most significantly, argues that courts should 

apply the federal criminal law in effect at the

 government agrees the version of the ACCA in

 conduct is what controls here.

 The question in this case is which 

version of the federal drug schedules the ACCA's

 cross-reference specifies, and Jackson's 

interpretive principle does not answer that

 question. 

Just as in McNeill this Court 

recognized that the ACCA points courts to the 

prior version of state law in effect at the time 

of the state conviction, so too it points courts 

to the version of the federal drug schedules in 

effect at that same time. 

This Court should affirm the judgments 

below. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  If we -- rather than 

looking at an underlying drug schedule, if the 

statute itself was amended, would your analysis 

be the same? 

MR. RAYNOR: No, Justice Thomas.  We 

acknowledge that if the ACCA included a static 

list of substances, so if appended to this 

provision there was just a list of substances,

piece of the schedules.  The question is simply

 which version of the schedule -- schedules.  And 

as the Court discussed in Jam --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I think -- I think

 the question, though, is normally when we have a

 cross-reference, we look at the contemporaneous

 version of the cross-reference.  I -- I think

 that's -- I think that's Mr. Jackson's primary

 argument.  And the -- and the statutory text 

here says "as defined in," which suggests we 

look at the present law, just as we normally 

would, just as you concede we -- a moment ago 

that we normally would. 

What -- what in the text suggests this 

backward-looking approach that you want to put 

into it? 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes, Justice Gorsuch. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In -- in the text. 

MR. RAYNOR: So, in the text, we think 

the cross-reference raises the temporal question 

and the context answers the temporal question. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  How? "As defined 

in." Those are --

MR. RAYNOR: Right.

only terms that we have to work with.

 MR. RAYNOR: So, as the Court

 explained in McNeill, I don't think the present 

tense does a lot of work here because this is a

 backward-looking statute.  I disagree that the 

background rule is that we always look to the

 contemporaneous referenced law.

 As the Court discussed in Jam, the

 reference canon actually supplies the background 

rule here, and the reference canon has temp --

different temporal branches depending on 

context.  The reason the reference canon is 

structured that way is because cross-references 

may refer to past law --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Of course. 

MR. RAYNOR: -- they may refer to the 

present law. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And, in fact, in 

(h), we have such a thing.  We don't here.  We 

just has -- we have "as defined in," not "as was 

once defined" or "as at the time of state 

conviction" or "as had been."  Lots of 

alternatives I can come up with that would 

accomplish exactly what you want and, in fact, 

appear elsewhere in the statute but not here.

MR. RAYNOR: I agree all of those

 formulations would answer the question 

dispositively. In our view, there's three 

aspects of the text that dictate a

 backward-looking inquiry.  There's the term

 "previous convictions," there's the term 

"involving," which we think refers to historical 

attributes of an offense, and, third, there is

 subclause 1, which unambiguously requires a 

backward-looking inquiry. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  For sure.  We ask 

backward-looking inquiry when we're saying do 

you have these things, these prior convictions. 

But, when we're asking what is a controlled --

what is a serious drug offense, that's defined, 

that's the section that we're now dealing with. 

So what do we -- what do we do with that? 

MR. RAYNOR: It -- it's true that 

subclause 1 is separate from this, but "previous 

convictions" is an umbrella term that informs 

the meaning of everything that follows. 

"Involving" is actually in the clause that's at 

issue here.  "Involving" is followed by a list 

of attributes of the prior state offense.  And 

"as defined in the federal schedules" is part of

 I think both of those textual pieces

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And just shifting

 gears, your -- your colleagues on the other side

 raised an ex post facto concern. What -- what

 is the government's analysis of that?  Is there

 an ex post facto concern?  If not, why not?

 MR. RAYNOR: We agree that there's an 

ex post facto problem with Mr. Brown's 

interpretation because anytime a drug is added 

to the schedules after the federal offense 

conduct --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, no, I'm -- I'm 

saying with respect to your interpretation.  If 

we accept the state offense time, there are 

going to be some drugs that will be added 

later --

MR. RAYNOR: Correct.

 And we're going to inevitably invite a 

number of ex post facto challenges, and I'm sure 

the government's given that thought, and I just 

want to know what you think the merits of that

 argument might be.

 MR. RAYNOR: We do not think there is

 any merit to that argument.  And I actually

 don't understand it -- them to be arguing that 

our position would create an ex post facto 

violation because we --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let's suppose I 

understand that to be their argument.  Then 

what? 

MR. RAYNOR: Then I -- I still 

disagree that there would be such a problem 

because we agree that the ACCA in effect at the 

time of the federal offense conduct governs.  Up 

until that point, the defendant can choose to 

possess a firearm or not to possess a firearm, 

so there's nothing retroactively being imposed 

on prior conduct. 

The prior convictions here are used to 

help ascertain the seriousness of the offense, 

how dangerous this defendant is, but,

ultimately, he's still being punished for the

 gun possession, which is the 922(g) violation.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well -- well, again, 

but the serious drug offense changes on -- on

 your view, it's -- we said it at the time of

 state conviction, but the schedules are dynamic, 

as you point out, and -- and it's going to lead 

some individuals to be punished under -- under 

your reading who would not otherwise be 

punished. 

And I guess I'm just trying to 

understand, again, do you think that's an ex

MR. RAYNOR: I think the only way that 

there would be an ex post facto problem is if 

they were being punished for additions to the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's what I'm

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's only -- it's

 only Brown's interpretation that would create an

 ex post facto problem.  Neither Jackson's nor 

yours would create any ex post facto issues as I

 understood it.

 Is that your understanding?

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Raynor, I'd like 

you to address the difficulty or, you know, the 

lack of access to the prior drug schedules,

your approach from an administrability point of 

view. 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes.  So, Justice 

Barrett, if we're talking about defendants, I 

think they paint this sort of artificial 

portrait that defendants at the time of their 

state convictions will be totally unaware of the 

federal schedule.  I think that ignores an 

important part of how the statute works. 

The statute picks up federal 

convictions and analogous state convictions.  So

 state convictions involving federally prohibited

 conduct, like manufacturing, distributing, or

 possessing with intent to do those things, a

 federally controlled substance.

 If you're a defendant who has

 trafficked in a federally controlled substance, 

you're going to be very interested in your 

federal exposure at the time even if you're

 being prosecuted by state authorities --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No, I understand 

that from a notice point of view, and, in fact, 

I think it would be more difficult for 

defendants who can't predict if the schedules 

are going to change later and not know whether 

their offense would be a predicate.  I -- I 

understand that. 

I'm just saying, at the time of 

sentencing for everyone, for the prosecutor, for 

the district judge, for the defendant who after 

the ACCA offense is committed has to figure out 

does this predicate count, how do you find the 

schedules?  You know, so --

MR. RAYNOR: I think part of it is you

 Ioflupane and hemp.  I think they're overstating

 the degree to which this will be a practical

 problem. 

But, to the extent you were worried

 about it, our position doesn't create any 

greater practical problems than McNeill already

 requires.  McNeill is going to require you to go

 back and look at the state code in effect at the 

time. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, the state code 

might be easier to find.  I mean, how often do 

the drug schedules change at the federal level? 

MR. RAYNOR: I -- Justice Barrett, I'm 

not sure that it will be easier to find because 

you won't just be able to look at the conviction 

documents, right?  To conduct the categorical 

inquiry, you're often going to have to pull old 

state drug schedules, which is going to be much 

harder to find than old federal drug schedules. 

You're also going to have to pull old 

versions of the state code to determine what the 

maximum applicable punishment was because the 

punishment to which you were sentenced might not 

answer the question.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Are the old federal 

drug schedules hard to find?

 MR. RAYNOR: It depends on what type

 of -- what -- what you're looking for. So, 

here, if we're talking about cocaine, cocaine

 has been scheduled since the beginning. If you 

look at the prior -- the modern definition of 

cocaine, there's an exemption for Ioflupane. 

You can discover that Ioflupane was de-scheduled 

in 2015 via a Google search.  So the -- the 

argument presented here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I --

MR. RAYNOR: -- is just not difficult 

to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming I accept 

that there's a burden -- I know you're saying 

there's not and the Chief suggested there might 

not be. I accept it because I think every 

prosecution, probation officer, and defense 

counsel in these various amicus tell us there's 

a problem. 

Who bears the burden of proving this 

at sentence?  I know that defense counsel says 

we have to figure it out because we have to 

advise our client.  But, at the end, they're

 enough to get the defendant off the hook.  I

 agree the government is going to have to bear 

the burden on this and prove it and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how would you 

want me to phrase that? It seems to me that if 

it's as difficult as is being suggested, if 

there is doubt, quantify how much doubt is

 enough to favor the defendant. 

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Sotomayor, as I 

said, the Sixth Amendment question is coming 

before the Court soon. I don't want to get out 

ahead of our briefing on that.  I do think that 

under Almendarez-Torres, this could be found 

along with the fact of the prior conviction. 

But I agree with you that this is something that 

the government must carry its burden on. 

And to get back to the burden question 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By a preponderance 

of the evidence on a legal question? 

MR. RAYNOR: No -- no, Justice 

Sotomayor.  I think it -- it's likely that it's 

beyond a reasonable doubt, but I'm not prepared

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just direct 

your attention to the kind of overall theory of

 this? Because I -- I'm, as usual, struggling

 with that.

 Do you concede that a change in the 

drug schedules reflects a change in what is

 considered to be a serious drug offense? In

 other words, to -- to -- to take a drug off the

 schedule, Congress has made a determination that 

that's no longer a controlled substance.  It's 

not going to be something that we consider to be 

a crime. 

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Jackson, I 

certainly agree that, going forward, that means 

someone can't be punished for that.  And a state 

conviction, going forward, also would not be 

treated as --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So then 

my question, I guess, is, why would Congress 

want to incapacitate defendants who have 

committed crimes that federal law no longer 

regards as serious?  I mean, I thought the point 

of this was we're doing ACCA because we think, 

Congress says, that certain people need to be 

taken off the streets for a -- long periods of

time, and in order to identify those people, we 

look at their histories and determine whether 

they have committed certain kinds of crimes.

 If we today, as we undertake 

sentencing, have an understanding that these 

certain kinds of prior crimes are no longer 

considered serious because the change -- the --

the schedules have changed, I guess I'm trying

 to understand why the government's position is 

that they should still be ACCA predicates. 

MR. RAYNOR: Right.  The reason, 

Justice Jackson, is because we think, in terms 

of assessing the seriousness of the prior 

offense, it makes sense to look at the legal 

landscape at the time that the offense occurred. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why?  We're doing 

the sentencing today --

MR. RAYNOR: Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- and we're trying 

to determine whether this person today needs to 

be put in jail for 15 more years.  So why does 

the seriousness or the label or the perception 

of the past as to what he did mattered?  Why 

wouldn't the criteria for determining that be 

what we think about his prior crimes today?

MR. RAYNOR: It -- it's relevant to

 his willingness to disregard the law. So, to 

take Jackson as an example, he trafficked

 cocaine in 1998 and 2004.  That was considered a

 very serious crime at the time.  The fact that

 there was later a medical use discovered for a

 derivative of cocaine --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. No, I 

understand how it turns into a technicality in 

the particulars of this case.  But what I'm 

saying is ACCA is not about punishing the person 

for the past offense.  He's already, you know, 

been held responsible, culpable, sentenced for 

the past offense. 

I thought it was about incapacitating 

people who we can identify as particularly 

dangerous based on the nature of their past 

offenses.  So it's not really about his 

willingness to -- to commit a crime.  I mean, he 

has these criminal offenses.  Congress would 

have just said, do you have an offense? 

Instead, they say, do you have a serious drug 

offense?

trying to get beyond is why we are evaluating

the seriousness of that offense based on past 

standards as opposed to the standards that would

 apply today as we're making this 15-year

 determination.

 MR. RAYNOR: Justice Jackson, I think 

another way to come at this is this is

 unambiguously what subclause 1 does.  It cares

 about the seriousness of the offense at the

 time. It cares about whether you had a federal 

conviction, even if --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, I -- I'm not 

so sure about that.  I mean, it doesn't -- it --

it too doesn't necessarily -- I'm trying to find 

the statute.  You know, it says an offense.  It 

doesn't say a conviction under the Controlled 

Substances Act.  And I appreciate that the 

previous thing says you have to have three 

previous convictions, right, but for a serious 

drug offense, and then it says an offense under 

the Controlled Substance Act. 

I mean, one could interpret that also 

with respect to modern standards because the 

exercise is trying to identify what is a serious

Substances Act, I suppose we could interpret the

 federal statute differently than what you're --

you're -- you're articulating, right?

 MR. RAYNOR: I don't think so, Justice

 Jackson.  I think the text says, do you have a 

previous conviction for an offense under the

 Controlled Substances Act?  If you have a 

conviction for an offense under the Controlled 

Substances Act, that's just the end of the 

analysis. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why -- why 

couldn't it be today's Controlled Substance --

that's what I'm asking you.  It would be -- it 

wouldn't be an offense for the Controlled 

Substances Act as it exists today. 

MR. RAYNOR: No, but it -- it would be 

literally a conviction under the Controlled 

Substances Act.  And, to be clear, it -- it -- I 

am not aware of any court entertaining this 

argument before, much less adopting it. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But it's also not at 

issue in this case, right?  We're doing the 

other thing.  We're doing --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- so your whole 

argument rests on treating differently a list of 

five substances or any other attribute of ACCA, 

treating it differently from a controlled 

substance as defined in Section 102.

 And that seems a little bit mysterious 

to me. I mean, if you ask why it is that 

Congress put in this language, "a controlled

 substance (as defined in Section 102)," it's, 

well, number one, there are lots of controlled 

substances, and you don't want to have to list 

all, however many there are.  And, number two, 

we expect them to change, so what's going to be 

a controlled substance next year is not 

necessarily the same as this year. 

And so, on both of those theories of 

why Congress used this language, it seems 

perplexing as to why you would have a different 

rule than you would if Congress had just listed 

the substances. 

MR. RAYNOR: Right.  Justice Kagan, I 

think one way to think about this is, if it had 

listed the substances, that would reflect a 

static concern with particular substances. But, 

by referencing an external body of law, Congress

evinced its concern with the drug's status under

 federal law.

 And for the reasons I was discussing 

with Justice Jackson, it makes a lot more sense 

to look at the drug's status under federal law 

at the time of the prior conviction.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, I would think

 quite the opposite, that what Congress is saying

 when it does -- when it uses this kind of 

language is we know this is going to be in flux, 

so keep on updating, you know? 

And -- and that's -- that's an 

argument in Mr. Adler's favor, not in yours. 

MR. RAYNOR: Right.  So, Justice 

Kagan, another way to come at this is that we 

think the cross-reference -- as I mentioned to 

Justice Gorsuch, it raises the temporal 

question.  When Congress puts in a 

cross-reference, we know from the reference 

canon there's multiple points in time it could 

be referencing.  There's no background rule that 

it's always referencing current law. 

So, in our view, the cross-reference, 

it only raises the question.  It doesn't answer 

the question.  We think what answers the

 "previous convictions," the term "involving,"

 and McNeill and this Court's precedent.  It's

 that text and context that in our view answers 

the question in favor of the prior state

 conviction ruling.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can -- can I ask 

about, following up on Justice Jackson's 

questions, how to think about this statute? 

Because I think about it not as a purely 

recidivist statute for recidivist drug offenses 

but -- but as a gun statute. 

Once you have the three prior offenses 

for serious drug offenses or a violent felony, 

you know, don't possess a firearm.  In fact, if 

you have one, you know don't possess a firearm. 

Once you have three, don't possess a firearm or 

you're getting a mandatory minimum because 

Congress was concerned about guns with drugs, 

not about drugs alone in this statute, about 

guns with drugs, and that's why you look --

that's what Congress was concerned about. 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes, Justice Kavanaugh. 

I think that's an important response.

 MR. RAYNOR: Right, exactly.  And I

 think that's an important response to their --

to their notice argument.  As -- as you

 mentioned earlier in your questioning of my 

friend, as soon as the defendant receives that 

third conviction, he's going to know he cannot

 possess a gun going forward.  That's not an 

inquiry for him to undertake 10 years later when 

he decides to --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Now the response 

to that -- so I want you to respond to what 

counsel said -- was not really, they don't 

really pay attention to that, they're not 

advised of that. So will you respond to that? 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes.  I -- I think 

there's two responses to that.  The first is 

what I just said to you.  It -- it inhibits 

their behavior going forward because they know 

one minute after that third conviction, if they 

possess a gun, they're subject to the ACCA 

enhancement.

earlier, which is this statute picks up federal

 convictions and analogous state convictions. 

And if you trafficked in a federally controlled 

substance, you're going to be highly aware at

 the time of what your federal exposure is, even 

if you end up being prosecuted under state law.

 So that's the second reason the defendants will 

care at the time.

 All of that being said, we think even 

if this is something that they researched later, 

the burden -- they'll have to do that research 

before possessing a firearm.  We don't think 

there's a problem even then, but we think the 

other side overstates the degree to which the 

defendant will be ignorant of federal schedules 

at the time of the state conviction.

response to Justice Kagan, talking about the 

reference canon, noted that sometimes it can 

refer to a past law rather than present law. 

But do you agree with the Court in Jam that a 

general reference to an external body of law 

takes that body of law as it evolves over time?

get to the level of specificity required to

 resolve this case.

 So every party in -- in -- in here at

 least --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let me just

 interrupt you there, I'm sorry.  "When a statute 

refers to a general subject, the statute adopts 

the law on that subject as it exists whenever a 

question under the statute arises." 

There's other language too.  I mean, I 

can -- the reference is to an external body of 

potentially evolving law.  So that's the general 

rule this Court has adopted. 

And -- and it's for you to overcome 

that general presumption, isn't it? 

MR. RAYNOR: I don't think so, Justice 

Gorsuch.  The Court actually articulated two

MR. RAYNOR: -- specific provision --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- can sometimes be

 fixed, sometimes, but generally, if there's 

reference to a general body of law, the rule is,

 always an exception, that -- that it takes it as

 it finds it.

 MR. RAYNOR: Yes.  I think on its face 

the canon here would suggest it's fixed because

 this is a specific reference.  All the parties 

agree that that is overcome here. 

I think, once the implication of the 

canon is overcome, the Court should just look to 

Congress's intent without further reference to 

the canon.  It should just ask, what did 

Congress intend here?  And for the textual 

reasons you and I discussed earlier. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  Okay. 

MR. RAYNOR: And I will say, even if 

you think that this falls within the dynamic 

prong of the reference canon --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

MR. RAYNOR: -- all of the parties 

agree that the schedules evolve and that this 

statute does not reference the schedules as they 

existed at the time of the ACCA's enactment.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's interesting.

 MR. RAYNOR: -- and I don't think -- I

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  So you -- you 

concede that it's dynamic too, but just it stops 

at a certain point?

 MR. RAYNOR: We concede it's not fixed 

at the time, correct.  I -- I don't concede that 

that branch of the canon necessarily applies, 

but, if you thought that it did, I don't think 

it supplies the requisite granularity to figure 

out which of the dynamic points that we're 

arguing about is correct. 

And this is evidenced by the fact that 

both Mr. Jackson and Mr. Brown claim that the 

reference canon supports their position even 

though they have different positions.

 to raise any argument you want.

 But it does suggest to me that there 

is a reading of this statute that comports with

 Mr. Jackson's approach.

 MR. RAYNOR: Justice Sotomayor, just

 to clarify, the -- the Brown briefs were filed 

at a time when this issue was just arising.  It

 was very much in flux. And the government 

offered the Third Circuit the saving statute 

approach as a narrow way to resolve the case 

because Mr. Brown would lose under either a 

time-of-federal-offense rule or a 

time-of-state-crime rule. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He only wins under 

his current rule, yeah. 

MR. RAYNOR: And -- and we -- we

brief reserves the time-of-state-crime rule for 

cases where it might matter.

Justice Barrett. I'm not sure about the answer.

 It -- it may be that we've had more major

 de-scheduling recently than we did in -- in the 

-- the first, you know, 20 or 30 years of the 

ACCA's existence, but, to my knowledge, this has 

really only started to arisen in the past two or

 three years.

 If I may for a moment just talk about

 Mr. Jackson's background rule.  He says courts 

always apply current federal criminal law at the 

time of the offense conduct. It's important to 

note that that rule doesn't exist in the 

abstract.  He draws it from three separate 

bodies of law. 

He -- he amalgamates it first from the 

Ex Post Facto Clause, which says that post 

offense changes that make the offense more 

culpable don't apply retroactively.  That rule 

obviously doesn't implicate our position here. 

Second, he -- he draws it from the 

saving statute, which says that post offense 

changes that make the conduct less culpable also 

don't apply retroactively.  Again, that sheds no 

light on our position here. 

And, third, he draws it from the

 logical point that if you commit an act that's 

not a crime at the time, you haven't committed a 

crime. So, if Congress passes a law that says

 you shall not murder, they repeal that law, and 

two days later you commit a murder, you simply

 have not violated any law. Again, that doesn't 

shed any light on our position here, which 

depends on ascertaining the seriousness of a

 predicate conviction. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, in -- in that 

situation, Congress repeals a federal statute, 

let's say we're looking at the federal prong and 

you commit federal crimes under the Controlled 

Substances Act at the time, and then Congress 

repeals that portion of the Controlled 

Substances Act. 

Is the government's position that it 

would still be ACCA -- ACCA predicate? 

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Jackson, if I'm 

understanding you correctly, if you were 

convicted of a CSA offense --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. 

MR. RAYNOR: -- Congress later 

repealed that aspect of the CSA, but it didn't 

make the change retroactive -- retroactive, so

To say that courts apply current

entirely question-begging.  It assumes the

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Now this seems to be

 in effect an amendment of ACCA.  So, if in 

effect it's an amendment of ACCA, why is it 

treated differently or less exactingly than an 

actual amendment of ACCA?

 MR. RAYNOR: Justice Thomas, we

 disagree that this -- this is equivalent to an

 amendment of ACCA.  We think the way to think 

about this is there's the text of the ACCA and 

then there's the external bodies of law that the 

ACCA requires courts to consult. 

And it's referring courts to external 

bodies of law because it cares about the legal 

landscape in existence at the time of the prior 

conviction.  The external bodies of law include 

both the schedules and state law. 

So just as in McNeill the Court said 

you have to look at state law at the time of the 

prior conviction, so too here.

Justice Thomas's question and not to belabor the

 g -- (e)(1) was exactly as it is, so all of your

 textual clues are exactly as they are.

 But, in (a)(1), instead of referencing

 the -- the schedules, it listed drugs.  You 

concede, I think, that despite all of your 

textual clues that you pointed to, that that

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Gorsuch, just to 

clarify, if in (a)(1) it listed drugs? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, if in (a)(1)

for the following substances:  cocaine, 

dah-dah-dah, not whatever the crazy drug is, you

if it listed those drugs, you -- I think you've

about incapacitating dangerous offenders.

 MR. RAYNOR: If Congress actually 

amended in the text of the ACCA a definition of

 burglary, we agree that definition would apply 

to federal offense conduct occurring thereafter.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And why is that?

 Why isn't that inconsistent with your argument 

that we should be applying the law at the time 

of the state offense? 

MR. RAYNOR: The reason, Justice 

Jackson, is we agree that what he's being 

punished for is his federal firearm offense. 

That's what this is punishing him for. But it's 

looking to prior convictions to ascertain his 

dangerousness, to ask: Is this the sort of 

person we really don't want possessing a gun? 

Is this a drug dealer who we really don't want 

possessing a gun? 

And in ascertaining the seriousness of 

the prior convictions, it makes sense to look to 

the legal landscape at the time and --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, no. I'm 

saying so we have a definition.  We have a 

definition of "serious drug offense," and the 

definition says manufacturing, distributing, or

 You seem to be saying that if Congress 

changed that definition to drop possession out,

 you would not consider or you would -- you would

 apply the new definition, right --

MR. RAYNOR: Correct.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- even if it 

previously included possession and it was a 

categorical match before, at the time of the 

state conviction.  I don't understand why the 

same argument doesn't apply to a change in 

controlled substance.  It's just another element 

of the definition.  Congress changes it, so why 

would you be saying that it has to be a 

categorical match only back at the time and not 

today? 

MR. RAYNOR: Right.  Justice Jackson, 

we agree that the statute of conviction, the 

ACCA, in effect at the time of the federal 

offense is the one that applies because, if you 

don't violate the version of the ACCA at the 

time of your federal offense conduct, you 

haven't violated the law. 

But the ACCA references external 

bodies of law. And so just as in McNeill the

The colloquies between Justice

in this case. I'd like to read you a quote from 

this Court's decision in Engel versus Davenport 

from 1926.  It's on page 8 of our reply brief, 

and it says that the "adoption of an earlier 

statute by reference 'makes it as much a part of 

the later act as though it had been incorporated 

at full length.'" That is exactly what ACCA is 

doing with the controlled substances schedules. 

There is no legal basis to say that

this case just because Congress incorporated

 them by reference.  But, as Mr. Raynor 

repeatedly said at the podium today, that is the

 government's position in this case.

 We submit there is simply no legal

 basis to draw that sort of distinction.  And we

 think that is simply the end of the case.  The

 government's remaining arguments based on

 McNeill, culpability, backward-looking, all of 

that prove too much because it would apply to 

all of the criteria in ACCA, burglary, 

possession, everything in ACCA, and the 

government agrees that cannot be right.  So --

so that argument fails too. 

I want to address briefly the 

reference canon because it came up a bunch.  I'm 

not sure why the government is referring to it 

because there's no dispute in this case that the 

reference canon, it's not -- the government's 

position is not even one of the options. 

There's two options.  There's 1986, which would 

be for static reference, which no one thinks 

applies here, and there's a dynamic general law, 

which is -- everyone agrees this is dynamic.

general referent is, when does the question

 arise under ACCA?  The question arises when the

 person commits the 922(g) offense.  That's it.

 Finally, I want to address notice to 

address Justice Kavanaugh's earlier concerns and 

-- and Justice Gorsuch's concerns about ex post

 facto. Our position on that is that if you

 think about a recidivist statute, a newly 

enacted one, let's say, it would have to apply 

to prior convictions that predated it. That's 

the whole point of the recidivist statute.  But, 

if you analyze notice at the time of the prior 

conviction, you couldn't do that.  It would 

violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in that 

situation. 

That's why ACCA covers pre-ACCA 

predicates.  Gryger versus Burke held that in 

the exact same situation.  And this is not 

something of the past. Congress revises 

recidivist statutes all the time.  It just did 

that in the First Step Act.  The NAFD brief 

talks about this. 

841 is the federal drug statute.  It

 felonies, serious violent felonies.  Those are

 brand-new terms.

 So, under the government's view of

 notice, those -- those terms don't -- that

 statute doesn't apply to any conviction that

 predates the First Step Act of December 2018?

that Congress could have intended that. 

We ask that the Court reverse the 

judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:28 a.m., the case 

was submitted.)
