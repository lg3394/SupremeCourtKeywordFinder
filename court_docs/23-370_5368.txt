 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-370,

 Erlinger versus United States.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Robust and clear precedent dictates 

the outcome here.  In case after case, this 

Court has held that judges applying ACCA may 

find only what crime with what -- what crime 

with what elements a defendant was previously 

convicted of, nothing more. 

And the Court has grounded that rule 

directly in the Sixth Amendment. A -- a judge 

may not increase a defendant's sentencing range 

based on offense-related conduct that the prior 

jury did not need to find. 

ACCA's occasions clause, as this Court 

construed it in Wooden, requires exactly that 

kind of factual inquiry.  The whole point of the 

clause, in fact, is to require something more

than just three convictions before an ACCA

 sentence is imposed.  As such, the Apprendi rule 

directly applies to it.

 That leaves amicus's objection that 

the Court should eschew that straightforward

 analysis because applying the Sixth Amendment

 here would somehow harm defendants.  But, as the

 briefs filed by criminal defense organizations 

show in this case, that concern is unfounded. 

Guilty pleas, waivers, and 

stipulations, in all candor, make the occasions 

clause not really an issue that's litigated in 

most cases.  But, in the rare cases, in fact, in 

the handful of cases a year where you're going 

to have a defendant who disputes the -- the 

occasions issue, as well as the underlying 

Section 922(g) charge, bifurcation is a 

time-honored solution that courts have already 

shown that they can apply to resolve that 

situation and avoid any prejudice to the 

defendant. 

The Court should endorse that practice 

and reverse the court of appeals. 

I'm happy to take the Court's 

questions.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Fisher, wouldn't

 it be more straightforward to overrule

 Almendarez-Torres?

 MR. FISHER: Obviously, that's one

 thing the Court could do if and when necessary,

 but I --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, do you think we

 should?

 MR. FISHER: I think the Court should 

someday, but I don't know the Court needs to do 

it in this case.  I think that -- our position 

in this case is what the Court has already said 

in Mathis and Descamps makes perfectly clear 

that the occasions clause falls outside of 

Almendarez-Torres, and I think, you know, the 

reason we didn't brief the case that way is 

because the Court's ordinary practice is not to 

consider overruling a case unless you had to. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But don't you have --

it -- it seems that you and the government can 

agree where you draw the line, right? 

MR. FISHER: I think, Justice Thomas, 

we agree on a whole lot.  So we agree that the 

test is whether or not it -- the fact at issue 

is part of the prior conviction. And the

 government uses the word "integral" to the prior

 conviction.  We think "inherent" in the prior

 conviction.

 So we agree with the test.  We do have 

some quibbles perhaps on the margins of how that 

test would apply, but, again, this case wouldn't 

present any of those issues.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well,

 Almendarez-Torres is a -- an established 

principle of -- an -- an established precedent 

of the Court that's been relied upon and 

reaffirmed in subsequent cases, so if we were to 

reexamine that, would it then be appropriate to 

reexamine the entire question that was opened up 

in Apprendi?  Or you -- would you just like us 

to open up the part that might yield a decision 

that's favorable to you? 

MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not even asking 

you to do that today, Justice Alito. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you --

MR. FISHER: But, if you -- but, if 

you did, I suppose fair is fair. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- you -- you sort of 

took -- you sort of took Justice Thomas's bait.

 MR. FISHER: -- I -- I -- I suppose 

fair would be fair and the Court could go back 

to first principles, and I think those first 

principles, as the Court -- as the Court's

 opinions in Apprendi showed, you know, would 

dictate the right to jury trial applies in -- to 

all facts necessary to include in --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that remains to 

be seen, but anyway, when you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --

I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  When -- when -- when 

you say that we should say something favorable 

about bifurcation, do you mean we should just 

say that it's a discretionary determination for 

trial judges, or you want us to hint more than 

that? 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think, as I 

understand the argument on the other side, it's 

that you should not apply the Sixth Amendment 

here because it would prejudice defendants. And 

so there's a ready answer to that question,

which is bifurcation.  It's the time-honored 

solution Justice Thomas identified in his 

Apprendi concurrence and we show in the papers 

has been endorsed by the Court in the past.

 I think the Spencer versus Texas case

 from nine -- from the '60s was one in which the 

Court, I think, gently endorsed bifurcation, and 

that was a state case. This is a federal case. 

And so I think the Court, if it wanted to, 

could -- could express a little more support for 

that. 

I'd -- frankly, I don't know what the 

argument would be against bifurcation, Justice 

Alito. As I said, there are only a handful of 

cases a year where this is even going to arise. 

There are fewer -- right now, there are fewer 

than 200 ACCA cases a year, and, of course, most 

of those are plea bargains. 

So there's only a handful of cases a 

year. And bifurcation occurs in things like 

criminal forfeiture, it occurs in all kinds of 

civil cases, and so just to move the fact 

finding from the judge over to the jury, I don't 

think it's very much to ask.

argument on the other side by the amicus is that 

the historical practice is much more mixed and

 that there were a variety of practices in the

 1800s and earlier --

MR. FISHER: Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- 1900s on this

 question and that recidivism, the question of

 whether a defendant committed prior offenses, 

was not routinely put before juries, in part 

because it was related to punishment and in part 

because it was perceived as different, because 

it's harmful to defendants in most cases to have 

it paraded before the jury. 

So that historical practice, I'm -- I 

think, because it's mixed, actually supports 

Almendarez-Torres and supports, arguably, the 

amicus says -- I want to get your response --

the -- what -- the approach that they're 

suggesting here, that Descamps and Mathis were 

statutory cases, not constitutional cases. 

Your response? 

MR. FISHER: Right.  So I think the 

history question is an important one, and then 

I'll turn to Descamps and Mathis.  And starting

when you get into it, it's a more mixed picture,

 I think.

 MR. FISHER: So, Justice Kavanaugh --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So those are two

 different questions.

 MR. FISHER: No, I think there's a lot

 there and we want to work through it. And --

and I will say, to cut to the chase, I think 

whatever test you apply on the history and 

tradition, we're going to win, but I think what 

the test is is -- is perhaps an important 

question for the future. 

And if you look at Gaudin, that's a 

Sixth Amendment jury trial case, and what the 

Court says is, to carve out an exception from 

the general rule that the jury has to find all 

the elements, the government in that case or the 

other side has to show an overwhelming history 

and tradition. 

And I think, once Apprendi extended 

the Gaudin all elements rule to any fact that 

increases a sentence and creates what the 

Apprendi Court itself called the general rule, 

subject only to the exception of 

Almendarez-Torres, then --

 know, whether you call it the rule or the 

exception kind of loads the dice, but the

 established principle in some states from --

from early on in our history was that these --

these issues were not put -- put before the 

jury. You can call that the exception or the 

rule. But recidivism was not put before the 

jury precisely because it's so harmful and is --

MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kavanaugh,

four out of, you know, whatever it was.

 MR. FISHER: Four out of -- by the

 time -- all the way into the 1920s --

MR. FISHER: -- four states.  And then 

I don't think that's enough to show any kind of 

meaningful history.  And, again, that's just on 

the Almendarez-Torres question, Justice 

Kavanaugh. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah. 

MR. FISHER: As to the different 

occasions type question that you have in front 

of you in this case, there is a sum and total of 

zero states up until 1929 that required any sort 

of finding like this that was allowed to be made 

by the -- by a judge instead of a jury. 

So what amicus has done is cobbled 

together four states that would just, you know, 

cut against overruling Almendarez-Torres and 

then a handful of other states with a few other 

kinds of findings here and there that are not 

offense-related conduct findings, which is what

 The, you know, amicus, I think the 

only other category of findings that amicus is 

really able to put much together on is the date

 of a prior conviction for -- for -- for --

for understanding that it's a prior conviction 

or a second conviction or that sort of thing. 

But, again, that has to do with the inherent

 nature of the conviction.  It's not anything to 

do with the offense-related conduct. 

And so that's what makes this an easy 

case. Whether you do it under Descamps and 

Mathis -- and I'll come to that in a minute 

because you asked me whether those are just 

statutory -- but the rule in those cases or just 

first principles, history and tradition, you 

land in the same spot. 

So let me turn to Descamps and Mathis 

-- Mathis then because you asked that as well. 

We think the Court, to use the Court's own words 

in Mathis, said what it meant in those cases, 

and the Court was very clear that one of the 

three reasons why the categorical approach was 

construed the way and -- and applied the way it 

was was because of the "serious Sixth Amendment

think, even went a step further in Mathis and

 expressed an unambiguous rule in Sixth Amendment 

terms that any facts beyond the elements of the 

prior offense that are related to the conduct of 

that prior offense have to be made by the jury

 and cannot be made by the judge. And that's 

stated unequivocally in Sixth Amendment terms in

 the Mathis opinion.

JUSTICE BARRETT: Mr. Fisher, can you 

maybe address what history and tradition are on 

your side?  Because Justice Kavanaugh's question 

said, oh, it will be loading -- loading the dice 

if you say that it's amicus's burden to show the 

history and tradition.  So can you talk about 

the history and tradition of fact finding by the 

jury in cases of recidivism that supports your 

side? 

MR. FISHER: Yeah.  So that's laid out 

quite thoroughly in our blue brief, that even 

when it came to a prior conviction itself, the 

overwhelming practice was for the jury to make 

those findings, and that's laid out quite 

thoroughly in our brief.  I don't think there's

a dispute that that was the common law rule.

 And -- and any other fact that amicus

 identifies, the answer is the same.

 And, Justice Barrett, I think

 something else that's important to understand is 

that the occasions inquiry in this case, you

 know, arose from some 1960s reform movements

 about recidivism statutes, so there is no direct

 analogue from history because this is a 

innovation of the '60s and beyond.  And so --

and so it's really amicus that would depart from 

history by letting this fact be found by the --

the judge instead of the jury. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  One other question. 

Do you agree with the government amicus that the 

harmless error analysis would apply? 

MR. FISHER: Yes.  I think Neder --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I thought that. 

MR. FISHER: -- dictates that harmless 

error would apply in these cases, and so I think 

there's -- this case would be one of some 

pipeline cases that would be decided by lower 

courts on a harmless error. 

Obviously, once you establish this 

rule, I don't think that's going to be much of

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, please go ahead.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. I just wanted 

to know, if there is a history and tradition of 

fact finding by the jury with respect to 

recidivism, which I understood your answer to 

Justice Barrett to be that that's the case, how 

-- what is the basis then for the 

Almendarez-Torres carveout?  Like, why do we 

have that? 

MR. FISHER: I think for two reasons 

as I understand the Court's jurisprudence.  One 

is, in Almendarez-Torres, the Court did talk 

about a tradition of judicial fact finding when 

it came to prior convictions.  The problem, I 

think, is that it's a more recent tradition. 

It's not the kind of tradition the Court 

typically looks to nowadays, but there was a 

recent tradition of judicial fact finding. 

And, secondly, the Court explained in 

Apprendi that at least when it comes to the fact 

of a prior conviction, which is to say the 

elements in -- and nothing more, you have prior 

procedural protections in the form of a jury

 It's a multi-factor question.

 MR. FISHER: I think the jury

 instruction --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Have you given any --

could you give us a model jury instruction on 

this or do you have some idea how -- how a jury

 could grapple with this question?

 MR. FISHER: I think those exist, 

Justice Alito, and they just mostly track the 

language in the Court's opinion. So the 

question for the jury overall, of course, is 

whether these prior offenses were committed on 

different occasions, which, as the Court put it 

in that case, turns on whether it was a single 

criminal episode or not, and then there are the 

factors, temporal proximity, geographic 

proximity, and the nature and relationship to 

the offense. 

I think it's similar to other kinds of 

qualitative elements that juries sometimes find. 

Mens rea can sometimes be highly qualitative. 

Materiality in a fraud case can be -- can be 

multi-factored in certain ways.  So --

 multi--- that's not a multi-factor

 determination.  Mens rea, you're -- you're 

asking the jury to determine what is in the

 defendant's mind.  People make judgments about 

what is in the mind of other people all the

 time. That's a -- that's a common experience.

think of something offhand -- maybe you can --

that's -- that's quite as multi-dimensional and 

nuanced as this. 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think maybe one 

way to think about it, Justice Alito, is you 

have -- you have a top-line finding that needs 

to be made, which is different occasions or a 

single criminal episode, and then you have 

subsidiary facts that feed into that ultimate 

finding. 

And that's just -- you know, that's 

like most of the things, I think, we were just 

talking about, which is a top-line finding and 

then subsidiary facts.  And just so you have an 

opinion in Wooden itself that makes -- you know, 

kind of lays out those various facts, and so the

temporal factor, I don't want to dwell too much 

on this, but it -- it would -- it will turn out

 to be important if you prevail.  Temporal

 proximity is important.  And so then the jury

 says: Well, what does that mean?  They were --

they had to occur on different days, different 

weeks? And what's the judge supposed to say? 

MR. FISHER: I don't think --

something like, the ultimate question you're 

asking is whether this is a single criminal 

episode or not when you come -- when you

a single coherent, you know, plan or experience

 or event.  We -- we --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Like a whole RICO 

enterprise.  That's a single criminal episode? 

MR. FISHER: I don't think so.  I 

think there's, you know, temporal -- I think 

there are limits temporally, but I don't think 

-- as the Court itself went back and forth at 

the oral argument in Wooden, I don't think it's 

necessarily a single day or a single -- single 

place. I think the qualitative nature of a 

single episode allows for a little bit more than 

that.

episode, especially against the backdrop of what 

ACCA is trying to accomplish with the different

 occasions clause.

 What -- remember, what you're trying 

to accomplish is identifying career offenders, 

people who have a long practice of offending.

 And so somebody who goes on a single bender or 

executes a single plan is not the kind of person 

that ACCA seems to be trying to identify.

and does it matter, the exact scope for this 

case? 

MR. FISHER: It doesn't matter, the 

exact scope for this case, because all the Court 

has to do is apply the rule that's announced in 

Descamps and Mathis, which is any 

offense-related conduct that goes beyond the 

elements is covered by Apprendi, not 

Almendarez-Torres. That's enough to decide this

 So, Justice Kagan, there are a few

 other facts.  Candidly, there are not very many 

cases about them because there aren't very many 

recidivist statutes that deal with something 

like the date of the offense or other kinds of

 facts that are about -- I'm not going to say 

never, but there is very little case law on it.

 And something like, you know, these 

other kind of facts are -- are, again, rarely 

going to be litigated because the defendant may 

not have any legitimate argument when it comes 

to, you know, these other kind of facts.

remand, not that we need to address it but just 

to pick your brain for a minute. 

MR. FISHER: Yeah. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Our line between

what is structural error, I confess, sometimes 

defies me. On the one hand, it's structural

 of counsel.  On the other hand, it's susceptible 

to harmless error review if you didn't instruct

 the jury with respect to an element of the crime

 or if there's a variance.

 MR. FISHER: Right.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Here, we have the

 plea bargaining context, so we don't even have a

 trial record to analyze for harmless error 

review.  So I'm -- I'm a bit uncertain how one 

would do harmless error review, other than look 

at the very records that you want to be able to 

challenge before a jury, right? 

You -- you -- you may be taking 

judicial notice that he did it on such and such 

a date and he did this in -- in a certain place. 

MR. FISHER: Right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  How does that work? 

How do you do harmless error review when you 

don't have a trial record?  And -- let me add 

one more thing in there, a lot, I know -- here, 

your client pleaded to an information that 

listed as the ACCA predicate offense different 

crimes, so he didn't even have notice that the 

government was going to reach back to when he

 burglaries to enhance his sentence by 15 years. 

And he's now in his mid 40s so that he'll never 

-- he won't get out of prison until he's in his

 And how -- how do we analyze, oh, it 

was harmless that he didn't even know what he 

was pleading guilty to?

 MR. FISHER: I think you're right 

there are challenges even with conducting a 

Neder-type harmless error analysis after a jury 

verdict.  Justice Scalia pointed out in dissent 

in that case that becomes a very difficult 

speculative enterprise. Of course, the majority 

of the Court disagreed.  And the Court has also 

disagreed when it comes to indictments. 

So I don't want to butt myself up too 

hard against the Court's precedent, but I do 

think you make a good point that when it comes 

to cases where you have plea bargains, the 

question whether a jury might have found 

something or not requires, a -- you know, a very 

unusual showing on the government's part that 

it's absolutely so clear based on the kind of 

documents that we all agree a court can look at

 systems.  Our holding here will cause states to 

have to revamp their recidivism practices, so 

that strikes me as something we didn't even

 contemplate in Mathis and Descamps.

 You're saying, I think, they're fueled

 by constitutional concerns.  But they didn't

 actually -- amicus makes this point -- address 

the constitutional question, correct? 

MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I think they 

did address the constitutional question.  I 

grant you they also, you know, grounded the case 

in statutory analysis.  But, as to the effect on 

the states, there are a handful of states only 

that have anything like a different occasions 

kind of finding.  Obviously, if you overruled 

Almendarez-Torres, that would have a bigger 

effect on the states. 

But you have only a hand -- a small 

handful of states that have a finding anything 

like this, Justice Kavanaugh, and that's, I -- I 

would just submit, quite small potatoes compared 

to what the Court has done in other Apprendi 

cases, you know, and required the states to do 

in reaction.  And I think it's probably telling

the prevalence of plea bargaining that goes on, 

that having this as an element of the offense 

will actually be problematic for criminal 

defendants? 

I know you have the amicus briefs on 

the other side, but I just want you, since it's 

MR. FISHER: Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- raised by 

amicus here, to respond to that. 

MR. FISHER: Right.  I think the NAFD 

brief actually deals with the plea bargaining 

dynamics that follow from a holding in our favor 

here, and they're actually good, because the 

problem with felon-in-possession cases where 

ACCA is a -- is a -- is a -- is a kicker on the 

back end is that there's nothing to plead to

 because the -- before Wooden and hopefully this

 case, you know, the -- the probation officer

 could just tell the judge you have to increase 

the sentence, the defendant had no fair notice

 and -- and -- and no way to defend, no -- no way 

-- nothing to bargain with, is -- is what I mean

 to say.

 And so, if you look at actually

 statistics, 14 percent of felon-in-possession 

cases go to trial.  That's a very high number 

for the federal system.  Here, if you were to 

say that the different occasions clause is an 

element, that then puts prosecutorial discretion 

in the government's hands and gives the 

defendant something to bargain with the 

government with.  So you can have in the future 

defendants who plead guilty to the underlying 

922(g) charge who would not have done so in the 

past in exchange for taking the ACCA enhancement 

off the table. 

And one last thing about that. 

Remember, at the time this case was litigated, 

the -- the maximum punishment for 922(g) was 10 

years. Now it's 15 years.  So those -- that 

actual change in law and the dynamics that would

 particular facts.

 So there's offense -- the -- the date 

of the offense, I think, is something the

 Solicitor General suggests might be within the

 prior conviction exception.  We don't think it 

is because the date of the offense is not an 

element of the crime. It's not something a

 prior jury would have had to find.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Does that suggest 

that the -- the sort of future work of this 

Court and other courts is going to be to have to 

identify which facts go to the judge and go to 

the jury?  I mean, are -- are we at that level? 

It seems at least the other side has a sort of 

simpler conception of this, which is recidivism, 

put it in the bucket of Almendarez-Torres. 

MR. FISHER: Well, it might be simpler 

to say any fact about a prior conviction, using 

a gun, vulnerable victim, whatever you could 

imagine, would be called within recidivism.  I 

just think that's so at odds with the Court's 

Apprendi jurisprudence that that option is just 

not on the table as a matter of stare decisis. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, let me ask you 

another question about that option --

MR. FISHER: Yeah.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- which is it seems 

very complex. This is going back to Justice

 Alito's line of questions.  I -- I totally 

understand your point, I understand the

 precedents, but we do have this

 Almendarez-Torres carveout, and part of this

 case is -- is understanding its scope and 

whether or not this kind of thing should fit --

does fit in it as a matter of precedent or 

should fit in it given all of the various ways 

in which this could go. 

And one concern I have is that I 

think, when we're talking about two different 

sets of facts with respect to the jury, there 

is, like, added complexity.  What I mean by that 

is we have the facts that relate to the charged 

crime, today's charged crime in this case, it's 

the 924(g), but we also have facts that relate 

to past crimes that this defendant was convict 

-- convicted of committing, and I guess I'm just 

trying to understand how today's jury 

adjudicates past crime facts. 

So are they limited to the record that 

was presented to the original jury on those

crimes that happened 20 years ago as we try to 

figure out whether they happened on a -- a 

single occasion, or how does this work?

 MR. FISHER: So, remember, if you 

bifurcate, the jury's not doing the two things

 at the same time.  They're doing the -- they're

 doing the 922(g).

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. 

MR. FISHER: And then -- and then 

they're having a separate proceeding. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. 

MR. FISHER: In that separate 

proceeding, I do think other evidence could come 

in beyond the -- beyond the record that was 

established in the initial conviction because 

the way I think Congress drafted this, was 

committed on separate occasions, is an 

open-ended fact finding.

we keep this from being just like many retrials

impossible, but this is my answer to Justice 

Kagan. There are very few states that have or 

-- or in the federal code that have facts beyond 

the prior conviction itself that trigger 

enhancements that are -- that are currently in 

the law found by judges.  So I think it's very 

uncommon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON

 BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

As I think the colloquy so far this 

morning has demonstrated, as -- as we see it, 

this case boils down to an unavoidable 

syllogism, which is that under Wooden, the 

different occasions finding under the ACCA 

requires a multi-factored inquiry involving the 

timing, the proximity of location, and the 

character and relationship of prior offenses, 

whereas the Sixth Amendment prohibits, to use 

the words in Mathis, exploring the manner in 

which a prior conviction's offense occurred.

And we therefore think that because a 

district judge is disempowered from doing it, 

the only option left is that the jury has to do 

it, and so we have acknowledged that a -- a jury

 would need to do that.

MR. FEIGIN: And as you might 

anticipate, your suspicion might have been my 

answer is no, and the reason why is that we

correct, but it's also a precedent this Court 

has adhered to for 25 years post-Apprendi, 

always acknowledging this. 

Nobody's asked the Court to overrule 

it in this case. There's no need for the Court

just leave it the way it is.

 To address some of the questioning 

from Justice Jackson and I think maybe Justice

 Kagan, we don't think very many

 Almendarez-Torres questions are really going to

 come up in practice.  We do think that it means 

a bit more than I think my friend thinks it 

means, but our principal interest here is

 actually in the type of cases that are currently 

before the Court in the Brown and Jackson cases, 

which involve the comparison of state predicates 

to federal predicates and some timing questions 

that come up with those. 

And that situation's already covered 

by McNeill. It's clear that a court can find 

what version of the statute was applied to the 

defendant at the time of the prior conviction, 

so --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you want to say 

why you think Almendarez-Torres is correct? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I -- I 

don't really want to turn this into relitigation 

of Almendarez-Torres, which, again, even 

Petitioner has not asked for, but we think the 

Court was correct.  There are more states that I

 There are -- there's some clear

 precedent from Alabama, Louisiana, South

 Carolina, and Kansas.  There are the superseding 

indictment statutes out of Virginia, West

 Virginia, Maine, and Massachusetts.

 And although some of those statutes 

allowed for jury trials on the back end, the --

that was all historical evidence that was in 

front of the Court in Almendarez-Torres, and the 

Court found that -- and this goes to some of 

your earlier questioning, Justice Kavanaugh --

that there was at least enough non-uniformity on 

the issue to allow legislatures some wiggle room 

on this topic, which, again, Almendarez --

 thought you might. I think, as we view it, the 

Court made a move in Apprendi that I think your 

colloquy with Mr. Fisher illustrated, the Court 

made a move in Apprendi to extend the Sixth 

Amendment's treatment of things as an element to 

various features of criminal statutes that the 

legislature intended as sentencing factors.

 And I think we would take the view

 that that -- viewing that as somewhat of an 

extension of what the Sixth Amendment literally 

demands, that there wouldn't be any burden on us 

to show unanimous or near unanimous practice. 

So long as, as we think the history indicates, 

this was left to the legislature to describe, we 

think the legislature would retain that room 

today. 

But, again, the Court doesn't need to 

get into any of this today.  It is clear from 

the historical practice that there's really 

nothing like this.  At most, the amicus marshals 

some decisions that show beyond simply 

reaffirming the correctness of 

Almendarez-Torres, that show that district 

courts or trial courts could conduct some sort 

of sequencing determination, which we think a

court can do because it can find the time of the

 prior offense, but, at the very least, can find

 the time of the prior conviction.

 And even those cases are relatively

 modern.  There is -- only South Carolina so far 

as we can tell under a 1955 statute and a 1972 

decision has allowed for litigation in front of 

a judge of the type of thing that the different

 occasions inquiry of ACCA might encompass. 

And we're talking about, you know, 

precise timing questions.  So a court, we think, 

on its own could determine that on or -- the 

jury necessarily found that an event occurred on 

or about April 7th, for example. But the kind 

of timing questions that are involved under the 

ACCA's different occasions inquiry are going to 

be more fine-grained than that. 

You could have acts occurring across a 

single day that are separate occasions.  Sells 

drugs in the morning.  In the afternoon, robs a 

store. In the evening, comes home and beats his 

spouse.  Like, those would be three separate 

occasions.  There's clearly a chance to have a 

break in between those.

that's already clear to some degree from Wooden,

 which I take to generally say that if you've got 

offenses spaced as far apart as these are, that 

it's almost invariably going to be the case that 

they are on separate occasions.

 But, if the Court wishes to explain

 that, that -- that would be great for us. In --

in particular -- or great by us. For us as

 well. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FEIGIN: In particular, to -- just 

to address the harmless error argument that Mr. 

Fisher posited a few minutes ago, we don't think 

simply "I was in debt" is enough to make things 

the same occasion.  The -- the kinds of 

circumstances where possibly a jury could -- you 

know, we -- we think, you know, it would be fair 

to find -- obviously, this always goes to the 

jury, but we think would really be realistically 

found to be the same occasion if they occur 

across the course of several days might be what 

the Court posited in Wooden itself, like they're 

part of a common criminal scheme.

 course of the kidnapping, and later you murder

 the victim.  It's possible that, you know, a 

jury could find that those were all the same

this case.  That's an admirable step of candor. 

But, on the -- on the -- on this 

harmless error question, let me ask you first, 

how is a court supposed to conduct that when 

there hasn't been a trial and in a world in 

which almost everybody pleads guilty these days? 

A -- a really novel development during the 

course of our lifetimes. 

So, here, the defendant was told that 

the three predicate ACCA crimes were different 

than these three crimes that you're now asking 

us to -- to -- to -- for a court to say are 

clearly separate occasions and -- and, 

therefore, harmless error.

was 18 that have nothing to do with his 

possession of a firearm today as a 

40-something-year-old man. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, first 

of all, I don't think he was under any 

assurances that he would not receive an ACCA 

sentence.  In fact, he was --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, but in the 

information, the government specifically listed 

three other predicate offenses, not these. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I'd --

to the extent you're suggesting that the 

availability of an ACCA sentence might have 

informed his decision to plead, he was perfectly 

on notice that he could receive an ACCA 

sentence.

It turns out that it's for three -- or 

I think only two of the crimes are different 

than the original ones because of intervening 

decisional law that made some of the original

 charged predicates no longer valid.

 To -- to be clear, we don't think that 

in the indictment we actually need to charge 

what the specific predicates are.

 MR. FEIGIN: It -- it put him on 

notice of the ACCA, but it was also in support

knowing --

 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, now 

that we've expanded the different occasions 

inquiry into a fundamentally factual one --

 that's the holding of -- of Wooden -- I think 

looking at what the defendant precisely did, it 

doesn't remotely support an argument of that

 sort.

 And also, the idea that I -- I -- I --

I would resist the idea that it's part of a 

common scheme or plan simply just to undertake a 

string of robberies within a week.  Like, 

clearly, he had the means to do the first one, 

to do the second one, and to do the third one. 

He had several days in between to cool off. He 

-- he did not -- and on the last day, he robbed 

two stores, Druthers and Schnitzelbank.  The --

if you want to look at the sentencing 

memorandum, the government's sentencing 

memorandum, at page 6, those are fairly far 

apart from one another. 

I don't really think he has any viable 

argument, and I don't take debt, simply a debt, 

to be an argument.  Otherwise, a -- a gambling 

addict could constantly be on the same occasion.

 You think all of that is admissible?

 MR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor.  I mean,

 there are -- for example, in -- in addition to 

the hearsay exceptions that might cover those, I

 think, to the extent you're submitting documents 

that were just shown to the jury that are being 

used for the purpose of showing what the jury 

was instructed as opposed to for the truth of 

the matter asserted, there isn't a hearsay 

problem with those. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now suppose the rule

Wooden was that judges have usually regarded 

things that are separated by more than a day as 

having occurred on separate occasions.  I don't 

know whether you can instruct a jury about what 

judges previously did, but put that aside. 

Suppose there's a rule that says that, 

in general, offenses that are separated by a day 

or more are -- occur on different occasions.

document for one says on or about March 27th. 

The other one says on or about March the 30th.

 Is that sufficient to prove beyond a

 reasonable doubt that they occurred within a

 day? If it's not, then what are you going to 

do? You're going to have to call the witnesses 

from those prior trials, if they can be found, 

and nail down the exact day on which this

MR. FEIGIN: Well, to answer your

could -- that would be enough to support a 

jury's inference beyond a reasonable doubt that 

they are on different occasions, particularly if 

there are other aspects of the crimes that are 

different. 

But, number two, if we can't otherwise 

establish that -- and, again, this is an inquiry

documents as to which they didn't really differ

conclusions.  So it will be even easier for a

 particularly if there is really no contrary

 argument that connects them. 

And, you know, if necessary -- and one 

-- one reason we don't really think that 

Almendarez-Torres should be overruled as a 

practical matter is we don't really want to have 

to get the victims back into court to testify 

about what happened or the exact day on which it 

happened. 

But I -- I -- I don't take this to be 

a particularly complicated inquiry.  It's a 

common-sense one. Wooden expressly explained it 

as such. And we've had, due to the uniformity 

of the circuits against the position we're 

conceding now, very few actual jury trials, but 

we've had four of them, and it hasn't proven to 

really be a -- a problem for us.

question about differences in the nature of the

 offenses?  So, if the offenses are sufficiently 

different, that may support the conclusion that

 they were not part of -- they were not committed

 on the same occasion, they're not part of the

 same scheme.  What's the judge supposed to tell 

the jury about that?

 Suppose you have a case where the

 defendant committed a -- a robbery in the 

morning on one day by grabbing a woman's purse 

and running away with it. Then, in the evening, 

the defendant committed another mugging using a 

knife and then the following morning went into 

some retail establishment and just grabbed $500 

worth of merchandise and ran away. 

Are -- are they sufficiently 

different? 

MR. FEIGIN: Yes, I -- I think they 

are.

 It's clear, and the Court was

 explaining this in Wooden, that what Congress 

was trying to do was to address the situation in

 the Petty case out of the Eighth Circuit where 

the government and the solicitor general had

 confessed error where essentially he got all of 

the occasions out of one act.

 Where you have the three kinds of acts 

even over a -- a short span of time such as 

you've described, Justice Alito, I think that's 

presumptively going to be separate occasions, 

not that you'd instruct the jury with such a 

presumption, but that it would be presumption in 

the sense that the jury would -- I would expect 

the jury to find those to be separate occasions, 

unless the defendant produced some substantial 

evidence to convince the jury otherwise.

then there was, after that, separate jury 

consideration of the enhancement, where we

 introduced evidence about the prior crimes, had 

argument about the prior crimes, and the jury --

the -- those questions were submitted to the

 jury.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I guess what I'm

 asking is there's been some talk about how

 difficult this is going to be for everybody. 

Was it? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, let me say two 

things about that, Your Honor. I mean, one is 

this obviously was not our first-choice 

position.  We have been arguing to the contrary 

for a long time.  Our position in Wooden was 

largely informed by the fact that if it was a 

judge inquiry, that it needed to be a much 

simpler inquiry.  And this is not -- this is 

imposing some burden on us. 

But number two is that it -- it's 

manageable, and we believe it will be 

manageable.  Obviously, because of the 

uniformity of the circuits, it's a little bit 

hard to predict that.  But this is -- ACCA cases 

are less than 1 percent of the federal criminal

confession of error, I guess I thought of it a 

little differently than Justice Gorsuch did, 

because not one way or the other, but all the 

courts of appeals have rejected the confession 

of error, right, and ruled still for the

 government's original position? 

MR. FEIGIN: That's true, Your Honor, 

but we don't think that those holdings are

 viable.  I mean, some -- in some cases, they've 

just been waiting for this Court to itself 

announce that the syllogism I mentioned at the 

beginning is correct, because the Court 

expressly reserved the question in Wooden. 

In some cases, we think they're just 

reading the Almendarez-Torres exception too far, 

and in other cases, they're talking about 

prejudice to the defendant, which, first of all, 

we don't -- we think is itself a manageable 

problem, but also, as Mr. Fisher said, if -- if 

you don't believe me, you -- you can believe the

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Feigin, just a

 quick clarifying question.  When you were going 

back and forth with Justice Alito about how this

 would actually be done as a practical matter, he 

was asking you about burden of proof, and I

 don't think you ever went back to it.

 I mean, in the old system, when judges 

were doing this, it was by a preponderance, I 

assume? 

MR. FEIGIN: Correct. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  The sentencing?  So 

do you anticipate, which I took to be the thrust 

of some of Justice Alito's questions, that when 

juries are doing this beyond a reasonable doubt, 

do you think that the problems of proof would 

make it much more difficult to prove the 

predicates? 

MR. FEIGIN: I think that it will do 

two things.  It may well do two things.  And, 

again, for reasons I've stated, this is kind of 

predictive. 

I -- I do think it may incentivize 

defendants to submit this to a jury whereas they 

might not have before, and I don't know that

that's necessarily a -- a particularly

 beneficial thing as a practical matter because I

 think very rarely would it actually be the case

 that these were not -- that the defendant's

 three prior offenses were not committed on

 separate occasions.

 And, second, going before the jury, we

 might need to introduce different types of proof 

or it may be harder to acquire everything that 

we might need. We'd prefer, as I said, not to

brain, you know, October 26th, that's a day I'll 

never forget because that's the day that that 

man robbed me, particularly if it's 10 years in 

the past and memories may have faded. 

In fact, this kind of inquiry or --

and much more overruling Almendarez-Torres would 

be a windfall for defendants who have a long rap 

sheet, as Mr. Erlinger does here, but who 

several of their crimes have been knocked out by 

various of this Court's or the court of appeals' 

decisions, and so we have to rely on some of the

 produce this evidence or even to find every 

single state record that we might need, where 

there would otherwise be no dispute about it

actually committed those offenses and what they

 were about.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  One other question. 

So Justice Kagan asked you about the four trials 

the government has already conducted that were 

bifurcated.  Same jury or did you -- was it a 

different jury? 

MR. FEIGIN: I believe it was the same 

jury, Your Honor.  I -- I -- I -- I'm not -- I'm 

not certain, but I don't see any reason why 

you'd need to swear in an entirely new jury and 

say, hello, here's the defendant, you know, 

here's what we've already determined. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure.  Thanks. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I just want to 

clarify one thing because I've seen cases in

 "on or about" X date.  In some of them, those

 counts even have overlapping dates and, you

 know, time frames.  And so I -- I guess I would 

expect that it would be those kinds of cases in

 which the defendant would have a colorable 

argument that these things happened on the same

 occasion, and those would be the ones that would 

be more likely to go to trial, right? 

I mean, it -- it's -- I guess I'm --

I'm suggesting that the trial scenario seems to 

me to be precisely the one where you would have 

to bring in all the evidence related to the past 

crime because, if it was just as easy as, you 

know, these things are on separate dates, the 

person probably wouldn't go to trial, right?

do think that -- again, we don't have a ton of 

experience with this.

 we haven't really had to use very often because

bother the government that you could have a jury

tend to reach that conclusion.

COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF

 THE JUDGMENT BELOW 

MR. HARPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

ACCA's occasions clause requires 

judges to make a classic recidivism 

determination, a finding about the separateness 

of prior offenses.  Under this Court's 

precedents, that legislative choice is 

consistent with the Constitution.  This Court 

held in Almendarez-Torres, based on 

centuries-old sentencing practices, that judges 

can impose sentencing enhancements based on 

recidivism. 

For decades, the federal courts of 

appeals have unanimously applied

 Almendarez-Torres to uphold judicial fact 

finding under the occasions clause, and states

 also have relied on Almendarez-Torres to enact 

and enforce similar state recidivism schemes.

 Petitioner and the government seek to 

upend this practice, but they don't offer a 

principled basis for doing so. Their front-line 

position is that judges can find only the

 elements of prior offenses.  But they concede 

that Almendarez-Torres authorizes judges to find 

various non-elemental facts as well. So they're 

forced to make exception after exception to 

their elements-only principle, and they 

ultimately land on standards that are 

inconsistent with one another and divorced from 

any constitutional principle or precedent of 

this Court. 

I think what this Court's precedents 

show is that judges can find facts about prior 

offenses under Almendarez-Torres, whereas juries 

must find facts about present offenses under 

Apprendi. 

But, even if the other side's 

approaches were correct, the Court should still 

affirm because at least the government agrees

that judges applying ACCA's predicate felony

 clause can find facts about the dates and

 locations of prior offenses, and those very same

 facts are going to resolve most occasions

 questions, as this case illustrates.  It would

 make no sense to allow judges to find those

 facts under one clause of ACCA but not the

 other.

 This Court should not set aside 

decades of consensus and impose on all federal 

and state courts an untested recidivism regime 

that would gravely prejudice defendants. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

the -- the right question is to ask whether 

there are sort of direct historical analogues. 

But, to answer your question directly first, I 

do think that the statutes that Mr. Feigin 

mentioned about sequencing that go back to the 

early 1800s, finding that an offense occurred

after a prior conviction, that an offense 

occurred after a defendant escaped or was

 released from prison, I think those are quite

 analogous to the occasions clause.

 I think, at bottom, in most cases, the

 occasions clause is essentially asking judges to

 make a question about -- to make a decision 

about sequencing, about how prior offenses 

occurred, whether they occurred one after 

another.  And I do think these statutes that, 

again, go back to the early 1800s are quite 

similar in that regard. 

I -- I do want to say, though, I don't 

think that that's the right historical question. 

I think the way the Court should think about the 

historical inquiry here is to ask, at the time 

of the Founding, was there a settled practice 

that legislatures had to treat recidivism as an 

element of the offense?  And I think the answer 

to that question is no, as Almendarez-Torres 

recognized. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why 

doesn't bifurcation take care of all the 

problems from your perspective?

things, Your Honor. I think, first, bifurcation

 is -- is extremely rare in criminal cases. I

 think the other side has cited only two contexts 

in which it occurs regularly. One is the death 

penalty context, where it's required by statute.

 The other is the criminal forfeiture context,

 where it's required by rule.

 And I think, here, it's going to be

 discretionary.  And I don't think they've cited 

you a -- a case in -- or a context in which 

discretionary bifurcation happens as a matter of 

course.  And I do think that the -- because it's 

discretionary, the government is, I think, going 

to have good arguments against bifurcation in at 

least some cases.  I would think if I were the 

government I would argue that the government has 

a right to present all of its evidence on all of 

the elements of the crime to a single jury so 

that that jury can make a moral judgment about 

whether this defendant has committed the crime 

as defined by Congress, and the defendant 

doesn't have the right to sort of hide an 

element from the jury on the first go-round and 

then show it to it -- the jury in a bifurcated 

proceeding.

And I think there already is some

 evidence of this. So we cite the Harrell case

 at page 46 of our brief.  That's a case in which

 the government -- the prosecutor opposed

 bifurcation post-Wooden.  The judge denied

 bifurcation.  And then the -- the defendant was 

forced to stipulate to the occasions question.

 And the jury was told, this is a

 three-time convicted felon, and then the 

prosecutor at closing told the jury this is a 

drug-slinging, gun-toting, three-time convicted 

felon. So I think that shows that when 

prosecutors decide they don't want to bifurcate, 

judges may well agree with that and that when 

they don't bifurcate, it's going to be seriously 

prejudicial to defendants. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of 

course, part of their answer is that this will 

be an incentive for the defendants to plead. 

MR. HARPER: So I think that's right, 

but I think that goes to my point, which is that 

this is -- this is prejudicial whether it's --

it's -- it forces defendants to plead to worse 

deals or it forces them to go through 

non-bifurcated proceedings in which these prior

convictions are paraded before the jury.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  There are a lot of

 occasions in which a -- a defendant might love 

to have a bifurcated proceeding because jurors 

don't usually think like lawyers, who are open

 to arguments in the alternative, so if the --

you know, if the defense is going to be, I 

didn't do it, but if I did it, I didn't have the 

intent that is necessary under the statute, it 

might be really beneficial to have a trial first 

on the actus reus and then have a separate trial 

later on the mens rea. 

MR. HARPER: So I think there's no 

doubt that defendants are going to want to have 

bifurcated trials.  I think the question is 

whether the government is going to want to. And 

Mr. Feigin said that at least the federal 

government is going to be willing to do that in 

most cases, apparently not all cases, but most 

cases. 

But I don't think there's any 

guarantee that's -- this is going to apply to 

the states.  Whatever this Court says in this 

case is going to apply to the states too, and I 

don't think there's any guarantee that state

 prosecutors are going to feel the same way.

 In fact, I would think -- I mean, I 

would think that this is going to be a pretty 

significant piece of leverage that prosecutors 

can use against defendants to say either plead 

to a worse deal or we're going to try to get 

this in front of a jury, and that's -- and it's

 seriously prejudicial.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it's the 

right historical question to ask whether there 

was an established precedent on the narrow 

question, whether recidivism questions, whether 

the question whether the defendant had committed 

other offenses in the past, was recognized as an 

exception at the time of the adoption of the 

Sixth Amendment, or would the broader question 

be more appropriate, which was whether it was 

well understood at the time of the adoption of 

the Sixth Amendment that judges could make 

discretionary sentencing decisions, which would 

take into account prior criminal convictions? 

And if it's the broader question, the 

historical evidence is extremely strong, as --

as distinguished scholars have pointed out.  At 

the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment,

the -- the first Congress, which sent the Sixth

 Amendment to the states, also adopted the first

 criminal -- federal criminal proceedings.

 And contrary to the suggestion in

 Apprendi, they didn't say, if you commit -- if 

you commit burglary, you get five years'

 imprisonment.  No, they said, if you commit such 

and such an offense, you shall be sentenced to 

no more than a certain sentence, which gave the 

trial judge discretion. 

MR. HARPER: So, to be candid, Your 

Honor, I think there are two lines of history 

here. One is the history you just referenced, 

which is that judges have enormous -- an 

enormous amount of discretion to, you know, 

change sentences within a sentencing range. 

The other is the Apprendi line of 

history, which is that generally speaking, 

sentence enhancing facts about present crimes 

were treated as elements that had to go to a 

jury. And so I think the relevant historical 

question is, was there a uniform understanding 

about sort of which box these recidivism-related 

facts fell into? 

And I think the answer is no. I think

the answer is that there were at least eight 

states that we've identified going back to the

 early 1800s that -- where legislatures had 

discretion to treat recidivism as an element of 

the offense or not, and that's because 

recidivism was different than facts about

 present crimes.  It went to punishment only, not

 guilt. And -- and putting that recidivism --

 those recidivism facts before a jury would 

seriously prejudice the defendant. 

So I think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mr. --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- when we start 

talking about history, I -- I get very annoyed 

because, in every history, there are exceptions. 

The question then becomes how many of an 

exception defeats the general rule.  I'm not 

going to argue whether it was eight or four.  I 

think it was four.  And so I don't think that 

that defeats the general rule.  That's the 

point. 

As to your earlier question on what 

prejudices a defendant or not, it's really only 

a defendant that has a viable single occasion

 it because both with perjury enhancements to 

sentencing that judges possess, as well as 

annoying a judge enough so that a lighter

 sentence is unlikely because, when the sentence

 comes about, you're going to add the 15 years to 

a base that the judge can have from a low to a

are on the other side. I think they've clearly 

made a judgment that this rule that Petitioner 

and the government are urging is a net benefit 

for criminal defendants, and I -- I don't think 

you should take my word over theirs on that. 

What I think -- my submission, though,

is that I think it's indisputable that in some 

cases, like Your Honor said, the cases where

 this is a close question and the government

 refuses to bifurcate, I think it's going to

 prejudice defendants.  I think that's what the 

Harrell case that we cite at page 46 shows.

 In some cases, this is going to

 prejudice defendants, and I think that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, isn't that true 

of Apprendi generally?  I mean, Apprendi was not 

justified on the basis of this is always going 

to help defendants.  There are any number of 

elements that a particular defendant might prove 

and might decide in a particular set of 

circumstances he would rather argue to a judge. 

I -- I mean, you know, it just doesn't 

seem to me that that's a reason for denying the 

force of Apprendi in this situation. 

MR. HARPER: So I agree that the same 

could be said of the prejudice point on -- in 

Apprendi.  But I think this is not just 

something that I'm making up.  This is what 

courts have said going back hundreds of years, 

there's a reason to treat recidivism 

differently.

And so I think Apprendi recognized a

 tradition as to present crimes, and Apprendi 

made that very clear at pages 488 and 496 of the

 opinion in distinguishing Almendarez-Torres.

 What the Court said there was that

 Almendarez-Torres was about prior crimes.  It

 was about -- it was about issues that didn't go 

to the defendant's guilt. They went to

 punishment only. 

This tradition that we're recognizing 

here is about present crimes.  And I think 

courts recognized that it was both the prejudice 

point and the fact that this was sort of a 

collateral issue, it was more like a sentencing 

issue, was why there was a different tradition 

as to recidivism. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So your point is 

it wasn't a historical accident necessarily, it 

was justified by a principle of not prejudicing 

-- prejudicing defendants? 

MR. HARPER: That's right.  And I 

think a good place to look for this is the 

Bishop treatise, one -- the -- one of the 

leading criminal law treatise writers of the 

19th Century said just that.  He said that

 recidivism is treated differently because it --

putting it before a jury is seriously

 prejudicial to defendants and because this is an 

issue that's more like a sentencing issue, 

which, as Justice Alito noted, has a tradition

 for hundreds of years as being not subject to

 Sixth Amendment constraints.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On Justice -- on 

Justice Sotomayor's question, because I think 

the methodological question if we get deep into 

this is pretty important here, to how to think 

about all this, so start with the text. The 

text itself of the Constitution does not tell us 

the answer, just the bare words, correct? 

MR. HARPER: Correct. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So then we 

usually look to history.  We might not like it, 

but I don't --

MR. HARPER: Agreed. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- unless we're 

just making it up, I don't -- I don't know where 

else we're going to look. And the question Mr. 

Fisher raised was who has the burden on that, 

and I think I'd like you to speak to who has the 

burden.

Do you have the burden to show a 

consistent, uniform practice or does he have the 

burden to show a consistent, uniform practice

 going the other way in which recidivism always 

went to the jury? 

MR. HARPER: So I think that is the 

critical question because, if the government has

 the burden, then I see no way in which

 Almendarez-Torres is correctly decided. 

But I think that the government in 

these cases does not have the burden because I 

think, as a default principle, when somebody is 

coming into this Court or a court saying the 

Constitution violates or invalidates my sentence 

or invalidates a statute, typically, it is upon 

that person to show that there is some 

well-established understanding that that's what 

the Constitution means. 

And sometimes, when the text is clear, 

like in the Gaudin case that Mr. Fisher cited, 

then the burden flips to the government to show 

some -- some historical practice that 

contradicts the text. 

But, as Your Honor noted, the text 

here doesn't answer the question, and so we're

 looking to history.  And I would say we're not

 only just looking -- we're not looking to

 history directly interpreting the text of the

 Sixth Amendment.  We're looking to history --

 we're looking to state common law principles.

 And I think, when the Court is that 

far removed from something actually interpreting 

the Sixth Amendment, the Court should demand a 

level of uniformity in those state common law 

principles before making the leap that the 

Constitution necessarily incorporated those 

common law principles. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Is the right year 

to look at 1791 or 1868?  Obviously, this is a 

federal case, but --

MR. HARPER: So I think there's 

certainly academic debate about that.  I think, 

for purposes of this case, the right -- the time 

of the Founding is obviously the most relevant 

time. 

And -- and I guess what I would say is 

I think, if anything, what the history shows 

here is that there was a almost uniform practice 

that legislatures had discretion in this area. 

So it wasn't only the four states where judges

were allowed to make findings about recidivism. 

It was also four -- four states -- we have

 Virginia, Massachusetts, and Maine, significant

 states, between 1818 and 1824 enacting

 supplemental information statutes that allowed 

the government to withhold recidivism 

allegations from an indictment, despite that --

 generally requiring all elements of an offense

 to be in an indictment.  So we have at least 

eight -- and then West Virginia added on a 

similar statute in 1868.  So we have eight 

states. 

And then I think the government -- on 

the other side, the government and Petitioner 

haven't cited a single case in any relevant time 

period where a court struck down a statute on 

the ground that it assigned recidivism findings 

to -- to judges or allowed the government to 

withhold these allegations from -- from the 

indictment. 

And so I think, as far as I can see, 

there's an unrebutted tradition here of 

legislatures having discretion when it comes to 

recidivism, and I think there were good reasons 

for that, as we discussed.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Did all of those

 states -- I mean, you know, the Sixth Amendment

 didn't apply to the states back then.  So in --

when you're saying, well, you can't point to a 

single one in which a court struck it down, were

 there state analogues to the Sixth Amendment

 that would be relevant?

 MR. HARPER: So I think the states did

 have comparable jury trial rights, and also 

states in which the supplemental information 

statutes were enacted, they had grand jury 

requirements that required all elements to be in 

an indictment. 

And so -- and these were challenged on 

constitutional grounds, and courts uniformly 

upheld them. This goes all the way back to 1824 

and the Massachusetts Ross case that we cite in 

our brief, all the way through to this Court's 

decision in Graham.  There's no decision that 

I'm aware of to the contrary. 

So I do think there is a -- even if it 

was -- even if it were our burden to show a 

uniform tradition here, I think the uniform 

tradition was one of legislative discretion when 

it comes to recidivism.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  What about Mathis

 and Descamps?  You know, it's true they're

 statutory cases, but, you know, there is some

 avoidance language in them, which you recognize 

in your brief. Do you want to talk about that a

 little about it? 

MR. HARPER: Sure.  So the language in

 Mathis and Descamps, admittedly, not great for

 my position here.  I -- I think -- I do think 

that the Court --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  We appreciate your 

candor. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. HARPER: I do think that the Court 

just didn't resolve the constitutional question 

in those cases.  I said -- they -- they were --

as you said, they were avoidance cases.  I think 

most of what the Court held in those cases was 

that there is a serious constitutional question 

about the scope of Almendarez-Torres.  And I

theory for a second? You said in your opening 

that you find the other side's position to be

 unprincipled.  So why is that?

 MR. HARPER: So for a few reasons.  I

 think, first of all, they -- their principle in 

this case, which I think Mr. Fisher reiterated

 in his opening, was that -- this elements-only

 principle, this principle that judges can only 

find facts that juries previously found beyond a 

reasonable doubt. 

And I just don't think that their 

theory, their -- their test that they end up 

articulating line up with that principle because 

they recognize that if the Court were to 

double-down on that elements-only principle, it 

would blow up the categorical -- categorical 

approach because judges, in doing predicate 

felony determinations, often find facts that are 

not elements of prior offenses, like identity, 

like the date of the offense, like the 

sequencing issue in Almendarez-Torres itself. 

So they articulate -- they have to 

fall back from their elements-only principle, 

and they end up articulating standards like the 

government's standard, for example, facts

 encapsulated in judicial records that are

 components of prior convictions. I think that's 

what the government says. That test is in no

 decision of this Court.  I don't think it's in a 

decision of any court as far as I can tell.

 And so I think, because they are 

departing from their principle, they are

 articulating novel tests that really don't have

 any grounding in this Court. 

And then I -- the last thing I would 

say is that I think their test, at -- at least 

the government's test, is not descriptively 

accurate, even to -- because the -- the -- the 

test, facts encapsulated in judicial records, 

that -- identity is not encapsulated in judicial 

records.  The date of the offense is not a 

component of the prior conviction. 

So I think the government's test and I 

think Petitioner's test too, although I'm a 

little less clear on what Petitioner's test 

actually is, I think none of them have a 

principle that actually explains where they end 

up landing.

 little bit of tension with each other.  And who

 would deny that really?  I mean, even Apprendi

 understood that.

 But there's nothing about that bit of

 tension that has made the system fail to work. 

And, you know, why would we allow that bit of 

tension, which has existed for decades now, to 

suggest an answer to this question that does not 

seem the one that all our past precedents point 

to? 

MR. HARPER: So I -- I guess I would 

say I don't think there needs to be tension 

between Apprendi and Almendarez-Torres.  I 

think, certainly, under the government and 

Petitioner's view, there is tension.  But I 

think under -- my reading of Apprendi and 

Almendarez-Torres is that they're -- they drew a 

pretty clear line between facts about prior 

crimes, facts about present crimes.  I think, 

again, Apprendi said that multiple times. 

And so I think, if you interpret it 

that way, it's -- the -- the tension sort of 

resolves itself.  And I think the fact that the 

Court has -- or -- or courts have found

felony inquiry suggests that that's really what 

the line is, is I think my fundamental point.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Your -- on the 

tension, I think your point is that the history 

has two different rules.

 MR. HARPER: That's right.  And I

 think --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And -- and --

MR. HARPER: -- Almendarez-Torres 

recognized that. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- and it's rooted 

in concern about prejudicing defendants. 

MR. HARPER: That's right.  And I 

think, in Apprendi itself, the Court demanded a 

uniform standard as to sentence-enhancing facts 

about present crimes.  And so I think it would 

be somewhat anomalous not to require an 

extension of that uniformity down to the 

different tradition of recidivism facts.  And I 

think that's exactly what Almendarez-Torres 

recognized, admittedly, before Apprendi, but 

that there was no such uniform tradition in this 

different context.  And so, in this context, 

facts about present crimes, those don't need the

they were an outlier as to the default common

had a default common law rule that these 

recidivism findings or these recidivism facts

contradict that. So I think that is a fair 

assumption.

states within that majority, Virginia,

 Massachusetts, Maine, these are significant 

states that were a part of the initial compact

 and that allowed legislatures to deviate from 

the common law rule. And then, when those 

supplemental information statutes were 

challenged in court on constitutional grounds,

 courts rejected those challenges all the way

 through to this Court's decision in 1910 

endorsing the Massachusetts Ross decision from 

1824. 

So I think there's just a uniform 

string of precedents saying this majority common 

law rule that recidivism has to be in the 

indictment and proved to a jury is something the 

legislature can alter.

14, I think it's subject to the discretion of 

the trial judge, subject to abuse of discretion

 review.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Would there be any

 constitutional overlay on that?  In other words, 

it was impermissible to deny bifurcation under

 these circumstances?

 MR. HARPER: I don't think so.  I

 think the Court has refused to require 

bifurcation as a constitutional matter, and I 

don't think the Court should do so in this case. 

And I also don't think the Court 

should sort of place a thumb on the scale even 

if the Court sides with Petitioner and the 

government here to say that bifurcation should 

ordinarily be required in these cases because I 

do think there is something to -- to the -- to 

the idea that the government really does have a, 

I think, a right to present to a single jury all 

of the -- all of its evidence on all of the 

elements of the crime. 

And if you rule for Petitioner and the 

government here, I think what you are saying is 

that this occasions fact is sort of an element 

of the crime.

And then -- and then, on

 bifurcation -- I think bifurcation, the other

 problem which I mentioned earlier is that states 

have varying procedures on bifurcation, and so 

some of them make it discretionary, and I -- I

 think -- so it's going to have -- it's hard to

 say exactly how this is going to play out in the

 states.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  That's true with 

respect to Old Chief too? 

MR. HARPER: Correct.  I think Old 

Chief -- I think Old Chief doesn't really solve 

the prejudice problem because, as you see from 

the Harrell case we cite, that case involved an 

Old Chief stipulation, so the bifurcation was 

denied.  The defendant was then forced to 

stipulate or he chose to stipulate, I guess, 

under Old Chief. 

And that stipulation has to be read to 

the jury, and that jury has to be told this is a 

three-time convicted felon. That's a big 

difference from being told this is a, you know, 

a one-time convicted felon.

about -- and Justice Jackson too -- about what 

kind of proof would be used to prove this up to

 a jury.  Do you have anything to say about that?

 MR. HARPER: So I think, if it's going

 before a jury, subject to the rules of evidence, 

which, admittedly, I'm not an expert on, I think 

anything that's admissible and relevant I would 

think would be able to be used to prove this

 question to a jury. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it would make it 

harder since they don't apply to a judge and a 

judge has to find these things by a 

preponderance if you're right? 

MR. HARPER: I think that it 

probably -- I'm sure the standard would make it 

harder for them to prove these issues. 

Again, I don't think it -- I agree 

with the government that I don't think this is 

going to matter in all that many cases because I 

think most of these cases are going to be pretty 

clear that the crimes were on separate 

occasions.  This case, for example, I think it's 

clear beyond a doubt, as the government said, 

that this is -- these crimes occurred multiple 

days apart.  They were on separate occasions.

And I think most juries -- I guess the 

one point I would make is there is a potential 

nullification risk, I think, in some of these

 cases because of the severe mandatory minimums 

at issue. And I think the Petitioner cited one 

case in his cert petition where a Georgia jury

 refused to find different occasions despite

 the -- the -- the -- the convictions being or

 the offenses being months and years apart. 

So I do think that might happen in 

some cases, but for the most part, I think these 

are going to be pretty straightforward. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank -- thank 

you, counsel. 

Justice Thomas, any -- anything

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a lot of 

debate on whether historically jury 

nullification was an okay thing. 

MR. HARPER: That -- that's right, 

Your Honor.  I don't want to wade into that 

debate. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I'm -- I'm not 

suggesting we do.  But it is an open question.

 Rebuttal, Mr. Fisher.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Thank you.  I'd like to

 cover two topics.  First, a couple more words

 about bifurcation. 

There was some talk about state 

practices. Even in 1967, when the Court looked 

at this issue in Spencer, it noted that the 

majority of the states require bifurcation by 

statute.  It's not even a prosecutorial 

discretion, discretionary decision. 

And I think that trend has continued 

for all the common-sense reasons laid out in 

the -- in the briefs you have.  So, Justice 

Kavanaugh, it's not even a constitutional 

question necessarily.  It's just already been 

decided by the states. 

If you had -- you know, this is a 

federal case where you have your own supervisory 

powers and you can, I think, you know, make 

whatever suggestions you like in the opinion,

and we think it would be appropriate for the

 Court to say that bifurcation is the accepted 

solution here that seems to be the right one.

 I'd also like to say a couple words

 about the harmless error conversation that's

 taken place today.

 We haven't briefed that issue

 precisely because the Court's common practice

 and -- and overwhelming practice is to leave 

decisions -- leave questions like that that were 

not addressed by the lower courts for the lower 

courts to decide in the first instance. 

And that's what we'd ask for the Court 

to do here.  And -- and forgive me, I may have 

even misunderstood the way the amicus 

appointment works in this case.  You know, 

of course, we are -- we are not in line with the 

government on harmless error in this case, but 

the government's top-side brief said the case 

should be remanded for harmless error. 

And so, on the issue on which we are 

adverse to the government, you know, I don't 

know that amicus can come in and tell this Court 

to go ahead and address it. 

But leaving -- you know, leaving that

perhaps thorny issue of the Court's practice

 aside, in all events, we think the safest thing 

is to leave that for remand.

 But -- but I'll just add a couple of 

things about the factual conversation that took

 place today.  Remember, when the -- when you ask

 whether these crimes that are alleged to be 

committed on eight days, you know, on an

 eight-day stretch, three different crimes on an 

eight-day stretch could possibly be the same 

occasion, you are yourselves relying on these 

kinds of documents that you have noted in Mathis 

and Descamps are highly unreliable.  And, in 

fact, these documents themselves, the plea 

documents themselves here say that Mr. Erlinger 

agrees to cooperate against all of his 

co-defendants. 

There were no co-defendants in these 

cases. And so, Justice Jackson, you noted that 

an indictment might say on or about certain 

days. And when you get into an eight-day 

stretch, on or about matters quite a lot. 

So what we would say on remand in part 

-- and this goes to Justice Gorsuch's questions 

about how harmless error would work here -- is
