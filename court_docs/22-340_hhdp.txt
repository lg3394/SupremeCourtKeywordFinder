 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-340, Pulsifer

 versus United States.

 Mr. Dvoretzky.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The natural reading of 

Section 3553(f)(1) is that "and" means "and." 

It joins together enumerated criteria.  To be 

safety valve eligible, a defendant must not 

have (A), (B), and (C), all three.  That's what 

ordinary grammar says and the surrounding text 

confirms.  Congress used "and" to join 

(f)(1)(A) through (C) just as it used "and" to 

require a defendant to satisfy each of (f)(1) 

through (5).  This reading makes sense. 

The historic First Step Act made the 

safety valve available for many more nonviolent 

drug offenders.  Taken together, (A) through 

(C) exclude violent recidivists with a history 

of committing serious crimes, while (f)(2)

through (f) disqualify current violent

 offenders.

 The government needs "and" to mean 

"or" or it needs the Court to insert the words

 "does not have" into the statute three times. 

But asking for a rewrite isn't statutory

 interpretation.  The government's surplusage 

and policy arguments don't change that.

 There is no surplusage because the 

statute and the guidelines contemplate that not 

every sentence for a prior offense earns 

criminal history points. 

As for policy, the government focuses 

on whether someone with serial -- serious 

criminal history could still satisfy (f)(1). 

But the safety valve isn't a 

get-out-of-jail-free card.  Serious recidivists 

will likely have a career offender enhanced 

guidelines range at or above the mandatory 

minimum, and judges can and do exercise their 

discretion to impose appropriate sentences. 

If Congress wanted to disqualify 

defendants for having any of (A), (B), or (C), 

all it had to do was say "or."  That would have 

unequivocally expressed a distributive meaning,

just as Congress did elsewhere in 3553(f).

 Letting the government get to "or" 

when Congress said "and" would encourage 

Congress to be sloppy with the most basic 

English words, leaving square corners far 

behind and, in the criminal context, where 

fairness matters most. The Court should hold 

Congress to what it wrote.

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  From your argument, 

it appears you do not accept the argument that 

"and" could have a distributive effect --

reading and a joint reading? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Not in this context, 

Justice Thomas, not -- not in the context --

not in the structure of a conjunctive negative 

proof like what we have here in this statute. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  In what context can 

it have a distributive meaning? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So I -- I think the 

government gives a number of examples where, 

again, not in a conjunctive negative proof 

context, you might hear "and" to be "or."  I 

think what's going on in a lot of those 

examples, it's almost like your brain is

 auto-correcting from "and" to "or."  The proper 

word actually would be "or" because, again,

 "and" ordinarily connects things together.

 But sometimes people use English in a 

less precise way, and, again, you -- you might

 understand that to mean "or."  That doesn't 

mean that it's syntactically correct, and that

 doesn't -- that's not the standard that 

Congress ought to be held to when it's writing 

a statute, let alone a criminal statute. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is that what -- I 

mean, let me give you a hypothetical, and tell 

me if you think it falls into that category. 

So you're going in for a medical test 

and you receive something from the hospital, 

and it says, to receive this test, the patient 

should not, and then, you know, it has, like, a 

list of things that the patient shouldn't do, 

and it says the patient shouldn't eat any food, 

drink any liquids, and smoke. 

So I'm going to assume, Mr. Dvoretzky, 

that you're not a smoker.  Do you feel 

perfectly able to eat and drink as much as you 

want? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  No. And that is a

 situation where I would hear that "and" to be 

an "or," but there are a couple things about

 that -- first of all, in your hypothetical, 

that's all the text that we have to work with,

 whereas, in 30 -- 3553(f), we have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let's keep it

 with my text, because you have some arguments

 about other texts and the government has some

 arguments about superfluity and anomalies, so 

let's just keep it to the text itself. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, if we're focused 

just on your hypothetical, I -- I probably -- I 

would hear that to be an "or" rather than an 

"and." 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Obviously, because the 

context tells you that it's an "or" rather than 

an "and," that -- and -- and -- and the reason 

that it's different from an example like "drink 

and drive," which is, you know, your example, 

is there's something that connects those two 

things so that we know that the harm comes from 

the relationship between the two, whereas, in 

this case, we know that the harm follows from 

any one of the things. 

So, either way, you're using context

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, the -- the other

 thing that we know from your hypothetical, if 

I'm going in for a medical test, my mindset 

going into the medical test, I'm not taking any

 chances with the instructions that the doctor

 gives me. If there's any ambiguity about

 whether "and" means "or," I'm going to take the 

safer course because I want to make sure that 

my medical test goes properly. 

So there is the context of the person 

who is giving you that instruction that I think 

also would lead you to take the safer choice 

there, which is to treat the "and" as an "or." 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But, Mr. 

Dvoretzky --

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- can I ask you --

you know, it -- I hear you saying to Justice 

Kagan, and you said this to Justice Thomas, 

that your brain corrects "and"/"or."  And when 

Justice Thomas asked you about whether the 

distributive understanding of "and" is 

grammatically correct, you kind of seemed to 

say no because you keep going to this example

where your brain changes "and" to "or." So I 

just wanted a clear answer from you on that.

 So you -- do you think that the

 distributive understanding of "and" is

 grammatically correct?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think it can be

 grammatically correct in certain contexts but

 not in this context.  But --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So what about the 

corpus linguistics brief that says in 

38 percent of the time -- I understand -- and 

you rely heavily on the fact that over 

50 percent of the time, people understood it in 

its joint sense, but 38 percent of the time, 

they understood it in its distributive sense. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So -- so they did, and 

the corpus linguistics scholars concluded that 

it was unnatural for "and" to have a 

distributive meaning in that sense.  By 

contrast, they also concluded that a hundred 

percent of people would understand "or" to be 

distributive when used in a negative proof. 

So, if you said, as -- as "Reading 

Law" does, Justice Scalia and Professor Garner, 

in order to qualify, you must not have (A),

(B), or (C), that would be unequivocally clear 

to express a distributive meaning, and it would 

be unnatural to use "and" even though some 

people might hear it that way and understand it 

to be distributive even in that kind of a

 negated conjunction.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You -- you've been 

wanting to have the chance to explain why the

 context here is different and point to your 

contextual clues in this statute that are 

different from some of the hypotheticals you've 

heard. I'd just like to hear those. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Sure.  So there --

there are a few points that I would make. 

First of all, the presumption of 

consistent usage.  Congress used "and" to 

connect (f)(1) through (f), just as it used 

"and" to connect (f)(1)(A) through (C). And 

so, in both instances, that needs to have a 

consistent joint meaning, particularly since 

3553(f) is all one long sentence. 

By contrast -- and this goes to the 

meaningful variation canon -- Congress used 

"or" throughout the statute as a disjunctive 

term. Look, for example, at 3553(f)(4), a

defendant satisfies that provision if he was 

not an "organizer, leader, manager, or 

supervisor" and "was not engaged in a

 continuing criminal enterprise." So Congress

 knows how to use "or" and "and" to mean 

different things, and that's what it did in

 3553.

 In addition to that, the government's 

argument is that "does not have" from the 

beginning of 3553(f)(1) gets distributed to A, 

B, and C. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But it comes --

MR. DVORETZKY:  It's that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- before the --

before the dash. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  It comes before the em 

dash. So there are a couple of reasons why the 

em dash doesn't support that distribution in 

addition to the obvious preliminary point that 

the statute doesn't say does not have A, does 

not have B, and does not have C. 

One, Congress itself didn't think that 

the em dash distributed the language before it. 

If it did, then it would not have had to repeat 

in A, B, and C the phrase "as determined under

have instead said, the defendant does not have, 

as determined under the Sentencing Guidelines,

 em dash A, B, C.  Instead, Congress repeated

 that every time.  So Congress didn't think the 

em dash was distributing.

 Second, it --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So that's your own

 superfluidity argument on your end. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, I actually don't

B, and does not have C, you agree that the 

government wins, is that right?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes, because that 

would be setting out three independent

 conditions.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. So -- so --

so, when we look at this statute, I mean, isn't 

what is most likely to have gone on here is 

that Congress made a completely ordinary 

drafting decision which said does not have A, 

does not have B, and does not have C? Who 

writes like that? 

What we usually do is we try to make 

writing efficient and not repetitive, and so we 

take out terms that apply to everything and put 

it in a format where we don't have to keep 

repeating it.  Put it in exactly this format. 

I -- I mean, you know, we do this in 

our ordinary writing.  Congress does it in 

writing statutes.  We don't keep on repeating a 

verb when the verb applies to everything. 

So that's what Congress did here. It 

just took out the -- rather than say "does not 

have" three times, it took it out and put it in 

prefatory language, followed by three things

that you shouldn't have.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Two points, Justice

 Kagan. One, yet Congress did repeat under the 

-- under -- "as determined under the Sentencing 

Guidelines" three times, which it didn't have

 to under that -- under that approach.

 Second, though, if you look at

 3553(f), the opening paragraph, that also ends

 with an em dash.  So, if the em dash 

distributes what's come -- what comes before to 

each of (f)(1) through (5) -- I mean, I'm 

sorry, if -- if the em dash in (f)(1)(A) 

distributes "does not have" to each of A, B, 

and C, then the em dash at the end of 3553(f) 

also ought to be understood to distribute what 

precedes that em dash to each of (f)(1) through 

(5). If that's right, then a defendant who 

satisfies any one of those (f)(1), (2), (3), 

(4), or (5), would qualify for relief. 

So, for example --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, "does not 

have" --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You --

distributive meaning there too, as Judge Oldham

 know, "if the court finds at sentencing after 

the Government has been afforded an

 opportunity," et cetera, that could have a

 distributive meaning, and -- and then it 

wouldn't be Calvinball, you know, as -- as

 you've been saying.  You could say it's

 distributive in both situations.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  So I think what gets 

distributed before the em dash -- the -- the 

government on page 38 of their brief explains 

the em dash rule that they're advocating for, 

the distributive rule that they're advocating 

for. They say that each item after the em dash 

must be a "logical and grammatical 

continuation" of the prefatory clause so that 

the two can be read together without regard to 

the rest of the provision, as if it were 

complete. 

And so what would actually get 

distributed goes all the way back to "the court 

shall impose a sentence" without regard to --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  It doesn't have to.

 case. I think it's a very hard case, so I

 don't mean to suggest that it's clear.

 All I'm saying is that there is a way 

to read it that would be perfectly consistent 

by treating that last clause as distributive.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I think that would not

 allow the distribution to be a complete

 sentence in the same way that starting it 

earlier would --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You --

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- and that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- you agree that 

determining whether the "and" distributes 

depends on context as a general matter, 

correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  As a general matter, I 

do, but I think that the key context to look to 

is the surrounding text in the first instance.

violent records, violent offense records, would 

be eligible for the safety valve, while 

offenders with less serious violent offense 

records would not be eligible, and the

 government says that would defy common sense.

 In addition to the superfluity 

argument they make, that seems to me a serious

 contextual issue that you have to deal with. 

So how -- how do you deal with that? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, Justice Kavanaugh, 

Congress didn't have a reason to be concerned 

about joining A, B, and C for a few reasons. 

One, it knew that defendants would 

still have to satisfy the rest of (f)(2) 

through (f), which focuses on the -- whether 

the instant offense is a violent crime or not. 

And Congress could quite rationally have 

thought that was the focus. 

In addition to that, as I said in my 

introduction --

premise, though, that -- that your 

interpretation would mean offenders with more 

serious violent offense records would be

 circumstances?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I was going to

 say I -- I don't accept that as a categorical

 proposition.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  In certain

 circumstances?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  It -- there -- you can 

find individual cases where that would be true, 

but as Chief Judge Pryor explained in the 

Garcon case, Congress legislates at a macro 

level, not at a micro level.  That can lead to 

particular cases where results might be 

anomalous. 

The reason that it doesn't defy common 

sense, though, to use the phrase that I think 

you used in your question, Congress knew that, 

first, a defendant would have to satisfy (f)(2) 

through (f), and, second, the safety valve 

itself, all that means is that courts exercise 

discretion to impose proportionate sentences --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  (f)(2) through (f)

 don't have anything to do with criminal 

history, though, per se, right?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  They -- they -- they

 don't. And Congress could quite rationally,

 given the history of the -- the -- given the

 history of mandatory minimums and what Congress 

was trying to achieve here, wanted to focus 

more on the nature of the instant offense than 

on criminal history.  But even as to criminal 

history, district judges can and do take that 

into account. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Don't they --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but, presumably, 

they --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- have to under the 

Sentencing Guidelines?  I mean, the safety 

valve just removes the mandatory minimum, but 

don't the judges then have to look at the 

guidelines, and wouldn't you expect that a 

defendant who had a number of serious criminal 

violent priors, the guidelines would take 

account of that in terms of what the ultimate 

sentence was going to be?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  No, please.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I didn't mean to

 interrupt.  You mentioned surplusage.  Could we

 talk about that?  If (B) and (C) made (A) 

100 percent surplusage, what would you say?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I would -- even in 

that circumstance, as Judge Newsom, for 

example, said in Garcon, you would still have 

to adhere to the ordinary meaning of "and" in 

-- in this situation, and the surplusage would 

not matter. 

But it -- it -- (B) and (C) don't make 

(A) surplusage, and I think that's for the 

reason that Chief Judge Pryor, who was a former 

acting chair of the Sentencing Commission, 

explained in Garcon.  That is that not every 

sentence for a prior offense earns criminal 

history points. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well --

MR. DVORETZKY:  You can have --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- okay.  I understand 

that argument.  Suppose I think that if it made 

it a hundred percent surplusage, that would be 

a pretty strong argument against you.  Let's

just take that as an assumption.

 Would you draw a distinction between

 that situation, where it's a hundred percent

 surplusage, and the situation where it's 

99 percent surplusage or 98 percent surplusage?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I don't know that 

I would because, either way, the surplusage 

canon isn't an absolute rule, and it doesn't 

justify in this case overriding the ordinary 

meaning of "and."  The other -- the other 

textual cues that we've talked about and argued 

about in our brief, the Senate's drafting 

manual here is also a relevant consideration. 

The manual says that "and" indicates that 

something is included in a class only if it 

meets all of the criteria, whereas "or" says 

that something is included only if it meets one 

or more of the criteria. 

So the point is that Congress, by 

default, following that drafting manual, uses 

"and" in its joint sense.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I -- go.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- didn't Congress 

actually contemplate the difference between

 "and" and "or" in this very context?  And by

 that, I mean, are you familiar with the

 enactment history?  My understanding is that

 Congress looked at a bill in the previous cycle

 that would have done exactly -- almost exactly 

what happened here with respect to increasing 

to four points, including (B) and (C), and in 

that draft document, they used the word "or." 

And yet, here now, on the enactment of this, we 

have "and." 

So that suggests to me at least that 

Congress was consciously determining that there 

was a difference between "and" and "or." 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Sure.  And I think 

that there are a number of different 

indicators -- we can go through the list --

that Congress understood the difference between 

"and" and "or," and these are the words that it 

wrote, and the words that it wrote have to be 

given effect even in the face of surplusage.

going to go -- if we're going to go into the 

legislative history, though, when Senator 

Grassley introduced the bill that became law,

 the Judiciary Committee report on that said

 that it would exclude offenders with

 three-point felony convictions or prior

 two-point violent offenses.  So, if we're going

 to go down that road, which I'm not saying we 

should, but if we're going to go down that 

road, I'm not sure that that fully helps you. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So I think that 

particular legislative history that you're 

focused on, Judge -- Justice Kavanaugh, is a 

little bit mysterious because the rest of it 

also says that offenders will not be eligible 

for the safety valve "absent a judicial finding 

that those prior offenses substantially 

overstate the defendant's criminal history and 

danger of recidivism." 

So, while the statement that you're 

referring to used "or" rather than "and," the 

statement also suggests -- and I'm not quite 

sure where Congress was getting this -- that 

courts could exercise discretion to trigger the 

safety valve notwithstanding a defendant's

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I think

 it may have come from the legislation they had 

been looking at.  That exact language that you 

just read came from the Sentencing Reform Act 

of 2015 that used the "or" between (A), (B), 

"or" (C). But then it gave a discretion to the 

sentencing judge to ignore it.

 It actually supports your position 

that Congress knew that the "or" should be 

there but only if the court could deviate. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When it decided to 

take away the power to deviate, it raised up 

the qualifications by doing (A), (B), "and" 

(C). 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Right.  And all of 

that accords with the purpose of the First Step 

Act to move away from mandatory minimums 

towards considering the offender's individual 

circumstances in a particular case, which, of 

course, would include criminal history. 

District judges obviously apply the 

guidelines.  As the Federal Defenders' brief 

shows, I think at pages 7 to 8, district judges

 based on a defendant's criminal history.  The 

career offender guidelines lead to sentences

 routinely of 25 years to life.  And so the

 Sentencing Guidelines will account for the kind 

of individualized circumstances that Congress

 wanted.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  On that score, I --

I just wanted to take this case as an example 

to test it in my own mind, and I went back and 

looked at the presentence report and things 

like that.  And as I understand it, 15-year 

minimum, 180 months, for some reason, your 

client got 162, I'm not sure why.  Maybe you 

can tell me.  And that -- that -- so that would 

be the 15-year mandatory minimum. 

The safety valve gets him with his 

criminal history approximately, my -- my law 

clerks tell me, between 120 and 150 months.  He 

was over 60 years old when he's sentenced, so 

we're talking about whether he might be free 

when he's 70, 73, or 75.  Is -- is that what 

we're -- what's really at stake here?

Conceptually, look, Congress could 

have thought that the combination of (A), (B), 

and (C) was a particularly egregious 

combination, and that at a macro level was what 

it was targeting.  It could still serve some 

purpose.  Congress didn't know when it passed 

that what the numbers would look like.

Second, on a factual level, in 

response to those numbers, those numbers, the 

2.8 percent or whatever it is, that's 

calculating things under the Ninth Circuit's

 Lopez interpretation.  It's not calculating the 

numbers using the approach that we're 

advocating and that Chief Judge Pryor adopted 

in Garcon, which allows old offenses to be

 counted under (B) or (C) even if they don't 

count towards the criminal history total in 

(A). 

So we actually don't know what the 

numbers would look like when you apply the 

approach that we're advocating for those.

Let's just forget about special rules that 

apply to statutory interpretation for a moment

 and just talk about how language works in 

general and your understanding of that.

 If I say something and it's ambiguous 

and you're trying to figure out whether I mean 

A or B, to what degree do you take into account

 whether A or B makes more sense?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I might take it into 

account, but the other thing I would take into 

account is my relationship with you as the 

speaker. 

So, if -- to Justice Kagan's 

hypothetical, if my doctor tells me, don't do 

A, B, and C, my relationship with the doctor is 

I want to pass -- I want the medical test to go 

well, and I assume that my doctor is being very 

cautious and conservative, because my doctor 

is, so I'm going to -- that's the context. 

It's the relationship with the speaker that's 

letting me turn an "and" into an "or" there. 

In this situation, if Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I think that's 

a -- that's a -- that's a fair answer.  So we 

have -- you have to take into account the --

 complimentary one.  But, if that's how language 

works, don't we have to have some image of

 who -- who's the -- the speaker of this speech 

that we are interpreting? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, the -- the 

speaker in this case is an institution.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  But the institution is 

also speaking in the context of a criminal 

case. And where we have basic words like "and" 

and "or," I think you hold the -- the 

institution, the maker of laws, to a higher 

standard of precision than I would hold my 

doctor, who I know has my best interests at 

heart and is trying to make me well. 

And so, in that situation, where 

Congress knows how to use "and" or "or," and, 

again, particularly in a criminal context, 

where fairness is at stake, you hold Congress 

to the ordinary meaning of the word "and," 

which is not a distributive meaning in this 

kind of a context. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, I think that 

the move to textualism in our interpretation of 

statutes was enormously beneficial and it

eliminated a lot of abuses that previously

 occurred, but, in the end, we are just

 interpreting language.

 Everybody I assume in this courtroom

 today speaks the English language, and all

 we're trying to do is understand some words in

 the English language, and it just seems to me 

that a lot of these arguments that we've heard 

-- I mean -- I mean, the people here who 

haven't studied the case must think this is --

this is gibberish.  It might as well be -- it 

might as well be Greek with all this stuff 

about distributive and em dash and all of that. 

Is it necessarily that complicated? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So I -- I don't think 

it's complicated because I think that the 

natural way to express what Congress wanted to 

express here would have been "or."  Using "and" 

to express that any of the three would 

disqualify you is unnatural.  And -- and -- and 

so I -- I think that really is the key point, 

is that we're holding Congress to what the 

ordinary understanding of these terms is.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I want to go back 

to that point. And as I understood you

 earlier, when Congress wanted to use the

 distributive form, it generally did it. It did

 it in (f)(2) by using "the defendant did not 

use violence or credible threats of violence or 

possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon

 or..."

 When it wanted to do a "not" in 

(f)(4), it wrote, contrary to Justice Kagan's 

expectation, in a very cumbersome way, it said, 

the statute requires a defendant was not an 

organizer or leader and was not engaged, and it 

went on and on. 

So, here, the anomaly would be 

Congress changing course just for this one 

provision and changing "and" to mean "or." I 

think that's your basic point.  But assume that 

we have two ways of reading this statute, that 

you could accept that there was a possibility 

of reading "or" to mean "and." 

Where does the Rule of Lenity come 

into this?

the various textual cues that are available

 here, that this statute is just -- is

 grievously ambiguous -- that's the standard 

that the Court has used -- then, at that point, 

the Rule of Lenity calls for Mr. Pulsifer to

 win, favoring the defendant.

 And if Congress wants to change "and" 

to "or" in a revision of this statute, that's a

 very easy change for them to make, but the 

burden of that ought to be on Congress, not on 

defendants whose liberty is at stake in the 

face of a -- a seriously ambiguous statute. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where does 

surplusage and common sense come into that? 

Meaning, if all of the grammatical indicators 

suggest that "and" means "and", and "or" means 

"or," and the two are not the same, does that 

constitute a grievous enough ambiguity to say 

that lenity should play a part here? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I -- I think it 

does. I think that alone is enough to conclude 

that "and" means "and," even if there were 

surplusage, which I -- which I don't think 

there is.

not, because I think Justice Alito was saying,

 I don't know. Can you quantify that surplusage 

here? The number of cases that would fall into

 your exception, is it a lot?  Is it a little?

 I'm not sure.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Meaning the -- the

 number of cases where somebody would satisfy B

 and C but not A?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So -- so I can't 

quantify it, but Chief Judge Pryor and Judge 

Wood and others in the lower courts have given 

a number of examples where that could happen. 

You could have somebody with old offenses that 

qualify under B or C or tribal convictions or 

something subject to the single sentence rule. 

And the guidelines in those 

situations, like you could have points 

associated with those offenses that don't add

is focused on. 

How many of those cases there will be, 

I don't know, but Congress could quite 

rationally have thought that B and C were 

serving a different purpose than A.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I want to go back to

 Justice Alito's line of questioning, and you

 said that the -- the -- the difference between 

my hypothetical and this case has to do with 

the relationship between the speaker and the 

person listening to the injunction or the 

prohibition or whatever you want to call it. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  That's one difference, 

yeah. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  And -- and I 

think that that might be one difference.  But 

another difference, which is the one I 

suggested before, has to do with the 

relationship of the items on the list. 

And this is why "don't drink and 

drive" is so powerful, because, automatically, 

we understand that the harm that's being sought 

to be averted is the combination of the two, 

whereas other lists, you can see that the harms 

are much more independent, that things are 

independently disqualifying and would -- were 

meant to be independently disqualifying. 

And that's why the three-point/

 two-point anomaly seems so significant to me, 

because what that suggests is that these were

 meant -- you know, they -- when you -- when you 

take the intersection of those, it doesn't work 

under your reading and it does work under the

 government's reading.

 So I want you to respond to that view.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I -- I think the

 answer -- when you say it doesn't work, Justice 

Kagan, I -- I think what you mean by that is 

it's leading to an anomalous result in this 

particular case, that it --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, not just --

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- that doesn't --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- in this particular 

case. It leads to an anomalous result in the 

case of anybody who has lots of three-point 

offenses, both violent and non-violent, let's 

say, but does not have, just happens not to 

have a two-point violent offense. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  But it doesn't lead to 

anomalous results in a whole other class of 

cases where Congress might rationally have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's true. 

But this anomaly suggests that those two

 features, the three-point criterion and the

 two-point violent criterion, were meant to 

operate independently, each one being

 disqualifying.

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- that's one 

inference, but I don't think that's the only 

inference that you could draw from A, B, and C. 

Congress could have thought that A, B, and C 

combined were worse than any of them alone. 

Now, yes, that could lead to a 

situation where a -- a seemingly more serious 

offender qualifies under (f)(1) as opposed 

to -- as opposed to somebody who's a less 

serious offender. 

Congress didn't have a particular 

reason to be concerned about that because that 

offender would still have to satisfy (f)(2) 

through (5), and even then, the Sentencing 

Guidelines would take into account that 

person's criminal history and the district 

judge would take into account that criminal 

history when determining the sentence. 

So Congress had no reason to think 

that as a result of that supposed anomaly there 

would be unjust results in the real world.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let me see if I've

 The -- the two arguments we've heard 

this morning on the other side so far are that 

there's a surplusage problem you have, but 

everybody seems to admit there isn't a 

hundred percent surplusage.  It's some --

something less than that, so it's not really a 

surplusage argument of the kind we normally 

adopt or -- or take seriously. 

And the second is the 

two-point/three-point violent offender anomaly, 

which is in the nature of or in the direction 

of an absurdity argument, but it never really 

gets there.  And so everybody's dropped the --

the -- the label that it's an absurdity.  They 

tried to pursue that below, but nobody really 

argues that, takes it seriously here.  It's a 

policy argument.  It's a policy argument, and 

it's an imperfect one because one could

 one side.

 On the other side, "and" means "and,"

 plain language.  Everybody in the room does

 understand that concept.

 Number two, there is a distributive --

 examples elsewhere in the statute.  (f)(2) is

 distributive, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, 

so Congress knows how to distribute when it 

wants to distribute. 

And then, three, lenity, which is the 

word that we dare not utter but which Chief 

Justice Marshall back in Wiltberger said 

applies before you get to things like 

legislative history and what Congress might 

have wanted and policy arguments. 

And the fact of the matter is, at the 

end of the day, what we're really talking about 

here is whether mandatory minimums send people 

away for lifes, life sentences, effectively, 

for many people, or whether the guidelines, 

which are not exactly the most 

defendant-friendly form of sentencing known to 

man, themselves apply.

 second --

MR. DVORETZKY:  "Context," I think, is

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then I have a

 raised by Justice Gorsuch's comment.

 On the fact question, how many

 individual uses or dosages is 141 grams of meth 

get you?  I mean, I'm sure you acknowledge meth 

is a serious problem in many communities in the 

United States. And what's your sense of 141 

grams? And the government can talk about this 

as well. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I -- I honestly 

don't have a sense to give you the answer to 

that question.  You could certainly imagine 

that being a relevant consideration taking into 

-- taken into account at sentencing, but I -- I 

can't quantify that for you. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then, on the 

sentencing guidelines, those are -- are not 

mandatory, correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  They -- they are --

they're not mandatory.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  So --

MR. DVORETZKY:  But --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- so the 

reference to the Sentencing Guidelines, a lot

 of judges would sentence under the Sentencing

 Guidelines in certain cases.  And that happens. 

I guess the broader point there is the reason

 they're mandatory minimums -- there are 

problems with them, as you identify, but I want 

to give you a chance to respond to the 

counterpoint, which is that Congress uses them 

on some circumstances because, with the 

hundreds and hundreds of federal district 

judges around the country, they think that some 

judges might sentence certain serious offenders 

to too light a sentence, and so they wanted to 

prevent that from happening in certain kinds of 

cases. 

So the discretion doesn't seem like a 

total answer to the concern that Congress would 

have about cases like this. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, of course, the 

government can and does appeal sentences when

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That -- that

 almost -- you -- you know and I know that 

almost never works, but what's your other

 argument then?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  I mean, I think that

 this goes back to the purpose of the First Step

 Act. This was a once-in-a-generation 

sentencing reform, passed in a bipartisan 

manner, signed by President Trump, where the 

motivating force here was to move away from 

mandatory minimums. 

Yes, it did -- Congress did not 

completely eliminate mandatory minimums from 

the U.S. Code.  If it had, we wouldn't have 

this case.  Congress chose this rather 

complicated First Step Act solution to the 

problem.  But the problem it was trying to 

solve was moving away from numerous instances 

of unfair and unjust mandatory minimums and 

giving district courts the discretion, which, 

by and large, overwhelmingly they exercise 

properly --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right. 

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- to take into 

account individual circumstances.

 very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Dvoretzky, I

 wanted to give you a chance to respond to the 

government's argument that lenity doesn't apply 

to a safety valve statute. So lenity clearly

 applies to penalty-imposing provisions, like 

sentencing -- like sentencing provisions, and 

so one could say, well that principle would say 

that, you know, this -- this statute is part of 

the sentence and so it applies, and I -- I 

assume that would be your answer, but I asked 

my law clerk if she could find any examples of 

situations like this.  You just told Justice 

Kavanaugh the point of the First Step Act was 

to afford relief. 

And so it actually feels more to me 

like the argument would be a remedial statute 

should be construed broadly, rather than 

lenity, which is like a harsh statute should be 

construed more narrowly.  So can you give any 

examples of situations in which lenity has 

applied to a situation like this?

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, as you said, 

Justice Barrett, lenity has applied to

 sentencing cases.  I'm not thinking of an 

example of a sentencing case where we're 

dealing with a safety valve kind of structure

 because, as my -- as part of my colloquy with 

Justice Kavanaugh, I was saying this was a 

convoluted way for Congress to do this.

 But either way you want to look at it, 

whether it is lenity in favor of the defendant, 

the defendant having to satisfy all three in 

order to be disqualified, or if you want to 

look at it as Congress wanted to grant broad 

relief here from mandatory minimums, so, 

therefore, we ought to construe "and" to mean 

"and" and not limit the class of defendants who 

are eligible for that broad relief, I think, 

either way, it leads you to the same 

conclusion. 

And, either way, Congress knows how to 

use "and" and "or."  It ought to be held to 

those ordinary meanings.  And if it were to 

disagree with this Court's decision in our 

favor, Congress is free to amend the statute. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. And then I

have one other question that's related to this

 surplusage argument.

 Do the guidelines use that phrase?  I

 mean, I don't -- I don't want to go toe to toe 

with Chief Judge Pryor on what the Sentencing

 Guidelines allow and not, but I'm having a hard

 time getting my mind around this because,

 intuitively, it does seem like the surplusage 

argument makes more sense, and it seems to me 

like the argument that you can have a 

three-point offense that doesn't earn criminal 

history points because it's too old seems like 

it's kind of bending over backwards to find a 

way to make it not superfluous. 

So, I mean, do the guidelines use that 

phrase, "three-point offense"? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  The -- the guidelines 

don't use the phrase "three-point offense," but 

I think you get there both from the statute and 

from the guidelines.  The statute itself draws 

this distinction.  In (f)(1)(A), it talks about 

a four-point criminal history total -- point 

total. But then it excludes a one-point 

offense. 

So the statute in (A) is -- is coming

-- is -- has this concept that you can have a

 one-point offense that actually doesn't count

 towards the criminal history total.  That

 understanding of a one-point offense then 

carries through to (B) and (C) for a

 three-point offense and two-point offense.

 The guidelines are consistent with

 that in a couple of respects.  One, as Chief

 Judge -- as Chief Judge Pryor said, the 

guidelines do use the term "offense" and they 

talk about sentences from offenses not 

counting.  That is what 4A1.2 does. 

And so the guidelines are really 

setting up an order of operations.  Under 

4A1.1, you assign points to a sentence based on 

its length.  Under 4A2, however, you then say 

that certain sentences and offenses don't 

count. And so the guidelines have that 

concept. 

Lastly, there's Note 3 to 4A2 which we 

highlight in our brief.  That confirms that the 

guidelines contemplate that points can be 

associated with an offense without being 

counted.  So, for purposes of the single 

sentence rule, the -- that -- that comment

gotten two points, it can still serve as a

 predicate for the career offender guidelines.

 That idea of an -- an offense that would have 

gotten two points if they had counted is this

 concept that Congress employed here in the

 statute.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So how many did

 Mr. Pulsifer have?  How many three-point 

offenses?  Because he -- well, I'll -- I'll 

just tell you.  Looking at the PCR -- I mean 

the PSR, I think he had two three-point 

offenses that counted, counted because they 

weren't stale, and then one that was too old. 

Is that correct? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  That -- I think that's 

right. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. But then he 

argued below that he only had two three-point 

offenses.  So he didn't make this argument that 

he had three three-point offenses, right? 

MR. DVORETZKY:  He didn't need to 

argue this one way or another.  What he -- what 

he needed to argue and did argue is that he 

didn't have a prior two-point violent offense.

Act wanted to do that -- I don't think anybody

 disputes that -- isn't it conceivable that

 Congress still just wanted to identify 

particular circumstances in which the mandatory 

minimum should apply on the basis of criminal 

history and they could do the -- that as 

narrowly as they wanted to, correct?

 MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes. That's right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I mean, right? 

Like, it just -- it doesn't seem to me to be 

anomalous that Congress picked out a particular 

circumstance, as you described it in your 

introduction, a situation in which a person had 

all three of these circumstances would be one 

in which Congress still intended for the 

mandatory minimum to apply. 

But, in other circumstances, even if 

they involve serious offenses, even if they 

involve, Congress was willing to allow for 

judges to have discretion under those 

circumstances to take into account what the 

guidelines would have said or whatever.

 right when we're only talking about (f)(1) as

 playing the initial gatekeeping role.  You

take Justice Barrett's point about that, but I 

do think the guidelines lead you to identify

 three-point offenses.

 But Congress could say:  Look, we're 

lifting the emphasis on criminal history.

 We're -- we -- this has been a problem, you

 know, keeping people -- the court from

 considering raising -- alleviating the

 mandatory minimums, so we're not going to have 

a focus on criminal history anymore. 

However, there could be a situation in 

which we want to make clear, because it's so 

borderline we can't trust district judges to 

necessarily apply the mandatory minimum in this 

particular circumstance, so let us make clear 

that if the person has four criminal history 

points or more, if they have a three-point 

offense in their background, and if they have a 

two-point offense that is violent, you still 

have to apply the mandatory minimum in that 

situation. 

I don't see that as, like, crazy or 

making the statute not make sense.

 different policy outcome, that really is at 

that point a policy debate.

 And if the government -- the other

 thing I would add is, if the government's view 

were correct that any of A, B, or C were

 independently disqualifying, you could have 

people disqualified as in the Lopez case, for 

example, for a 14-year-old offense for 

spray-painting a building.  That would be a --

a three-point offense.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. LIU: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

"And" is conjunctive in 3553(f)(1). 

The question is, what does "and" conjoin? 

It joins together three independently 

disqualifying conditions by distributing the 

phrase "does not have."  That's the only 

interpretation that avoids rendering the first 

subparagraph entirely redundant and the only 

interpretation that assigns (f)(1) a coherent 

gatekeeping role. 

What's inexplicable about Petitioner's 

reading is that it would disqualify only those

defendants with a rare combination of 

characteristics, including a prior violent 

offense of exactly two points. So a defendant 

convicted of a violent offense would actually 

prefer to receive a longer sentence worth three

 points to avoid being disqualified.  That makes

 no sense.

          Petitioner's counterarguments fall 

into three buckets. First, he argued in his 

brief that the distributive interpretation is 

textually impermissible.  But grammar, usage, 

and legal drafting guides say otherwise, and 

the law is filled with distributive uses of 

"and." Petitioner this morning attempts to 

distinguish these as -- as cases involving 

negative conditions, but that's just a 

distinction without a difference. 

Second, Petitioner argues that the 

distributive use of "and" is less common.  But, 

according to leading grammar authorities, "and" 

is usually distributive, including when 

combined with the negative.  And even if that 

weren't true, even if, for example, 40 percent 

of the "ands" in the world were distributive, 

the job of the interpreter would be to figure

out whether, in context, this case falls within 

that 40 percent rather than to simply accept

 Petitioner's reading.

 Third and finally, Petitioner argues

 that Congress could have more clearly expressed 

the government's interpretation by using "or." 

But Congress could have more clearly expressed 

Petitioner's interpretation by, for example, 

using the phrase "does not have at least one of 

the following."  And if Congress had used "or," 

you can bet that defendants would be accusing 

the government of reading "or" to mean "and" by 

requiring that defendants not have A, not have 

B, and not have C. 

In any event, this Court has held that 

the mere possibility of a clearer phrasing 

can't defeat a meaning that's clear in context. 

Because "and" in context joins together three 

independently disqualifying conditions, the 

Eighth Circuit should be affirmed. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

MR. LIU: Well, the answer is it

 depends.  It depends on the context.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, see, that's the

 problem.  We're not getting direction or 

guidance as to when it depends. The -- it's

 almost as though this is a substantive due 

process of the word "and," that we just make it

 up as we go along.

 I -- I -- I think you have to give us 

more than that.  At least Petitioner says the 

natural -- the more natural reading or almost a 

default reading is "and" is conjunctive in a --

in a joint sense. 

MR. LIU: Yeah. Well, if you look at 

the grammar books, they say the opposite.  They 

say, when "and" is used, even when combined 

with a negative -- this is "The Cambridge 

Grammar of the English Language" -- they say 

"and" is more often distributive.  So I think 

that that's a fair starting point. 

But then I think you do need to look 

at the context of the statute.  "And" -- "and" 

is a relationship word.  It's a word that 

connects other words.  So you can't just look 

up "and" in the dictionary in isolation to know

what it connects. The only way to figure out 

what it connects is to actually read the other

 words around "and" in this statute.

 And, here, we think we have two

 extremely strong contextual indicators that 

Congress here intended "and" to be

 distributive.  One is our surplusage argument, 

and the other is the argument that if you adopt

 Petitioner's reading, the -- the provision 

doesn't make any sense. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: What about the use 

of "and" at the end of 3553(f)?  I mean, if 

you're right, then is it the government's 

position that (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) are 

also distributive? 

MR. LIU: No. We think "and" is doing 

the same work in both places.  In the main list 

of things, (f)(1) through (5), what "and" is 

doing is creating an eligibility checklist. 

The Court must find (1), must find (2), must 

find (3), must find (4), must -- and must find 

(5). 

What it's doing is the exact same

In both places, it's requiring that 

all the criteria be satisfied.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But only if you put 

in "must not have" three times. In other

 words, if you don't repeat "must not have," 

then it seems to me that one is saying that the 

defendant does not have all of those three.

 MR. LIU: That's true.  Our whole --

our whole case depends on whether you 

distribute the "does not have" or you don't. 

What I'm saying is, if you apply --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, what do you --

MR. LIU: -- the same --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- what do you say 

about the fact that we have within this 3553 --

and I'm looking at (f)(4) now -- a circumstance 

in which Congress has repeated, you know, the 

defendant "was not an organizer" and "was not 

engaged in?"  So wouldn't we have expected for 

Congress to do that same sort of thing if it 

meant for these things to be distributed in 

(1)?

 is formatting and style.

 What Congress did in (f)(1) was say:

 Look, (A), (B), and (C) are pretty long.  I

 mean, this would be a very long -- much longer

 than (f)(4).  And so, to help the reader figure 

out what the independent conditions are, we're

 going to split it up.

 But the principle --

Congress always used "and," and so we're trying 

to figure this out in that sense. 

MR. LIU: I think the only -- the only 

change is the criteria that -- that the author 

thought were being connected. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, there's a change

(C) should be read in a package because, when

 they're read as a -- as a single unit with

 brackets, then "or" makes sense.

Congress intended this to mean, and so it seems

 to me at least -- at least relevant what they 

had previously drafted as they looked at these

 various issues. 

MR. LIU: Yeah, I don't think so 

because, in the context of this case, everyone

 agrees -- I mean, we've been accused of this

 throughout the brief -- that the same thing can

 be rephrased as an "or."  So the fact that it 

was rephrased as an "or" I don't think moves 

the needle at all. 

Anytime someone is speaking and uses a 

connector, they have in mind what's being 

connected.  When they used "or," I would say 

that Congress --

the negative, such as 26 U.S.C. Section 17 --

 170(f)(16)(D), which provides that the term 

"household items" does not include food, 

paintings, antiques, and other objects of art,

 jewelry and gems, and collection.

framed in the negative and we distribute that 

negative the way you have. Point me to one 

other statute.

Then one defendant goes on to commit a series

The second defendant goes on to -- to -- to 

commit just one more offense, a mid-level

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Which is, when we're 

trying to figure out the most natural reading 

of a statute and whatever standard we talked 

about, what should we account for the fact that 

the government didn't make this argument until 

this Court in this case, that below, in the 

Eighth Circuit, it argued that "and" means 

"or"? You -- you started this argument by 

saying we agree "and" is conjunctive, but in 

the Eighth Circuit, the argument was it's 

disjunctive.

noticed in the government's brief was the 

insistence on inverting 4A1.1 and 1.2, which is 

actually not the way in which the guidelines 

operate.  You start with 1.1, which allows us 

to determine which prior sentences are eligible 

for points. You get three points for a certain 

set of characteristics; that is, the sentence 

is over one year and a month, you get two 

points, et cetera. 

Once you have identified those, then 

you go on to 4 -- 1.2 and determine which 

count, which of those count for the purpose of

 Now, if it were true that you look at 

4A1.1, you push it away, and then you subtract

 those points, it wouldn't make sense to build 

into the commentary for when you add them all

 understanding your response.  So I'm just

 wondering whether you can go over why you think 

the single sentence rule does not operate

 against you --

MR. LIU: Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- putting aside this 

-- the old sentence and the foreign -- the old 

conviction and the foreign conviction rule? 

MR. LIU: So -- so the single sentence 

rule in principle is the same as the foreign 

conviction and military conviction rule in that 

it tells you what is your baseline for adding 

points, for being the basis for adding points. 

And what the single sentence rule says 

is that when you have two sentences that are, 

say, charged on the same indictment and the 

defendant is sentenced on the same day, treat 

that, count that -- those are literal --

literal words -- count that as a single 

sentence. 

So then that's the basis on which you 

move to the instruction in 4A1.1, which says 

how many points to add.  So, when you combine 

those two, may -- maybe you get a sentence

that's three years instead of just one year.

 So then you know when you get to 4A1.1 we're 

going to add three points to that instead of 

just the regular old one or two.

 So that's how the single sentence rule 

operates. But the principle is the same, which 

is that you don't get to the point of adding

 points --

you're counting.

(1)(A) has all over it the word "add." And so 

there's no context in which, as I think Chief 

Judge Pryor was supposing, that points are 

assigned without adding them.  There's only --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I think she's 

talking about 3553(f)(1)(A), Judge Pryor --

MR. LIU: Oh, (f)(1)(A). 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, (f)(1)(A). 

MR. LIU: Right.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mm-hmm.

 MR. LIU: There's an exclusion in the 

text of (f)(1)(A) that says we're going to

 exclude points resulting from one-point 

offenses.

 I don't see how that helps my friend 

because the negative implication of that is 

that all the two-point and three-point offenses

 are being included in the total points. 

And so that just reinforces that when 

you have a two-point violent offense and a 

three-point offense, that's not being excluded 

from the total, it's being included. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, but the fact 

that you could include or exclude is the 

problem.  In other words, just -- Judge Pryor's 

point is Congress understood that there would 

be offenses that are called one-point offenses, 

are called two- or three-point offenses that 

would not be included.  And that undermines 

your point because your surplusage argument 

relies on the view that every three-point 

offense is only such because it is counted. 

So, to the extent that you can have a 

world in which something is a one-point

 least says that I think that -- sorry, he says

 that that means that you're wrong about

 surplusage.

 MR. LIU: I -- I don't -- I don't 

think this helps my friend's argument at all. 

In fact, I think it cuts against it.  If you 

read the exclusion, it says points resulting

 from one-point offenses. 

So the only offenses it has in mind 

are -- are offenses that would actually --

actually result in points.  What -- the problem 

with Chief Justice Pryor -- Chief Judge Pryor's 

vision is, is that there are some offenses out 

there that would have resulted in points but 

for the fact that they're not counted. 

The text of -- of -- of 3553(f)(1)(A) 

doesn't contemplate that.  The only one-point 

offenses it contemplates are one-point offenses 

that actually --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But what is the 

government's position on that?  Do you disagree 

that there's a world in which you -- you have 

an offense that would be assigned points, but 

those points aren't counted for the purpose of

 circumstances where the context establishes

 that that's the better reading.

 MR. LIU: Correct.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But is there a

 more precise phrasing you can put on that?  The

 context shows what?

 MR. LIU: Sure. And I -- I think

 Justice Kagan provided a helpful heuristic.  We

 read things like "don't drink and drive" 

because there is something special about the 

combination of drinking and driving.  It is 

particularly harmful.  And so we're telling 

people don't do the two in combination. 

The problem here is that there is 

nothing special about the combination of A, B, 

and C except for its arbitrariness. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But the premise to 

your point, I think -- and this is important 

and Justice Thomas raised it -- is the "and" 

distributes sometimes. 

MR. LIU: Correct. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's an 

established rule, so we just have to figure out 

when it is.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then, on 

context, I think Justice Gorsuch has raised

 important questions about policy, so you want 

to distinguish the context that we should look 

at from policy arguments, or how do we -- how 

do you respond to the concern that those are

 just policy arguments and not relevant to the

 context, particularly the anomaly --

the number of offenders who would be 

disqualified now. 

MR. LIU: I want to make clear that 

our con -- our second contextual argument is 

completely consistent with textualism.  It's 

consistent in three ways. 

First, we're not arguing that purpose 

should trump text. We are trying to figure out 

as between two textually grammatically possible 

readings which one is the best one in light of 

context. 

Second, we are not deriving purpose 

from the subjective views of the legislature. 

We are deriving purpose from what a reasonably 

objective user of words would glean from the

 narrower.  It's about a line, any line, that

 makes sense.

intent, Congress couldn't have intended this, 

wouldn't have intended this because it wouldn't 

want bad people to get away, or, two, it's a

 happen.

 And either of those seem to me

 straining at least your -- your claim that this 

is all consistent with textualism, especially

 since you haven't identified a canon other than 

absurdity that would be kind of a classic 

textualist argument. 

MR. LIU: Well, with respect, Justice 

Gorsuch, I think we're relying on a traditional 

tool of construction that this Court relies on 

all the time. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Which is what?  It's 

called "common sense" in your brief.  I don't 

know that canon, but I guess it's a -- a good 

one. 

MR. LIU: It's called construing the 

structure and the text of the statute, gleaning 

the evident purpose --

not. And then, in figuring that out, the

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- I think, what

 Justice Gorsuch is zeroing in on.

 MR. LIU: I -- I think it has to be --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That sounds like

 absurdity when you're bringing context.  But

 maybe it being absurd is helpful to or close to

 absurd is helpful in thinking about context.

 MR. LIU: Well, I think this is the 

way the Court has approached other cases.  Take 

last term's decision in Jones versus Hendrix. 

The Court there was construing 2255's saving 

clause, and one of the indicators of context 

that it relied on was the fact that the 

defendant's reading would mean that 

non-constitutional claims, i.e. statutory 

claims, would be given a superior remedy than 

constitutional claims.  The Court rejected that 

because it called that result "strange and 

bizarre." 

In Abbott versus the United States, 

which -- which we discuss in our brief, this 

Court addressed the applicability of 924(c)'s 

mandatory consecutive sentence regime.  Under 

defendant's reading in that case, the most

 is textually permissible.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But less -- less

 likely?

 MR. LIU: Less likely according to

 them, but I think the -- the job of a faithful 

interpreter is to figure out whether -- you 

know, if it's an 80 to 20 percent split or a 70

 to 30, 60/40, the faithful interpreter needs to 

figure out are we in the 20 percent, are we in 

the 30 percent, are we in the 40 percent, or 

are we in the other -- in the other box?  It 

would -- it would be to tolerate a huge error 

rate if the Court simply assumed that because 

70 percent of "ands" out there are joint, we're 

just going to read every -- every "and" in the 

world as joint.  That would be a 30 percent 

error rate. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I looked at 

the Senate's manual, the Senate's legislative 

drafting manual, and it says, "in a statement 

in the negative, 'or' is almost always the 

correct word."  And I think that's what the 

linguistic brief is telling us. 

You're putting it at 20, 30, or 20.

-- too far on this, the alternatives are not 

that the worst criminals are going to get a

 safety valve because, as -- if someone has all 

three of this, one could view the Senate as 

saying this is what disqualifies you only. 

That would be the worst in this -- the eyes of

 the Senate.  You have to have (A), (B), and 

(C).

MR. LIU: No. To -- to be clear, our

point is "and" is inherently contextual.  It 

has to be contextual because it is a word that

 connects other words together.  So the only way

 to figure out what it's connecting is to read

 those other words in context.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or it would mean 

the same thing all the time.

 MR. LIU: But, to get back to Justice

 Barrett's question about the -- or I -- or I 

won't. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can answer 

her question. 

MR. LIU: I was just going to finish 

my -- my answer to her question about the 

corpus linguistics brief.  And I think the 

other two points, just to round out my answer, 

are that I think that brief itself acknowledges 

that context matters. 

On page 7, it gives an example of the 

phrase "don't take drugs and alcohol."  And the 

meaning of that changes depending on which 

context you're saying it. And the fact that 

they can't rule out a -- a distributive reading 

for 124 of the 125 statutes they studied also 

indicates that context matters.

 And the last point I'll make on the 

corpus linguistics brief is that the brief then 

stops short of actually looking at context.

 This is also on pages 6 and 7. They say,

 that's beyond the purview of this brief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Thomas, anything further? 

Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  This case, to me, 

raises a lot of general questions that may not 

dictate a decision one way or the other, but on 

this last point about the corpus linguistics 

brief, we have -- I -- I think this is a -- a 

very promising tool, but I don't know that we 

have decided how it can legitimately play a 

role in our statutory interpretation cases.  I 

mean, this is an empirical fact that is being 

introduced into the case in an amicus brief. 

What guidance would you give us about 

the propriety of our relying on that? 

MR. LIU: Yeah, I think the Court 

needs to proceed with caution when presented 

with evidence like this, just like it's 

presented with evidence of any other sort of 

scientific study.

I think, in the context of statutory

 interpretation, we are trying to figure out 

what a reasonably objective user of words would 

-- would understand a text to mean.  And often 

we think of ourselves as occupying that role. 

And so empirical studies aren't necessarily

 helpful because we can just -- we can just

 introspectively think about what that 

reasonably objective user of words would 

understand. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I have no reason 

to think this was not a study done under the 

highest -- in accordance with the highest 

criteria, but it is an interesting question,

 legal drafting books already say.  So it's

 simply reinforcing what -- what other sources 

are saying about the meaning of these words.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  On another point, do

 you think the absurdity canon is about anything

 other than intent?

 MR. LIU: I -- I think it is partly

 based on this assumption that Congress is a 

rational and intelligent drafter of -- of 

statutes, and so, when we see a result that is 

absurd, we presume that that is not one 

Congress meant to embrace. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's an intent that's 

attributed to Congress.  We -- we assume that 

they do not intend to write something that's 

absurd. 

MR. LIU: Correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right?  So it is about 

-- it is about intent? 

MR. LIU: Correct.  It's -- it's -- it 

-- it is about intent, and it's -- it's -- it's 

intent against the backdrop of a body, 

Congress, that we presume objectively to be 

reasonable.

JUSTICE ALITO:  And if that is the

 case, why would we draw a bright line between 

absolute absurdity and mere absurdity?

 MR. LIU: I don't think this Court's

 there are two textually or grammatically 

possible readings, the Court quite often tries 

to make sense, rather than nonsense, of the

 corpus juris, and that is a perfectly 

legitimate way, as Scalia and Garner say, of 

resolving this sort of statutory problem.

Sotomayor?

your point that there are two grammatically 

permissible ways of understanding this, and I

At the same time, I think 

Mr. Dvoretzky has a point of his own, which is 

that notwithstanding that there are two 

grammatically permissible ways of understanding 

this, that our -- that the most natural way of

"or." I would say it's sort of the most 

natural way and also the way that prevents any

 confusion.  You know, we wouldn't be sitting 

here if Congress had used the word "or."

 So, in a context in which a

 defendant's liberty is on the line, where --

I'm just going to assume that the Rule of

 Lenity applies, notwithstanding your argument. 

Why isn't that enough to get to Mr. Dvoretzky's 

position? 

MR. LIU: I think because it's at most 

just one more -- the fact that "or" might have 

been a clearer way to express this, I think, at 

most, that's just one more context --

contextual consideration that you put into the 

balance. 

And if you care about the 

"unusualness" of using "and" instead of "or," 

well, then I -- I think what's even more 

unusual are the problems with Petitioner's 

reading.  What's even more unusual than 

distributive use of "and" is the fact that the 

very first subparagraph is surplusage and the 

fact that this provision isn't going to be a 

coherent measure of a defendant's criminal

 So, to the extent we are kind of 

weighing unusualness against unusualness, I

 think there's just a -- maybe just a little bit 

of unusualness here. I'm not really even 

willing to concede that given what the books

 say.

 But let's say you think there's a

 little bit of unusualness in using "and."  It's 

far outweighed by the unusualness of just 

striking out an entire subparagraph and 

rendering the rest incoherent. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In the unusualness 

question, the government may have alluded to 

this conjunctive distribution theory in its 

Eighth Circuit brief, but, really, it argued 

that it was disjunctive and that "and" can mean 

"or." That was the thrust of its brief.  I've 

got it in front of me. 

That's certainly how the Eighth 

Circuit understood the government's argument 

below. They said -- they -- they said that

"The parties discuss whether 'and' should be 

read conjunctively or disjunctively, but we do 

not believe that is the important question." 

The government also argued the "and" 

versus "or" theory in Lopez in -- in front of

 the Ninth Circuit.  That's in its brief there

 too. And I -- I -- I understand that this is

 a -- a refined position and -- with the benefit 

of the Solicitor General's office. And that --

that's great.  And the government's entitled to 

make whatever arguments it wants. 

But, when we're looking for plain 

meaning, what ordinary people would understand 

words to mean, isn't that some evidence that 

the government itself took this long to really 

figure out this particular theory? 

MR. LIU: I don't -- I don't -- I 

think it actually kind of proves the opposite. 

I mean, the government looked at this from the 

beginning, and the idea that A, B, and C are 

independently disqualifying was clear as day. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  On the basis of a 

completely different theory, that "and" means 

"or," which you in your first sentence as you 

got up, you said it's conjunctive before us.

 disjunctive.  And that's a difference.  It's a

 difference.

JUSTICE GORSUCH: And the government 

of the United States has a lot of resources, 

and the average criminal defendant doesn't.

 They're one-off players, you're a repeat 

player, and you've got a very sophisticated 

reticulated third theory of the possible 

meaning of the word "and," right? We're now up 

to three. 

And the fact that it took so long to 

get to the third, what do we do with that? 

MR. LIU: I -- I acknowledge that 

there were different theories, one relying on 

"and," one relying on "or" that were advanced 

in the lower courts.  I think that just 

reflects what is a well-accepted principle that 

any phrase, a negative statement involving 

"and" can be rephrased as a negative statement 

involving "or."

 alternative arguments.  One way is to read the

 "and" as distributive.  The other way, if -- if 

you want to go that route, is to read the "and"

 to mean an "or."  But the bottom line of both 

-- of both interpretations were, as -- as the

 bargain's theorem shows, logically equivalent.

 reject the "or" theory as -- as incorrect at 

this stage? You've not pursued it at any rate?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I appreciate that

 "and" can sometimes mean "or," but this is not 

a conversation. This is a statute, and it's a 

criminal statute with huge implications for the

 lives and well-being of the people who come

 through the system. 

And so I guess what I'm trying to

 understand is why the imprecision in this 

statute, the fact that you say that there are 

two textually grammatically possible readings. 

Why doesn't that count against the 

government?  Justice Kagan said, I'm going to 

assume lenity applies.  Can you help me 

understand why it wouldn't? 

MR. LIU: It wouldn't for two reasons. 

I'll just say the first one briefly, but I --

I'll skip over it after saying it.  We don't 

think this is the type of penal law to which 

lenity applies. 

Now, if you think this is the type of

the definition of penal law that this Court has

 embraced, and it goes all the way back to

 Blackstone, encompasses laws that define a

 crime or that increase or impose a punishment.

 And this provision here does neither.

 It relieves defendants of punishment.  It is a

 congressional act of lenity.  And this Court

 has never applied the Rule of Lenity --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you -- you -- you 

reject -- even though it has to do with 

punishment and the implications of it vary 

dramatically depending -- your -- the level of 

punishment that a defendant can get varies 

dramatically depending upon whether or not it 

applies, you say lenity is not a relevant or a 

thing that we should consider? 

MR. LIU: Correct.  This Court has 

never applied the Rule of Lenity to this type 

of statute.  It would be an extension of the 

Rule of Lenity to a new context. 

I would analogize this sort of 

provision to say a statute that sets forth an 

affirmative defense.  An affirmative defense to 

the substantive prohibition of a crime --

 terms of your penalty presumably if you -- if 

you get it versus you don't.

 MR. LIU: Right. I mean --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So it can harm the

 MR. LIU: It's certainly true that the

 defendant prefers one reading over the other. 

But the type of -- what -- what the Rule of 

Lenity cares about is the type of provision 

we're talking about and whether it fits the 

category of being penal.  And a penal 

sentencing provision is one that imposes a 

punishment or increases it.  This one doesn't 

do either.  It can only go down. 

Now the reason why we apply lenity in 

the first context is because we want to be sure 

before a defendant is made worse off that 

that's what Congress intended and the defendant 

had fair notice. 

But, when the only direction the 

sentence can go is down, those -- those 

provisions --

MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'd 

like to start out with your question about 

whether Congress focuses on grammar.  I think 

we have to assume that Congress focuses on 

grammar.  Congress as a speaker does not get 

the benefit of colloquialisms.  It's not the --

there's no conversation that people are having 

with Congress in the way that you do with a 

doctor or somebody else.

Court has with Congress by interpreting its

 words to mean what they say, and if Congress 

disagrees, it can carry on its part of the

 conversation by changing the statute.

 Otherwise, what we end up in is a

 guessing game about whether Congress might have

 meant this policy or that policy.

 Instead, the Court should give 

Congress clear rules of the road. And, in 

fact, the Court should -- should instruct 

Congress to follow its own rules of the road, 

namely, the Senate Drafting Manual, which in 

this case would have called for the use of the 

word "or" if Congress meant a distributive 

meaning. 

With respect to Mr. Liu's point that 

"and" is distributive in grammar books, the 

government has not come up with any examples of 

"and" in a negated conjunction in the U.S. 

Code. "Reading Law" tells us that when you 

have the formulation that someone must not have 

A, B, and C, that means all three. 

The corpus linguistics study supports 

that conclusion, that if you had "or" there, it 

would be perfectly clear, and using "and" there

to express a distributive meaning is unnatural.

 The -- the -- the government's best 

example of a statute is the household items 

provision in the Tax Code. First of all, as 

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, that says "does

 not include," so it's giving -- it's setting

 forth a list of examples rather than criteria.

 Second, just looking at what it's 

talking about, food, paintings, antiques, other 

objects of art, jewelry and gems, there is 

simply no way to combine those things, right? 

There is no -- there is no such thing as edible 

antique jewelry.  It -- it -- it's beyond 

absurd to think that there would be. 

Here, it is not absurd to say that 

Congress could have required (A), (B), and (C) 

in combination.  The government has policy 

arguments for why Congress might not have 

wanted that, but it's not absurd to think that 

it did. 

With respect to the policy, if you had 

an individual defendant who had, let's say, two 

violent -- previous violent offenses in -- in 

addition to the current drug offense, that 

would make that defendant a career offender.

And if you walk through the guidelines, you end 

up with a guidelines range for an offense level 

of 34 for someone like that and a criminal 

history category of 6, which is 262 to 327 

months. That is a serious long sentence.

 In addition, if you look at the 

Sentencing Commission's 2022 data, there were

 approximately 20,000 drug offenders.  About 

1,000 of them, so around 5 percent, were career 

offenders. 

Taking those two points together, what 

that tells us is that you can have -- you will 

have long sentences for the rare recidivist 

that we've spent a lot of time talking today as 

somebody who might somehow satisfy (f)(1). 

It's entirely sensible that that is not what 

Congress was focused on when it was seeking to 

broaden discretionary sentencing and move away 

from mandatory minimums. 

Lastly, with respect to common sense, 

the government focuses a lot on common sense, 

but it's common sense that if Congress wanted 

to say "or," it would have said "or."  It knew 

how to do that in other parts of this very 

sentence, of 3553(f).  The -- Congress's own

Official 

drafting manual says to do so, and that would

 be the ordinary meaning -- that would be the

 ordinary term to use in order to express the 

meaning that the government attributes to this

 statute.

 The Court should again hold the court 

to the ordinary meaning of the terms that it 

chose, and it's important to do that because, 

again, this is a -- this is a criminal statute 

where fairness is at stake.  Whether you view 

that as lenity or whether you view that as the 

-- the breadth of a remedial statute, there's 

fairness at stake and there's somebody's 

liberty at stake.  And if Congress wants to use 

-- Congress needs to use terms clearly in order 

to get the benefit of the government's 

interpretation here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

counsel.  The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the case 

was submitted.)
