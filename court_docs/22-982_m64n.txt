 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-982, Thornell

 versus Jones.

 Mr. Lewis.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON D. LEWIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LEWIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The Ninth Circuit erred in two 

critical ways. First, it failed to give any 

deference to the district court's factual 

determinations.  After hearing the evidence and 

testimony at the evidentiary hearing, the 

district court made factual findings as to 

whether Jones suffered from specific mental 

conditions and whether those conditions caused 

him to murder Robert and Tisha Weaver.  The 

Ninth Circuit disregarded those findings, 

instead substituting its own judgment. 

My friend defends this error by 

positing that the district court's only role was 

to determine whether unpresented mitigation 

evidence existed.  This view eviscerates the --

the traditional role of trial courts in the

 fact-finding process and would radically change

 habeas practice, resulting in far more writs

 undoing state sentences.

 The Ninth Circuit further erred by 

failing to meaningfully consider the aggravating

 evidence or its weight.  Strickland does not

 allow for a sentence to be undone whenever there 

is some new mitigation that addresses moral 

culpability.  Instead, it requires a reasonable 

probability that the new mitigation would have 

changed the sentence in light of the balance 

between the total mitigation and the aggravating 

evidence.  The Ninth Circuit's approach is 

contrary to this longstanding test and must be 

rejected. 

I urge this Court to reverse the Ninth 

Circuit's judgment, clarify the applicability of 

clear error review in the Strickland context, 

and reaffirm the principle that a Strickland 

prejudice determination requires a reviewing 

court to reweigh both the total mitigation and 

the aggravation. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

simply by saying that de novo review is

 improper?

 MR. LEWIS: I think so, Your Honor.

 You know, in my friend's responsive brief, he 

argues that Village Lakeside stands for the 

proposition that these types of mixed questions

 addressing constitutional issues are totally de

 novo. I think there's more room in the 

Strickland question than that and specifically 

in the Strickland prejudice context. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, I don't 

think I understand your answer. 

There's no dispute that the court 

below did not -- I'm not talking the federal 

court. The state court never reached the 

prejudice prong, correct? 

MR. LEWIS: We haven't raised that 

issue, Your Honor, no. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  And you're 

not raising it now? 

MR. LEWIS: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're accepting 

that de novo review with respect to the 

prejudice prong is correct at least for purposes 

of this argument?

 not AEDPA deference that you're seeking?

 MR. LEWIS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Okay. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You're -- just to 

clarify, you're saying that there's de novo 

review in the district court, not de novo review 

on appeal? 

MR. LEWIS: There's de novo review of 

the district court's -- the district court made 

a prejudice determination, and we haven't raised 

the question of whether the state court made a 

prejudice determination and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah. 

MR. LEWIS: -- that judgment was 

entitled to deference under AEDPA.

MR. LEWIS: We're asserting that that 

determination would be reviewed de novo as to

 the legal question in the Strickland inquiry. 

But, on the factual question of the mixed 

question, then those factual determinations are 

entitled to clear error deference under Rule 52 

and this Court's precedents.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming we accept 

your argument that the court below didn't weigh 

the aggravating and mitigating factors, you're 

asking us for a reversal.  Why isn't a vacate 

and remand appropriate? 

MR. LEWIS: I think concepts of 

finality would dictate that the circuit court 

has had this case for so long and has spent so 

much time granting relief on certain issues, 

reserving other ones, and then having it sent 

back continuously, it has to end at some point. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's nice, but 

we're not fact finders, and we generally don't 

weigh evidence.  There's thousands of pages in 

this record.

-- I understand the basis of your argument.  The

it failed to weigh are usually given great 

weight --

MR. LEWIS: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- under Arizona 

law. So -- but that still -- I could accept 

that they didn't weigh them the way they're 

supposed to.  Why are you asking us to do that? 

I think that that's something that shouldn't --

isn't better practice for us to tell the court 

what it's supposed to do so it gets it right the 

next time? 

MR. LEWIS: Yes, Your Honor, I think 

so, and I think that's what this Court did in 

Wong v. Belmontes. We've just asked for sort of

aggravating evidence is so compelling and the 

mitigating evidence that was developed in the 

federal evidentiary hearing is -- is so slight.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, really?  I

 mean, let me just mention one, the head

 injuries.  The original sentencing court knew of 

two or three head injuries. In none of them was 

there proof that the defendant had gone 

unconscious as there was in the new evidence 

that was develop that when I think he was -- if 

I don't -- if -- the facts are close to this. 

If I don't get the details right, please forgive 

me. 

MR. LEWIS: Sure, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I -- you can 

correct me if I'm wrong -- that at five years 

old, he fell, went unconscious.  His mother 

found him just waking up.  In another incident, 

he fell on his head on a metal roof and taken to 

the hospital and there was brain swelling. 

Don't you think that those facts are 

sufficiently more serious than what was 

presented at first and would have shown greater

there was neurological damage from this number

 MR. LEWIS: Yes, Your Honor.  I -- I

Jones was five years old and fell off the swing

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I do know that 

some of the incidents were introduced at trial 

by Dr. Potts but that the more serious ones were

 found on habeas review and after a more detailed

 mitigation examination by the experts.

 MR. LEWIS: Sure.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The ones showing 

his unconscious nature and the brain swelling.

 MR. LEWIS: And so, even -- even 

assuming that those incidents happened and that 

that information was only introduced 

post-sentence, the district court's findings 

about the credibility of Jones's expert 

witnesses are compelling and entitled to 

deference because the head injury alone isn't 

really dispositive of anything.  It just says 

that Jones fell and hit his head and he lost 

consciousness and there may have been some 

swelling in these things. 

But, without the underlying expert 

opinions to explain why that affected Jones and 

why that affected his conduct at the time of the 

crimes, it's not as compelling of mitigation as 

it would be otherwise.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So I 

read the circuit court here as saying that's 

what the district court did or how it erred, not 

in ignoring the credibility determinations, et 

cetera, but in requiring more proof than the law

 required.  Even under Arizona law, for example, 

it says you don't need to prove a nexus between 

the injury and the crime. That's what -- I'm --

I have Tennard, T-E-N-N-A-R-D.  It's a -- it's a 

Arizona case that says you don't need to prove 

that connection. 

MR. LEWIS: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  So 

what the -- I read the Ninth Circuit as saying 

is the court applied the wrong standard.  It 

might want to give it less weight in the 

calculus, but that's not what it did.  It set a 

legal standard that said you had to show 

conclusively that it was present. 

MR. LEWIS: I -- I don't think the 

district court ever purported to say that it was 

refusing to consider any of this evidence for 

what it was worth.  What we had here for --

Jones did not present "evidence confirming that

head trauma or other factors." I don't see how

 that's not requiring positive proof.

 MR. LEWIS: I think you can split it 

up. So the district court, when it was faced 

with conflicting experts on specified diagnoses,

 said, I have to figure out what's true and

 what's not true. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: Except that's not 

what we've said in Porter.  I mean, I'm sort of 

picking up on Justice Sotomayor's point here. 

This Court appears to have looked at a similar 

situation and said, you know, even -- I'm 

talking about the Porter case. 

MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Even though the 

state's experts identified problems with the 

defendant's expert testimony, it was not 

reasonable for the court, the district court, to 

discount entirely the effect that this testimony 

might have had on the jury and the sentencing 

judge. 

So I take that to mean that the -- the 

responsibility or the role of the district court 

is to see that there's mitigating evidence there

and, in the ultimate weighing perhaps, take into

 account whether the -- the district court thinks 

something is more or less credible as it weighs 

it against the aggravating evidence.

 But to discount it, to say I'm not 

going to look at it because you haven't proven 

or whatever, seems like a problem with the

 district court's analysis.

 MR. LEWIS: Sure.  So two points about 

that. If -- if I'm remembering Porter 

correctly, I think what you had there wasn't the 

same sort of battle of experts that you had here 

because, in Porter, I believe the state's 

experts said that they couldn't agree on whether 

or not it would establish the sort of statutory 

mitigating circumstance. 

So I think it's much different when 

you have experts that are saying categorically 

no, Jones does not suffer from cognitive 

impairment or PTSD, and the district court is 

forced to decide which account of Jones's mental 

condition is more accurate.

could be a problem with the district court's

 these credibility findings under circumstances 

in which it isn't clear that the district court

So it feels like one step more you -- you want

 us to establish here.

 MR. LEWIS: Sure.  And -- and, you

the -- the district court still considered the 

evidence establishing the foundation of all of 

these specified diagnoses. 

For instance, the district court 

considered the impact of Jones's alleged further 

physical and sexual abuse, but the district 

court didn't give it very much weight because, 

as the district court saw it, Jones wasn't a 

credible reporter for that history --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, isn't it

 possible that the district court misunderstood 

its role here? And this doesn't at all go to 

the question of whether the court of appeals

 might have also misunderstood its role.

 But just focusing on the district 

court for a moment, that the district court 

seemed to think that it was the fact finder in 

this case and using a kind of 

preponderance-of-the- evidence standard, did you 

show this, did you show that, you know, by 

51 percent. 

MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I don't think that 

that's what the reasonable probability asks a 

district court to do. I mean, if you were just 

to put some artificial numbers on this, suppose 

that there was enough evidence in mitigation 

that a court could say something like, I don't 

know, there's like a 30 percent chance that this 

might have affected the way the original 

sentencer would have decided. 

MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm.

the fact finder, I find you haven't met your

 burden.

 MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, as I understand

 what we've asked district courts to do in this

 special Strickland area, it's basically to ask a 

different kind of question which does not give

 you a 51 percent threshold.  It just says, you 

know, if there's some kind of chance, it might 

be 30 percent or it might be 25 percent or 

whatever it is --

MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that the district 

court -- that the original sentencer would have 

done something differently, then I'm supposed to 

give it back to the original sentencer. 

So that's where I think it -- it looks 

to me as though the district court misunderstood 

its role, and I'm wondering what the answer to 

that is. 

MR. LEWIS: I mean, it's -- it's

 like a very natural thing for the district court

 to have done.  I'm a fact finder.  I'm going to 

say you're credible; you're not. You've met

 your 51 percent burden; you haven't.  But this 

is a special context where we -- we actually

 have said that that's not the right inquiry.

court, when confronted with the conflicting 

evidence on specified diagnoses, did what it had 

to do to separate truth from fiction.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, can I ask

 you about the evidentiary hearing in the -- in 

the first place? I've been trying to figure out 

because this case has a long procedural history, 

and the state isn't challenging this, I 

understand, but I just want to understand the 

rationale for it. 

Why -- do you think the district court 

was right to conduct an evidentiary hearing and 

take in the extra evidence?  Because, you know, 

2254(e)(2) requires the court to find two things 

before the -- the new evidence is taken in, and 

one is "a factual predicate that could not have 

been previously discovered through the exercise 

of due diligence and" -- that was what the Ninth 

Circuit found -- and -- and, B, "the facts 

underlying the claim would be sufficient to 

establish by clear and convincing evidence that 

but for the constitutional error, no reasonable 

fact finder would have found the applicant 

guilty of the underlying offense."

MR. LEWIS: Sure.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Was that correct,

MR. LEWIS: Well, this was a -- a 

pre-Pinholster evidentiary hearing. So I

thereabouts, if I'm remembering correctly.  I --

I can't give the reasons for why --

 time when the court granted the hearing in 2003,

correct standard. I think you agree that the

 standard?

 MR. LEWIS: Sure.  Yeah.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And then 

they say, reweighing the evidence in aggravation

 against the total -- totality of the mitigating

 evidence, they conclude that the mitigating

 evidence outweighs.  But the important part, I

 think, is that they go on to say:  This 

conclusion is supported by the Strickland 

prejudice analysis conducted by the Supreme 

Court and our court in similar cases. 

MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And then they go 

through case after case after case, identifying 

an aggravating factor that is similar to the one 

in this case and explaining how, in that case, 

the court, whether it's this Court or another 

court, found it to be outweighed by similar 

mitigating evidence. 

So why --

MR. LEWIS: Well, first, you know,

 there's -- there's no ascription by the circuit 

court of any type of weight to the aggravating 

circumstances. So what we have here is the 

district court making the first de novo review 

of the prejudice question. It wasn't made in

 state court.  We haven't raised that here.  The 

district court's the first one to make it. And 

the district court ascribes great weight to the 

aggravating circumstances present here. 

The Ninth Circuit doesn't rebut that 

at all, and they don't make any comment on the 

actual weight of those aggravating circumstances 

to give some context for how it's actually being 

weighed. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you're saying 

they have to speak direct -- because what I see

 MR. LEWIS: Yeah.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right?  Because then

 we -- we see them not even grappling with the 

idea of weighing. But it looks like they've 

gone through and they've said, okay, let's find

 other cases where similar aggravating factors

 have been present --

MR. LEWIS: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- and mitigating 

factors were not presented and what did the 

court say in the -- in those situations and --

and this one is similar.  I -- I guess you're --

you're saying that the error here is that they 

had to have an additional paragraph in which 

they directly said, and so the district court 

got it wrong or --

MR. LEWIS: You know, I think that's 

possible because that's the last thing we have 

in the record that actually ascribes any sort of 

weight to the aggravating circumstances.  And if 

you read Judge Bennett's dissent, you see what 

we would be looking for in that type of 

situation.

cites, you know, we were dealing with AEDPA

 review of a state court determination.  And when

 you think about Williams v. Taylor, you know,

 this Court is saying that the state court

 correct -- correctly emphasized the strength of 

the prosecution evidence supporting the future

 dangerousness to aggravating circumstance.  Even 

a sentence like that shows that the court has 

assigned some weight to an aggravating 

circumstance and considered it in some way. 

But we don't have that here.  We just 

have a bare recitation that aggravating 

circumstances were found, that they existed, but 

the court focused solely on the weight of the 

new mitigating evidence.  And I think that 

demonstrates that they didn't consider what 

Strickland calls for them to consider, which is 

the balance between the total mitigation and the 

aggravation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you 

mentioned, I think, in -- in your opening if I'm 

remembering correctly, that one thing we should 

do today is clarify the legal standards that are

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you 

want us to say that we haven't said already?

 MR. LEWIS: You know, I -- I do think

 that this Court in Strickland was -- was clear

 that, you know, there's a factual component to 

this inquiry and that the legal questions are 

whether there was deficient performance and

 whether there was prejudice from such deficient

 performance. 

But I think there's a little room 

within those legal determinations for factual 

findings that are entitled to deference.  These 

prejudice determinations are so fact-intensive 

because you're -- reviewing courts are required 

to engage with the circumstances of the crime, 

with life history details, and to figure out how 

those would be weighed and -- and resolve the 

issue. 

So I think, when the district court 

makes those types of weighing determinations 

with the benefit of seeing live testimony, the 

demeanor of how people are presenting their 

opinions, all these things that trial courts are 

so well situated to do, makes them a good fact 

finder in this context, even when you're within

that I think deference is appropriate.

 And it would be helpful to -- to any 

courts conducting these type of reviews to 

understand how far that deference to their

 factual determination extends.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, to be clear, you

 would say that underlying facts like the head 

injury, for example, would be entitled to clear 

error deference by the court of appeals? 

MR. LEWIS: I think so, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And that it's only 

the prejudice weighing, the weighing of the 

mitigating and the prejudicial evidence, that 

gets de novo review in the court of appeals? 

MR. LEWIS: I think that's right 

because, you -- the -- there, the district court 

is applying the legal test that this Court gave 

in Strickland for finding prejudice, and so that 

would be naturally subject to de novo review. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And so just to 

connect it back to some of the questions Justice 

Kagan was asking you, you're saying that for the 

underlying fact like, for example, the head 

injury, a preponderance standard would apply,

 Strickland -- Stick -- Strickland standard --

sorry -- applies at the weighing only?

 MR. LEWIS: I'm not sure.  I don't

 think we've really briefed what burden would

 apply to -- to establish these facts. You know, 

in a traditional mitigating hear -- you know, in

 a penalty phase hearing in a -- in a trial 

court, in Arizona at least, capital defendants 

are required to prove their evidence by a 

preponderance of the evidence. 

But, even if it's under a reasonable 

probability standard, that is, whether there's a 

reasonable probability that a sentencer would 

find it compelling in the weighing, that's still 

a burden that they have to meet, and the 

district court or trial court's determination in 

that regard would be entitled to deference. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Lewis, I -- I 

agree with you entirely that the circuit court 

is supposed to treat the district -- should 

treat the district court's evaluation of these 

kinds of claims with great care. The district 

court is the one that sat there through all the 

evidence.  The district court presumably knows

 But, when you start talking about sort

 of clear error review of fact finding, that's

do but not the usual thing that we've asked them 

to do in this context. 

MR. LEWIS: I mean, I see the point,

-- out of a -- a third-story window.  What is 

the probability that the person is going to die?

 Is that a factual question?

 at that.

than a factual question. 

MR. LEWIS: Right, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then why do you -- why 

are you saying that whether there's a reasonable 

probability is a -- is a legal question? 

There's a legal part of the -- of the 

prejudice inquiry.  It's what is the standard. 

The standard is reasonable probability.  If the 

district court says, no, it's any minor 

probability, that's wrong.  If the district 

court says it's beyond a reasonable doubt, 

that's wrong.  But they're -- that's the legal

think, as you've suggested otherwise in response

assess whether a jury or a judge at sentencing

 would have changed its mind, you first need to

 know what the facts are --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess where I'm

 getting a little confused about all of this is 

that I thought that the standard at issue, as 

you articulated it in response to Justice Alito, 

was whether, in consideration of the total 

mitigating evidence, a reasonable -- that is --

there's a reasonable probability that the 

outcome would have been different. 

Is that right? 

MR. LEWIS: So, as Strickland terms 

it, it's a reasonable probability that the 

sentence would have been different in 

consideration of the total mitigation weighed 

against the aggravating circumstances. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Perfect.  All right. 

I agree. 

I -- I think what Justice Kagan is 

saying is that that standard takes into account 

for the purpose of its application that all of 

the mitigating evidence is being presented, that

we present this mitigating evidence, we present 

this aggravating evidence, and would, if all of

 that had happened, be out -- is there a 

reasonable probability that the outcome would be

 different.

 I think the problem that's happening

 here is that the district court, being a

 district court, is screening the mitigating

 evidence upfront. There's sort of like another 

layer being added to this on the front end where 

the district court, as you said in response to 

Justice Gorsuch, is deciding, well, is this 

really mitigating evidence?  Is this a fact? 

Did this thing happen? 

And it's sort of putting that initial 

screen on it so that when we get to the 

Strickland weighing, we have a smaller corpus of 

mitigating evidence because we've already weeded 

out the stuff that the district court -- I think 

that's not what's supposed to be happening 

actually. 

I think that whether or not this thing 

is actually a fact is determined ultimately, 

that at this level right now, the district court 

is just deciding whether or not -- that -- that

this basically has to go back to the states, 

whether the person gets habeas and it's got to 

be done over again in some sense. And in --

later is where we find out whether or not the

 thing is really true.

 But, in the context of Strickland

 prejudice, we're just saying this fact was never

 presented at all, and the question is to what 

extent was the defendant prejudiced by that 

omission.  So we're not screening upfront for 

whether or not that fact was true in any sense. 

We're sort of accepting it and -- and -- and 

saying:  Well, in any event, the defendant might 

not even be prejudiced because it was such a 

thing, right, that it doesn't outweigh the 

aggravators, so we're not going to send it back. 

So I think the problem with your 

analysis is it's got -- it has -- and the 

district court's analysis in -- in this case is 

it has the district court doing something that 

actually doesn't fit in this Strickland dynamic. 

Does that make sense?

screen the things in the manner that -- that the

 point says that they do, I think that those 

determinations are still properly made in the

 weighing.

 When you look at a case like Belmontes 

and the Court is talking about how what

 courts -- reviewing courts need to consider is

 the interaction between this evidence, how it 

changes the entire evidentiary picture, where 

the district court is saying things like Jones's 

experts are not credible for X, Y, and Z 

reasons, then, even under this view, those 

considerations become relevant in the weighing.

of his counsel. Counsel had only been a lawyer

 for three-and-a-half years and never as lead

 capital counsel.

 Despite numerous red flags about

 Jones's mental health and emotional disorders,

 counsel did not start his mitigation case or 

mitigation investigation until after Jones's 

conviction, and all he did was request an 

Arizona Rule 26.5 evaluator. 

The result was that the sentencing 

judge heard only about Jones's complicated 

birth, abuse by his first step-father up until 

age six, some head injuries, and from the Rule 

26.5 evaluator that Jones had some "possible" 

neurological abnormalities, and that was because 

the evaluator did not have the time and it would 

be beyond his charge to make actual diagnoses. 

At the federal evidentiary hearing in 

this case, of course, Mr. Jones introduced 

substantial new mitigation evidence that 

sentencing -- that the sentencing judge had 

never heard.  The new mitigating evidence showed 

that Jones was chronically abused throughout his

family members, he was plied with alcohol by a

 step-grandfather who then sexually abused him,

 and, most critically, the new mitigation 

evidence actually included diagnoses, evidence 

about the effects that all the abuse and head

 injuries had on Jones.

 These included the opinions of four

 experts who diagnosed him with, among other

 things, brain damage, PTSD, bipolar depressive 

disorder, and a learning disability. 

All this new evidence would have 

dramatically changed the sentencing calculus 

both in the trial court and before the Arizona 

Supreme Court on its independent review. 

But, instead of looking at the sum 

total of all the evidence and asking whether it 

established a reasonable probability that the 

Arizona court system might have imposed a 

different sentence, the district court serially 

nit-picked all of Jones's mitigating evidence 

and then offered its view of what it thought the 

more persuasive side was. 

That was error.  The Ninth Circuit 

properly corrected it, and this Court should 

affirm.  If this Court has questions, I welcome

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  It seems the district

 court did not say from -- at least from my 

reading that this evidence was as significant as 

you say it is. Otherwise, it would have found

 prejudice, right?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, the district court 

-- I think, in the most recent colloquy between

 Justice Jackson and Mr. Lewis, I think the 

district court did exactly what Justice Jackson 

described, which was the district court here 

went through and said: Okay, here's this 

disputed fact, I'm going to resolve it 51/49, 

60/40, whatever I -- I -- I view of it, and 

then, because Jones loses on that point, it 

doesn't get considered with respect to 

Strickland prejudice. 

And so, to -- to answer your -- I 

guess your question more directly, yes, the 

district court thought the state should win 

here, but the problem is that -- and I 

understand this.  You know, district courts 

sentence federal defendants all the time and are 

called on to make -- make findings that then are 

subject to clear error review, right, vulnerable

 This is a context where the district

weighty it is, but actually address Strickland

 So, you know, what everyone can say 

about what the district court did wrong, we're

 reviewing the circuit court opinion, and that 

opinion doesn't do what it's supposed to do.

 MR. ANDRE: So, it's -- I will 

acknowledge, Justice Kagan, that that is the --

the -- the hardest part for me, at least my

 view, of the Ninth Circuit opinion.  I mean, the 

Ninth Circuit did go through over four pages and 

compare the facts of this case to the facts of 

other cases.  But I -- I take the point, and I 

forget which one of Your Honors mentioned it, 

that the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right, but it's 

comparing, like, oh, in these other cases, the 

court had all this mitigating evidence, and, 

here, there's the same kind of mitigating 

evidence, and that means our job is done. 

But that's -- you know, what we've 

said is that the circuit court has to look at 

the good and the bad. So the circuit court is 

supposed to look at the mitigating evidence, as 

well look at the rebuttal case that the state 

put on about -- about the strength of that

mitigating evidence, and then, most crucially,

 weigh it against the aggravating evidence.

 And that -- that most crucial last

 stage -- I mean, there were lots of aggravators

 in this case, and the circuit court doesn't even

 mention some of them. 

MR. ANDRE: Well -- so I'd guess --

I'd like to push back on you, respectfully.  So

 the Ninth Circuit did three times separately 

acknowledge its obligation to do the reweighing. 

Then the Ninth Circuit twice didn't just cite 

but actually quoted the aggravating factors cite 

-- found by the trial court.  And so -- that --

that listed them, and they have, you know, 

brutal language built right into them. 

Then the court, you know, also didn't 

shy away from the -- the underlying facts of 

these murders.  It recounted them in detail in 

the beginning of the opinion and again in the 

section where it did engage in the comparison. 

Again, I -- I acknowledge this is -- I 

wish the Ninth Circuit had said more on this 

particular part of its analysis because it is 

the -- the thinnest, but I think it's still 

enough.

And what's notable also about this

 case, because, you know, you mentioned the 

additional bad evidence that may have come out, 

this is not a case like Wong v. Belmontes. In 

fact, Wong, I like that case quite a bit because

 it's a great contrast for us.  There is no new

 bad, unlike a new -- an additional murder like

 we had in Wong.  There is no new additional bad

 to be introduced in this case.  The only 

rebuttal case the state had to what we presented 

at the federal evidentiary hearing were its 

competing views of our experts. 

And as, you know, we've been 

discussing, that ultimately -- that ultimate 

credibility determination is best reserved for 

the state center.  When you have competing 

experts -- they're not Daubertable, if I can 

make up that word, they're not looney tunes and 

subject to Rule 702 -- they go to the ultimate 

fact finder if it's a toxic tort case or the 

ultimate sentencer if it's a criminal case. 

And so, again, here, there really 

isn't new bad to be weighed.  There's just what 

was always in the case that was aggravating --

and it's significant.  I -- I get that. Three

against this wealth of mitigation evidence, old 

and new, that we were able to put in between the

 various proceedings, and, on balance, this case 

looks like a lot like Williams and Porter.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. -- Mr. Andre, can

 I ask you about what seems to be your lead

 argument?  This is on page 14 of your brief in

 the summary.  "If the defendant presents 

substantial evidence of the kind that a 

reasonable sentencer might deem relevant to the 

defendant's moral culpability, even despite 

powerful aggravation evidence, relief is 

warranted."  Okay? 

So let's think of a case where the 

defendant is sort of like Hannibal Lecter, all 

right? You've got a defendant who has kidnapped 

and hideously tortured 25 children and sent 

messages to the media saying:  I love to kill 

and I'll always kill if I have the chance. 

So you've got the most horrible 

aggravating evidence that you possibly can have. 

Then you say that all that's necessary in order 

to get resentenced is for the defendant to come 

up with evidence that a reasonable sentencer

might deem relevant to the defendant's moral

 capability?  That's your argument?

 MR. ANDRE: I -- I will acknowledge in 

-- that is in the summary of argument section of 

the brief, not the argument. I think our -- our 

position is quite more nuanced. I mean, 

ultimately, what it is, is that the sum total of 

evidence, the good and the bad, is then compared 

against the guideposts that, whether you're the 

district court or you're the Ninth Circuit, the 

guideposts that those courts have, and those 

guideposts are this Court's Strickland 

precedents. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Let me ask 

you about another legal argument that you make, 

and this is on page 15.  "A district 

court...errs when its fact finding assumes the 

role of state sentencer by disregarding the 

opinions of one party's experts based on the 

superior credibility of the other" -- "other 

party's experts..." 

All right. So, I mean, let's think of 

a case where the state's expert is minimally

Alito. First, I read the Ninth Circuit's use of

 acknowledged in its opinion that a district

 court remains free to make credibility

 determinations.  Then, in the next sentence, it 

said the trial court or the district court here 

erred in determining which side's experts were

 more credible.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm not -- I'm 

not really talking here about what the Ninth 

Circuit said.  I'm talking about what you said 

in your brief. 

MR. ANDRE: Oh, I --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can the -- can the 

court make credibility determinations about 

experts, yes or no? 

MR. ANDRE: Yes.  And the district 

court here did not, and that's what I was trying 

to get at by explaining what the Ninth Circuit 

was saying.  The district court didn't say that 

these experts are trying to sneak in junk 

science, that, you know, Andre was there on the 

stand, he was sweating bullets, he wouldn't let 

anybody -- look anybody in the eyes; therefore, 

I don't believe him.

resolved this battle of the experts based on the

 transcript.  To be sure, the district court did 

sit through the hearing, but when you look at 

the district court's ruling, nowhere does the

 court layer on any of the kind of in-court

 demeanor observations that the -- Rule 52 itself

 says you have to give kind of even special

 deference to.

 So my point being the -- the district 

court is free to make these kinds of credibility 

determinations that are unique to it when it is 

receiving evidence live.  This district court 

didn't do that. 

The Ninth Circuit's point and my point 

is that in the Strickland prejudice context, it 

is error for a district court to say I think 

that the state's experts are more persuasive 

than Jones's; therefore, I'm going to not 

consider all of the evidence that came from 

Jones's experts, and, therefore, he loses on 

Strickland prejudice. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's no 

question that a fact finder gets special 

deference when the -- the credibility -- when he 

makes a credibility determination based on

 But, even if it's -- even if the --

the court says, look, I've looked at the 

credentials of this person and I've looked at

 the credentials of this other person, I've

 looked at the report, a very poor, short

 conclusory report of this one expert, these 

other reports that are much longer, much more 

detailed, much more impressive, can't say I'm 

not going to give any real weight to this one as 

opposed to the other one?  Can't do that, and 

that's subject -- that's not subject to clear 

error review? 

MR. ANDRE: In -- in -- in this 

context, no.  And -- and, actually, even in 

other contexts, I'm not sure it would be.  It 

would still get kind of careful respect, as 

Justice Kagan noticed -- noted, because we do 

care what, you know, the lower court judges 

think about issues as they percolate up.  That's 

why courts often remand even pure questions of 

law back to lower courts, to get their input on 

how should we resolve this.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- counsel, how does 

-- how does a district court do -- do the 

Strickland analysis without finding some facts? 

It has to do a reasonable probability analysis.

 You -- I think you've conceded that --

MR. ANDRE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- today.  Well, 

okay. Well, page 24 of your brief says the

 state sentencer does that, not the federal 

district court.  So I -- you know, I -- I'm a 

little flummoxed by that, I've got to confess 

too, as Justice Alito was. 

But having acknowledged that, that the 

federal district court has to make a reasonable 

probability determination, I would think that 

sometimes at least a district court could say, 

putting aside the facts of your case, that I --

I believe this expert rather than that expert, 

and that's -- that informs my reasonable 

probability analysis.  I have to determine what 

the facts are before I can decide whether a jury 

would or, in this case a sentencing judge, 

would -- there's a reasonable probability, not a 

51 percent probability, we all agree, but a 

reasonable probability that the outcome might

JUSTICE JACKSON: So can I --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Given --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- state what I 

understand you to be saying so that I can make

 sure that I understand it?

 In response to Justice Gorsuch, you 

say that the district court can make these 

credibility determinations, but the problem, I 

think, with the I believe this expert, not this 

one, upfront is that once you then take that 

mitigating expert's evidence off the table and 

then do the weighing, you might reach a 

different result than if you take all the 

evidence and then, in the context of the 

weighing, you say this mitigating evidence is 

not going to be given as much weight. 

MR. ANDRE: That's exactly right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is that what I'm 

saying?  Because I understood the -- the 

Strickland question to be that the district 

court is answering, if the sentencing judge had 

heard the evidence that the counsel deficiently

 And so he's -- he -- he's assuming 

that the uncredible expert is going to be

 presented and -- and sort of folding into his 

ultimate weighing would the outcome have been

 different if I had heard from that expert, if 

the sentencing court had heard from that expert,

 whereas, in a situation like this one, if he

 takes that expert out of the picture ahead of 

time and then makes that analysis, he could 

reach a different result? 

MR. ANDRE: Absolutely.  That's 

absolutely correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, if -- you

the Ninth Circuit had considered the aggravating 

evidence alongside the mitigating evidence, and,

didn't really do that. 

Why wouldn't a vacate and remand be 

appropriate then?

 insufficient, I think that is the -- the proper

 recourse, to send it back to the Ninth Circuit.

 I -- again -- I think, for the reasons 

I explained to Justice Kagan, the Ninth Circuit

 said enough.  It acknowledged its obligation.

 It quoted the actual aggravators.  It didn't 

just point to. It cited them. It quoted them.

 It didn't shy away from the facts.  And it -- it 

engaged in the comparative analysis that, I 

think, Strickland requires by saying, you know, 

here are all of these cases that are very 

similar with respect to how brutal the crimes 

were and with respect to what the mitigation 

was, and we think --

but positing Justice Barrett's point, wouldn't

 there be some value to everybody to have some 

finality in this case and just have us do the --

the Strickland weighing in the first instance?

 MR. ANDRE: I'm not -- I'm not

 resisting this Court doing the weighing.  It's

 just I think that the typical procedure is to 

send it back to the lower court. But, if this 

Court wants to do that, you know, you have the 

record.  You have the law. You could do that 

reweighing if you think the Ninth Circuit was --

was insufficient.  But it's a question of law, 

so I don't think the Court, without engaging in 

that reweighing, could issue a judgment. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, it just would 

be was there a reasonable probability?  And, as 

you say, we have the whole record before us and 

nothing's changed in 20 years. 

MR. ANDRE: Right.

sentence would be different given that the

 substance abuse, with the childhood, with the 

treatment, the abuse problem, and Dr. Potts's 

report had found, I think, seven mitigating

 circumstances that -- that basically were --

were similar to what the -- the trial court

 ultimately found?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, of course, the

 reasonable probability inquiry is not, you know, 

what would Judge Chavez have done had this 

evidence been before him in 1993.  It's, you 

know, a non-idiosyncratic reasonable, objective 

sentencer. 

But I -- I think whoever that person 

is in this hypothetical, there's a lot more 

evidence, and Dr. Potts was by no means a 

defense expert. 

Dr. Potts noted seven possible 

mitigators, but even the three that related to 

psychological and neuropsychological disorders, 

they are couched expressly in conditional terms. 

And I'm looking right at page JA 140: 

possibly an affective disorder, the likelihood 

of a major mental illness, an increased 

potential for neurologic sequelae.  That's --

that's in stark contrast to the seven diagnoses 

that Jones's expert said this guy actually has.

 And so I think that that changes the

 calculus right there.  And then, on top of that,

 we have --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, Dr. Potts 

reported on the likelihood that he suffers from 

a major mental illness, the head trauma he

 suffered, which increases the potential for 

neurologic problems, his intoxication at the 

time of the offense, his genetic loading for 

substance abuse, the chaotic and abusive 

childhood, was clearly before the sentencing 

judge. 

Novak was the lawyer.  The sentencing 

judge at the post-conviction review proceeding 

in 2000 said Novak is a very good attorney and 

did a good job with this difficult trial. 

That attorney, Novak, testified that 

Potts, Dr. Potts, really -- they didn't do the 

mitigation expert back at the time the way it's 

done now but that Dr. Potts performed a role 

that really was quite similar to how mitigation 

experts work in the more modern times and that 

Potts was on their team, so to speak, in trying

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, no, that's a 

fair point. The sentencing judge is the one who 

said Novak's a very good attorney who did a very 

good job in this difficult case. 

MR. ANDRE: No -- no, that -- that's 

true. But, even if we go back to Dr. Potts, Dr. 

Potts said when he gave all these conditional 

hypotheses about what Jones may be suffering 

from, said:  I would like to get more testing. 

I would like to know more. 

And then that's exactly what we 

presented at the federal evidentiary hearing. 

And then, when Dr. Potts was confronted with 

that, he said:  Yeah, that's exactly what we 

needed back then. 

And so not only do you have, again, 

actual diagnoses now that are finally coming in 

in 2006 that the sentencer didn't hear in 1993,

head injuries and you have a dramatically more 

significant history and pattern of abuse.

 I mean, it's one thing for Jones to 

have been, you know, treated very, very poorly 

up until age six. It's another thing for Jones

 sexually, all the way up to age 17.

are the defendants getting from -- from zero to

 60. And I just want to be clear that it doesn't 

matter whether one defendant started, let's say,

 at 10 and then got to 60 miles an hour all at

 the evidentiary hearing stage in federal court 

or with Jones, where there was more mitigation

 than in Porter, Rompilla, Wiggins, and Williams. 

And so Jones might be starting out at 15 or 20

 miles an hour.  But they have to get to 60 in 

order to establish the reasonable probability 

for relief. 

And so the way that you would engage 

in this weighing is I think you would look at 

the four lead cases this Court has decided --

Anders v. Texas is also relevant in this space 

based on how the Court characterized the 

evidence there -- and then say:  Okay, that --

that sets the -- the floor.  That's the 

60-mile-an-hour speed test. 

Did Jones, with all of his mitigation

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And I guess I

 would think it different if the -- if the 

sentencing judge had no awareness of the

 childhood abuse, no awareness of the head

 injuries, no awareness of the substance abuse,

 but the -- was -- the sentencing judge was aware 

of all that, those basics --

MR. ANDRE: But --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- but still said 

these crimes are too much, you know, and we 

don't need to go through them, but they're --

you know, the sentencing judge was too much. 

MR. ANDRE: The -- that's why I used 

the zero-to-60 reference, Justice Kavanaugh.  It 

doesn't matter where Jones started vis-à-vis the 

other defendants in these cases because Jones 

did start out a little bit ahead of them because 

there was more mitigation at the aggravation and 

mitigation sentencing hearing before Judge 

Chavez than there were in Porter, Rompilla, 

Williams, and Wiggins. 

But my point is that I think Jones 

clearly got to 60 miles an hour, and he had an 

easier time getting there because he did have

more to start with.

 But the question just is did they get

 there and then, you know, how bad is the

 aggravation.  Again, brutal crimes here.  We

 acknowledge that, but there's a lot of 

mitigation, and when you match it up against

 those -- the four cases from this Court, it's

 really hard to see any difference. There's, you

 know, longstanding childhood trauma, a lot of 

head injuries, and diagnoses by doctors who were 

not precluded from testifying because they were 

sneaking in junk -- junk science and not because 

they were looney tunes under 702.  That all goes 

to the state sentencer to weigh. And -- and 

because we're not there yet, we're in the 

federal system, we're asking, is there a 

reasonable probability that all of that evidence 

might have persuaded that state sentencer to 

favor life? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --

you know, just to continue with your analogy, I 

think the question is he didn't have to get to 

60, right?  He needed to get to 120 given the 

aggravating circumstances that were before the 

-- before the jury.

MR. ANDRE: That -- if that's --

that's what this Court feels, that's what this 

-- this Court feels. And I guess this -- this 

underscores why the analysis of the -- the 

weight and persuasiveness to be given each piece 

of evidence is best dealt with on the back end

 under the prejudice prong, right?

 So the district court, again, is going 

to take all this evidence and it's going to 

express its views.  The Ninth Circuit's going to 

look at that.  It's not going to have to defer 

to those views, but it's going to do its own 

weighing and it's going to come to this Court 

and this Court's going to opine. And if this 

Court, you know, wants to say, in Porter, 

Rompilla, Wiggins, Williams -- actually, 

Williams and Porter are the strongest for my 

side -- yeah, those defendants only had to get 

to 60, here Jones had to get to 120, that's for 

this Court to do but for this Court to do 

without deference to the district court's gloss 

on the evidence from 13, 14 years ago.

 deficient.

 And I guess one thing I do want to

 underscore really quickly is that, you know, our 

rule would cut both ways. If there was a

 district judge in Judge Bolton's situation who

 made -- and I counted 13 -- she never used the

 word "preponderance," to your point earlier, 

Justice Alito, but a lot of synonyms for

 "preponderance."  If you had a district judge 

who made 13 findings favorable to the defense 

and the state were to appeal, our rule would 

help the state out there and say no, you know, 

the district court can do certain things 

factually, but generally speaking, when the 

court is evaluating which side's evidence is 

more persuasive, is there a diagnosis or not, 

that all gets dealt with on the back end under 

Strickland prejudice, and that at least is 

subject to de novo review on appeal.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JASON D. LEWIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LEWIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief

 Justice.

           Even putting aside the particular

 questions about the scope and where the line is

 drawn and the factual question, on Strickland 

reweighing alone, this Court's action is 

compelled.  The seven aggravating circumstances 

found here are among the most weighty 

aggravating circumstances under Arizona law. 

And, you know, this was footnoted in 

the brief, and I wanted to scream it in the 

brief. The -- the district -- or the -- the 

circuit court barely mentioned the -- the fourth 

aggravating circumstance as to Tisha Weaver, the 

seven-year-old girl who Jones brutally murdered. 

That bare mention tells me and tells any reader 

that it did not factor into their determination. 

When you look at those aggravating 

circumstances and you understand how Arizona 

courts treat those aggravating circumstances, 

this is, as we argue in our brief, almost a 

foregone conclusion that there is no reasonable

probability that this sentence would have been

 different. 

And I would submit, even if you take

 every single scrap of Jones's evidence submitted 

at district court as true, the brutality

 inflicted upon the victims here -- and let's

 include Katherine Gumina, the grandmother who 

died but died too late because she was in a coma 

for months until she died right before trial 

started -- this is far different from those core 

cases that my friend relies on.  There are more 

victims.  The aggravation is more severe.  And 

the difference in mitigation is less because, as 

you all have recognized, Jones had a pretty good 

mitigation case before the trial court. 

The trial court found that he suffered 

from long-term substance abuse, that genetic 

factors and head injuries contributed to that 

substance abuse, that he was under the influence 

of drugs and alcohol at the time of the crimes, 

which is especially compelling in Arizona as far 

as mitigation evidence goes because it actually
