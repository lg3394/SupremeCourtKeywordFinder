 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 Relentless versus the Department of Commerce.

 Mr. Martinez.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MARTINEZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

For too long, Chevron has distorted 

the judicial process and undermined statutory 

interpretation.  It should be overruled for 

three reasons. 

First, Chevron violates the 

Constitution.  Article III empowers judges to 

say what the law is. It requires them to 

interpret federal statutes using their best and 

independent judgment. 

Chevron undermines that duty. It 

reallocates interpretive authority from courts 

to agencies, and it forces courts to adopt 

inferior agency constructions that are issued 

for political or policy reasons. In doing so, 

Chevron blocks judges from serving as faithful

agents of Congress.  It mandates judicial bias

 and encourages agency overreach. And by 

removing key checks on executive power, it

 threatens individual liberty.

           Chevron also violates the APA. The 

most straightforward reading of Section 706 

requires de novo review of legal questions. 

Congress put constitutional and statutory 

interpretation on equal footing, and it required 

independent legal judgment as to both. As 

Justice Scalia wrote, the APA's text 

"contemplates that courts, not agencies, will 

authoritatively resolve ambiguities in 

statutes." 

And, third, this Court's only 

justification for Chevron is the implied 

delegation theory, but that theory is a fiction. 

There's no reason to think that Congress intends 

every ambiguity in every agency statute to give 

agencies an ongoing power to interpret and 

reinterpret federal law in ways that override 

its best meaning. 

In this case, the agency 

misinterpreted the MSA to force struggling 

fishermen to pay up to 20 percent of their

annual profits to federal agents.  The

 government says that even if all nine of you

 agree with us that the agency's construction is 

worse than ours, you should nonetheless defer to

 that construction and uphold their program under 

Chevron. That's not consistent with the rule of

 law. If we have the best view of the statute,

 we should win this case.

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Martinez, how 

much deference is in tension with the judicial 

role? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think it's very much 

in tension, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  No.  How much would 

it require?  I mean, your argument is that 

Chevron deference is problematic.  But how do we 

determine how much deference is too much 

deference? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think you've 

certainly crossed the line when you have a rule 

that says that we're going to allocate 

interpretive authority from -- from Article III 

courts to an agency.  And so, when -- when 

you've got deference that amounts to that, which

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think what I'm

 trying -- what I'm asking is, how do we know

 where the line is?  We show deference.  You --

 there's Skidmore deference.

 MR. MARTINEZ:  Sure.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  We are deferential in 

fact finding, et cetera.  So I'm just trying to 

determine whether you're saying that we -- if 

it's not de novo review --

MR. MARTINEZ:  Right. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- without any 

presumptions or deference, then it's 

problematic. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think deference 

becomes problematic when it requires a judge to 

say that the law means X when, really, the judge 

thinks the law means Y.  I think Skidmore 

deference is not problematic because it doesn't 

require that.  Skidmore deference essentially 

says -- and -- and we would be very comfortable 

with Skidmore -- that because the agency has a

often the agency has helped draft the statute, 

the agency has knowledge of the policy context 

surrounding the statute and its implementation.

 Of course, courts should pay special 

attention to what agencies say, but the agency 

ultimately has to bring its expertise to bear in

 a way that's persuasive. And if the -- court 

isn't persuasive, if the court thinks that the 

law means X even though the agency thinks the 

law means Y, then the court needs to go with the 

best interpretation of the statute, just like it 

does in every other --

 reasonable.  That's a term that courts apply in

 many situations.

the best meaning of the statute there would be

to choose among certain policy options. 

Now that doesn't mean that the agency 

can just do whatever it wants because there are 

limits, and the court has to police that limits. 

Michigan versus EPA is a good example.  Congress 

used a broad term like "appropriate" and the 

question was -- and -- which is similar to 

"reasonable," in giving the agency a -- a range 

of discretion.  But, at the same time, when the 

agency said, well, we don't have to consider 

costs in figuring out whether something is 

appropriate, the court said no, that -- that, as 

a legal matter, the best interpretation of the 

word "appropriate" in the context of this

commerce means, I think that would be a classic 

legal question that would be a legal question

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you could

 imagine -- you could imagine situations where 

the interstate commerce determination is

 peculiarly fact-bound, you know, trucks

 transferring loads and -- at transfer points on

 the border.  Is that in interstate commerce for 

each one or not? And isn't the policy judgment 

of the agency pertinent in that situation? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think, certainly, the 

policy judgment of the agency is -- is pertinent 

in determining sort of the facts because the 

agency might be on the ground and understand the 

factual scenario. 

But I think there's a -- an important 

legal component to that question, that in any 

other context, like, for example, if you were 

interpreting the Constitution, I think the court 

would -- would quite reasonably think it's its 

own job to interpret the constitutional 

requirement of interstate commerce and would --

would say -- would give its best meaning. And I

MR. MARTINEZ:  So, Your Honor, I think 

a couple things. 

First of all, I don't think Chevron is 

a doctrine that only applies to tie-breaker 

50/50 scenarios.  It's never been understood 

that way.  You know, Justice Scalia in his 

famous article in 1989 --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not a 

tie-breaker. There are just some times where 

you look at a statute and the most honest 

reading is that there's -- there's -- there's a 

gap there --

MR. MARTINEZ:  But --

limits of language, because of the limits of our

 the first place.  What would a court do?  Would 

a court look at the statute -- a statutory term

 hard, it's sort of 52/48, it's kind of close.  I

fairest one because it's going to be one you

 source in the Clean Air Act -- does it refer to

But -- but can I just go back and I 

think what you described earlier about listening 

to the agency and taking into account all those 

things, our -- our rule would allow that. 

That's Skidmore. 

I think the only difference between

Skidmore sort of approach and the Chevron 

approach is that after listening to the agency's 

explanation of all the things that you said, if

 the court isn't persuaded by the agency that the 

agency's interpretation is correct, Chevron 

would say you still have to go with the agency. 

And that's just like a dramatic thing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why not?

 Meaning I -- I think all of the play and

 disagreement is around the word "ambiguity."  I

 know that there have been some earlier cases

 that suggested, if there were two plausible 

meanings, you went with the agency meaning. 

I think we've gone far beyond that. 

It has to be two reasonable meanings.  Assuming 

-- you -- you make an assumption that there is a 

best answer.  I don't know how you can say 

there's a best answer when Justices of this 

Court routinely disagree and we routinely 

disagree at 5-4. 

Is the best answer simply a majority 

answer?  I don't think so. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  But -- but, Your Honor, 

if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I happen, when I 

dissent, to think the others got it wrong. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they often do.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But putting that

 aside -- but putting that aside, in those

 situations, there are two plausible -- not

 nearly plausible.  There are two best answers, 

and the question is who makes the choice or

 helps you make the choice.

 And if the Court can -- can disagree 

reasonably and comes to that tie-breaker point, 

and it could be 51/49, it -- it could be 52/53, 

if it's that close, why shouldn't the person 

with all of the qualities you spoke about, the 

entity with all of the qualities, expertise, 

experience, on-the-ground execution, knowledge 

of consequences, why shouldn't deference be 

given to that entity? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Justice Sotomayor, I 

think your explanation of ambiguity just now 

just proves the problem with Chevron because I 

think what you said is that whenever there's a 

case, a statutory case in which the members of 

the Court disagree with one another, that that's 

essentially saying the statute's ambiguous 

because reasonable people can disagree.

MR. MARTINEZ:  Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- about Chevron, Mr.

 Martinez.  As we've described it is you -- you 

work hard to figure out a statutory problem.

 You don't say, oh, it's difficult.  Oh, there 

are two interpretations. Oh, you know, not

 flat. 

You don't say that.  You do everything 

you do, look at the text, look at legislative 

history if you believe in legislative history, 

look at context, look at every tool you can, and 

still there are places where we don't know 

whether this drug is a -- is a -- is a --

whether this product is a drug or a dietary 

supplement, and it's best to defer to people who 

do know, who have had long experience on the 

ground, who have seen a thousand of these kinds 

of situations.

they don't know.

 Sotomayor to be saying that whenever judge --

Justices of this Court disagree about the best 

meaning of the statute, because, obviously, 

everyone on the Court is reasonable, that shows

 that there's an ambiguity.

 If that's the test, which I think was

 the implication of the question, then that can't

 be wrong.  That's much broader than --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That wasn't --

MR. MARTINEZ:  -- step one. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- my implication. 

My implication was that using all the statutory 

tools, you can still come up, using them in good 

faith, using them, you can still come up with no 

answer --

 to figure out what the law is. You should be 

able to rely on the best interpretation of the

somehow changed even though Congress hasn't

 acted.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And that's the delta

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think -- I think 

that's right.  I mean, Skidmore, I think, would 

allow for -- for courts to give meaningful 

weight and consideration to -- to persuasive 

opinions by agencies.  The only thing Skidmore 

doesn't do is require a court to give up its --

its interpretive -- ultimate interpretive say 

and defer to an interpretation that is not 

persuasive. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Martinez, what 

-- what I'm stuck on is what seems to be an 

assumption in your argument that every question 

posed with respect to interpreting --

interpreting a statute is a legal one.

 important work of helping courts stay away from

 policymaking, and so I -- I'd like for you to 

sort of think of it through that lens and help

 me understand why, if we do away with Chevron's 

framework, we won't have a problem of courts

 actually making a policy decision.

 So Justice Kagan gave you a number of

 examples, and I think the reason why those 

examples are hard or why they're ambiguous or 

whatever is because, at bottom, they're not 

asking legal questions; they're asking policy 

questions.  How is it that, you know, 

"stationary source" is to be defined?  That's 

not really a legal question.  I mean, there 

could be several reasonable ways of interpreting 

that. And at the end of the day, I think the 

way I've been thinking about Chevron is Congress 

has given that policy choice to the agency. 

And my concern is that if we take away 

something like Chevron, the court will then 

suddenly become a policymaker, by majority rule 

or not, making policy determinations.  So how 

can we avoid that? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  So we agree, obviously, 

that -- that courts should not be in the

 business of policymaking.  And I think the whole

 enterprise of statutory interpretation, when

 properly understood, is -- is designed to take 

courts out of policymaking because what -- what

 the court is trying to do is -- is act as a 

faithful agent of what Congress has done and

 find the best --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But isn't that --

MR. MARTINEZ:  -- interpretation. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- isn't that what 

Chevron does?  I mean, isn't Chevron, step one, 

even in this very case, asking the question, 

one, has Congress made that policy 

determination?  So, for example, here, the 

question is whether or not monitors on the boats 

have to be paid for by the owner of the boat. 

I see that as a policy question. 

Congress could have said yes or no.  There's 

nothing about law really inherently in the 

question of should the monitors on the boats be 

paid for by the owners or the government.  So 

step one is has Congress in the statute answered 

that question. 

When we say no, everybody agrees 

that's not in the statute, then we say the

 they do so in a reasonable way.  And the -- and

 the courts sort of police the boundaries of 

reasonableness. But whether or not the monitors

 are paid for is not really a legal question.

 MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think the 

question of whether or not the law allows the

 agency to -- to force the monitors to be paid

 for by private industry is absolutely a legal 

question.  I -- I agree with you that when 

Congress --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But isn't that the 

same question as to whether or not -- isn't that 

just another way of saying, can this policy 

determination be made by the agency? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  No, I -- I don't think 

so. I think the difference is, when the -- when 

the -- when the policymaker, whether it's 

Congress or the agency, is sitting there and 

trying to figure out, like, what the best policy 

is, would the world be a better place if 

industry has to pay for these monitors or not, 

that's absolutely a policy question.

see why we aren't overriding the -- the agency's 

policy prerogative. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  But the -- the -- the 

question that the court should be answering is 

not should agency -- should industry pay for the 

monitors.  The question that the court should be 

answering is, did Congress require or allow 

agent -- industry to be forced to pay for the 

monitors?  And that's a very different question.

That's the difference between law and

 policymaking.

 And I think the whole assumption and

 the whole understanding of statutory 

interpretation under this Court's cases is

 there's a difference between law and

 policymaking.  Judges are there not to exercise

 force or will.  They're there to exercise

 judgment.  They're -- they're serving as neutral 

umpires.  They're not players on the field. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So how 

does that --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Martinez --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- play out under 

your interpretation -- so, here, what -- what is 

the question we're supposed to be answering? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  The question you're 

supposed to be answering is, did -- does this 

statute require -- has Congress required --

either required the -- the monitors to be paid 

for by industry, or has it given the agency the 

authority to make that decision? And I don't 

think -- I think that is a legal -- both of 

those versions of that question are legal 

questions, and the answer is no.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Martinez, can I

 ask you a question about this line between law 

and policy? And I want to ask you in the 

context of one of Justice Kagan's examples, the

 dietary supplement or drug. 

Where is the line between something 

that would be then subject to arbitrary and

 capricious review and something that's a 

question of law? Because I'm just wondering 

whether we could say that the definition of 

dietary supplement or drug might be something 

that's a question of statutory interpretation in 

the context of the statute, but which category 

any one thing fell in might be a question of 

policy for the agency. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Right.  I --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Is that possible? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  -- I -- I think that's 

right. I think that would be more of a -- of a, 

you know, application of law to fact or a 

factual question.  But I think the core question 

of, like, you know, what is the meaning of 

dietary supplement, and I forget what the other 

alternative was, those are legal questions.

is. And, you know, courts all of the time make 

judgments about whether things are reasonable. 

But I -- I don't understand you to be 

disagreeing that things like whether 

something -- that an agency could be tasked with 

deciding what was the most feasible, most 

useful, most reasonable.

Well, courts could do that too.  So is

 that a delegation of judicial power that would 

offend Article III in your view, to give those

 kinds of --

MR. MARTINEZ:  No, I think --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- decisions to an

 agency?

 MR. MARTINEZ:  -- I think the way to

 think about those kinds of -- of statutory 

provisions would be that the best interpretation 

of the statute, given the nature of the word 

"reasonable" in context, is to confer a range of 

discretion on the agency. 

And so I think a court in that case --

if -- if the agency is operating within the 

range of discretion, that's arbitrary and 

capricious review.  If the agency is sort of 

operating at the edges, you have to figure out 

where the guardrails are.  That's the legal 

question. 

So, if the -- if the statute says, you 

know, the agency can pick red, blue, or green, 

then the choice among those three options is for 

the agency.  But, if you have a legal question 

like, oh, does pink count as red, that's a legal

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

 Martinez.

 How much of an actual question on the

 ground is this?  I saw some study that said we

 haven't relied on Chevron for 14 years.  And

 Judge Kethledge has written -- he's been a judge

 for 10 years.  He's never invoked Chevron step

 two. 

You know, judges are used to deciding 

things, and when they get around to doing it, 

they tend to think what they've come up with is 

not only the best answer, but it's the only 

answer. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and I 

just wonder how often this comes up? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think it comes up a 

lot, Your Honor.  And this Court hasn't relied 

on Chevron since 2016, but the lower courts 

still have to apply it.  And I think these two 

cases, the -- the two that you're going to hear 

this morning, sort of show what happens when --

when courts are applying this doctrine because 

they're -- they're essentially getting to a

instead of asking what -- what does the statute

judges were allowing their policy views, 

consciously or unconsciously, to -- to -- to 

influence their interpretation of the statutes 

in question?

over time, regardless of what it was then, in 

large part due to the very salutary developments 

in the way that this Court and the lower courts

 generally now think about statutory

 construction.

 In the old days, there was a lot of 

reliance on legislative history and on sort of

 more free-form analysis that I think made it

 easier for policy considerations to infect the 

judicial decision-making process.  But this 

Court has now made clear that, you know, really, 

we should be text-focused, we should be focused 

on faithful agency to Congress.  So I think that 

is one difference. 

I think another difference is courts 

now have become more appreciative of the fact 

that we're not just talking about, you know, 

judicial -- rules of, like, judicially made 

common law about how to interpret statutes.  We 

have the APA here. 

Justice Scalia was a big defender of 

Chevron in its original incarnation but, over 

time, came to realize that the APA had text that 

actually bore on this question.

that text, you come to the same place as our 

Article III argument, which is that courts have 

to exercise independent judgment.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the

 canons of interpretation that we have now and 

all of the other tools that we have in our

 statutory interpretation toolkit are like the 

Enigma machine and so we have these statutes and 

they're sort of written in code and we run them 

through the Enigma machine and, abracadabra, we 

have the best interpretation?  Do you really 

think that's how it works? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think that what 

this Court does with respect to the normal 

canons of construction is it's used the -- it's 

-- it's generated those canons as rough rules of 

thumb to help guide the interpretive process 

because, if the Court believes that the canons 

best approximate the best original meaning of 

the statute, especially -- and then there's some 

canons that -- that sort of are not purely 

textual canons but that sort of are informed by 

constitutional -- foundational constitutional 

values.

 something -- you're not trying to find the best

 interpretation anymore.  You're, in fact,

 agreeing that you have to impose the not-best 

interpretation because you have to defer.

 And so, unlike all the other canons, 

Chevron is the only one that says to courts, you 

can stop doing your normal interpretive function

 and we're going to allocate that interpretive 

function outside of Article III.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Until the agency 

does something else? And then people can come 

back because it's not stare decisis anymore?

 MR. MARTINEZ:  So I think, with 

respect to the effects of -- of applying normal

 rules of construction here instead of Chevron, 

I'd say two things.

 First of all, the 70 holdings or

 whatever, the bottom-line holdings in those 

cases would get stare decisis, so they would not 

be undermined. So there's no convulsive change 

of the law with respect to that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't understand 

how that happens.  Once you have a new approach, 

I'm not sure. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But let me move on 

to the second part of my question, which is the 

cases that come to the Court are usually the 

hard cases.  So you say, in the last 14 years, 

we've barely referenced Chevron. 

And do you know what the breakup is? 

How often have we been -- consistently upheld

essentially says, like, the statute is clear.

 But I think what those 9-0 decisions 

show is how confusing and unworkable Chevron is 

because the lower courts, you know, purported to 

do or didn't really do what they were supposed 

to do and they came to the opposite conclusion, 

not necessarily because they thought that --

that your interpretation wasn't the best but 

rather because it thought that the statute was 

ambiguous enough that it required deference. 

And so this, like, threshold --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, that 

judgment is inherent in every question.  I mean, 

that -- that kind of problem is just a part not 

just of judging but of decision-making, period, 

of life.  And so it's not clear to me that the 

fact that there may be some ambiguity about 

what -- how much ambiguity, the question that 

Justice Thomas asked, it doesn't take away from 

the basic premise of Chevron, which is a 

reasonable interpretation within the bounds 

of -- of common statutory interpretation should 

be given deference. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Right.  But I -- I do

 think the ambiguity trigger introduces a whole 

kind of threshold question that's very hard to

 apply neutrally.  I mean, you have great judges.

 Judge Kethledge, I think, was referenced.  He

 doesn't -- he never found a case that required 

him to go past step one.

 Judge Silberman, another great judge, 

said that in most cases he thought the statute 

was ambiguous. And if there's that much 

disagreement, then I think that's a sign that 

Chevron really isn't workable. 

And this Court has tried to rein in 

Chevron in numerous ways, but I think that what 

all of those efforts show is that you -- you 

kind of need a secret decoder ring to figure out 

what the law means under this Court's approach. 

You have to do step zero.  You have to 

apply Mead.  Then you have to do a robust step 

one inquiry taking into account Footnote 9 and 

taking into account, you know, how much 

ambiguity is needed. 

In this -- in the D.C. Circuit, you 

have to do step one and a half, where you have 

to figure out whether the agency recognized that 

the statute was ambiguous.

Under Kisor, there's maybe a step

 three that says you turn off deference when the 

agency's operating outside of its area of

 expertise.  And then overlying all of that 

you've got the Major Questions Doctrine.

 And so I think, if -- if -- if that's

 kind of what --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's the

 Court's creation. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Right.  But it's the 

Court's creation because it's trying to solve 

the fundamental problem, which is that Chevron 

is doing something very weird.  It's taking 

interpretive authority that belongs to courts 

and it's giving it to agencies. 

So all of these bells and whistles are 

efforts to kind of claw it back to address the 

symptoms, but I think it's time for the Court to 

address the disease, the underlying problem, 

which is Chevron itself.

big piece of legislation on the horizon and who 

knows, don't have a crystal ball, but I'm going

 to say -- I'm going to guess that it's

 artificial intelligence.

 So let's imagine Congress enacts an

 artificial intelligence bill and it has all

 kinds of delegations, maybe it creates an agency 

for the purpose or maybe it uses existing

 agencies and it has all kinds of delegations to 

that agency or agencies about how to regulate 

artificial intelligence so that this nation can 

capture the -- the -- the opportunities but also 

meet the challenges of that. 

And then, just by the nature of things 

and especially the nature of the subject, there 

are going to be all kinds of places where, 

although there's not an explicit delegation, 

Congress has, in effect, left a gap.  It has 

created an ambiguity.  And what Congress is 

thinking is, do we want courts to fill that gap, 

or do we want an agency to fill that gap? 

When the normal techniques of legal 

interpretation have run out, on the matter of 

artificial intelligence, what does Congress 

want, Mr. Martinez?

The congressional intent, it -- you know, the --

the delegation is not explicit on the face of

Congress knows things about different 

institutions, about what they know, about what 

they're competent with respect to, and Congress 

knows that this Court and lower courts are not 

competent with respect to deciding all the 

questions about AI that are going to come up in 

the future.

people who know about AI are people who, to some 

degree in some way, are accountable to the

 political process.  They have constituencies.

 They have fact-finding abilities.  They are

 obligated to go consult with people.  They

 report to a president, who needs to be elected.

 In all kinds of ways, both with --

with respect to expertise and with respect to 

their connections to the public and to other

courts be able to decide these issues as to 

things they know nothing about, courts that are

is about.

 MR. MARTINEZ:  -- I think the

 constitutional answer is that Congress needs to

 set the rules with respect to AI.  It can

 delegate some policymaking discretion to 

agencies. But, once the law is written and the

 interpretive function has begun, then that job

 is -- is for the courts.

 And I think this case actually really 

is a good example because I think the problem 

with Chevron is that, like, no one really -- I 

mean, I'm curious to see what the Solicitor 

General will say about this, but does anyone 

really think that Congress was presuming that 

the agency would get to decide the question of 

who pays for the monitors? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  I have one last 

question.  Do you think that Congress could 

codify -- codify Chevron? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I don't think so 

because I think that -- that a statute that 

codifies Chevron would say, essentially, that 

the interpretive authority has been reallocated 

from the court to the agency.  I think that --

MR. MARTINEZ:  -- interpretive

 authority --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- cannot decide that

 in cases -- after all the statutory tools have

 been used and there remains a gap or an

 ambiguity, Congress could not decide that it

 wants people who know something about something

 to decide the questions that will be left over.

 MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think that gives 

away and -- and would -- would take away from 

courts and give to agencies core judicial 

interpretive authority.  I don't think Congress 

could do that.  In the same way that Congress 

couldn't tell the president how to exercise the 

veto power or the pardon power, it can't tell 

courts how to do interpretation and to defer to 

someone else.

 have to?

 MR. MARTINEZ:  I think you could 

resolve this case under the APA, and we would

 certainly welcome an -- an interpretation of the 

APA that comes out our way, especially if it's 

informed by constitutional avoidance principles 

that I think have a lot of salience here.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Are -- does anything 

in your argument suggest or depend upon the idea 

that judges should make or decide policy 

questions about AI or anything else? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Of -- no.  We -- we a 

hundred percent agree that judges should not do 

policy.  We just think that they should do law. 

And that's in -- Chevron is about legal 

questions. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Then there was some 

question about past decisions, and as you 

pointed out, this Court's moved away from using 

legislative history to some degree in favor of 

text, and we've made other changes in our 

interpretive approaches too without Congress's 

intervention, for example, in sovereign immunity 

contexts, returning to the clear statement rule

that had preexisted this Court's jurisprudence 

for 200 years, and then we wandered off into 

legislative history and circled back around and

 corrected our own mistake.

 We had to deal with the question of 

what to do with those precedents, and our answer 

was to leave them alone from -- from those 

ancient regimes, as we --

           MR. MARTINEZ:  Right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- called them.  Are 

you asking us to -- to do anything different

MR. MARTINEZ:  No, and if I could just 

explain what -- how I think the world would look 

with respect to the old cases.  I think stare 

decisis would apply to the holdings of those old 

cases. I don't think that -- that anything 

would change.  You know, "stationary source" 

would still mean what it meant when -- when the 

Court issued that bottom-line interpretation. 

And -- and so I don't think that this would -- a 

ruling in favor of our side would -- would 

require or entail overturning any of those old 

cases.

 Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Several questions. 

First of all, on Skidmore, there was reference 

to Skidmore deference, and I guess I don't think 

that's the right term, that it's respect or pay 

attention to, but I think, if we throw the term 

"deference" into Skidmore deference, we're going 

to walk into another problem --

MR. MARTINEZ:  Some --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- like the one we 

have with Chevron deference. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Some -- some might say 

"deference" is ambiguous.  I think that --

(Laughter.) 

MR. MARTINEZ:  -- that it's imprecise. 

I think the better way -- I think oftentimes, 

when people say "deference," what they mean is 

that if you think the answer is X, you should

defer to someone else's answer, which is

 different.  I don't think -- I think absolutely

 that that would be inappropriate.  So I would 

not use "Skidmore deference" because I think it 

-- it runs the risk of -- of giving that

 implication.

 I think that, really, we're talking

 about very serious consideration of the points 

that the agency makes, but, ultimately, you have 

to be persuaded.  And if you're persuaded, then 

that means that you've concluded that the agency 

has the best interpretation and then you just 

apply the normal rules. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  I thought 

Skidmore was about the power to persuade, not 

the power to control. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Exactly. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  We -- I agree with 

that. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  On the

 constitutional issue.

 So I guess why -- why would we reach

 it? If -- if we agreed with you on overruling 

Chevron on other grounds, I don't see the need 

to address the hypothetical that Justice Kagan

 raised --

MR. MARTINEZ:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- about Congress

 passing a Chevron-type regime. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think three things on 

that. Like I said earlier, we would certainly 

welcome overruling Chevron, especially under the 

APA and especially if informed by constitutional 

avoidance principles. 

But I think there are three reasons 

why you should consider going beyond that to the 

constitutional holding.  There are going to be 

some cases that, as a technical matter, 

Section 706 of the APA wouldn't -- doesn't 

apply. And so, if it's an APA holding, it may 

be that in those cases there might be lingering 

uncertainty about whether deference should --

should apply to cases that aren't technically 

under Section 706. 

I think the second thing is that a lot

of the analysis in figuring out what the duty 

under the APA to interpret the law, I think a 

lot of that analysis really overlaps with the 

constitutional points. And I think, if you --

if you get to a place where you agree with us on 

the APA, it's not that far, not that different 

to ultimately agree with us on the Constitution

 as well.

 And then, finally, I would just say 

that although, of course, this Court often 

prefers to rule on non-constitutional grounds, I 

think it's also recognized in cases like Pearson 

versus Callahan that there's going to be a value 

and a benefit to the judicial system to 

providing clarity about what the Constitution 

means. I think -- I would respectfully submit 

this is one of those situations. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the question of 

how much does Chevron matter on the ground, I 

think you addressed this a little bit by citing 

Judge Silberman, but do you want to elaborate on 

that? I mean, are -- there are cases, I assume, 

that get to Chevron step two pretty regularly.

think, if a case like this one or two cases like

 these two can get to Chevron step two, I think 

that suggests that it's really hard to figure 

out how Chevron step one is supposed to work.

 I mean, the Digital Realty case is

 another great example.  That's a case where

 there was a statutory definition of the term

 "whistleblower" that required the person to have

 gone to the SEC and -- and, you know, submitted 

a -- a complaint, and the government and the 

lower court concluded that that was ambiguous 

and that it might actually apply, it was 

reasonable to read the statute to not require a 

report to the SEC. 

So I think there are cases, there are 

examples like these that come up all the time, 

and, you know, thankfully, this Court doesn't 

have to intervene every single time, but the 

reason that the problem is there is because 

you've told lower courts how to do their 

interpretation.  And as long as that instruction 

is out there, there are going to be a lot of 

cases that get it wrong, and you're not going to 

want to be in the business of sort of error 

correction on each one.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the question of 

how Congress can operate without Chevron, I just 

want to elaborate on -- have you elaborate on

 that a little more.

 My understanding is Congress

 oftentimes will use terms like "the agency can 

regulate reasonable limits" or "appropriate 

limits," and that gives, under State Farm, a lot 

of discretion to the agency to make choices to 

do what Justice Kagan was talking about, to 

think about the world as it exists five years 

from now or 10 years from now and not have to 

worry about going back to Congress. 

So the question really is for Congress 

and its drafting choices, I think, what kinds of 

broad, capacious terms it uses, as opposed to 

using more defined terms or statutory terms --

usual kinds of statutory language.  Yes, it 

can't rewrite that.  At least that's how I 

thought Congress could operate in a world where 

Chevron does not exist. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think that's 

exactly right, Justice Kavanaugh.  And I think 

that, like I said earlier, in -- in those 

situations, the Court's job is basically

figuring out what the best interpretation of

 that word is.  And in -- in many cases, maybe 

most cases, those types of capacious words are

 basically -- the best understanding of those

 words is that Congress is, in fact, conferring

 the discretion on the agency.

 That's very different from Chevron, 

where, instead of having any sort of language

 like that or express language conferring a 

delegation, you're -- you're basically applying 

this fictional implied delegation that -- that 

is triggered by ambiguity, which is like -- you 

know, it -- frankly, it's -- it's -- it's not --

it's fictional, it's made up. 

And so I think a world in which 

Congress, when it wants to delegate to agencies, 

needs to be express and use language like that 

or other language, I think is a better world 

from the perspective of -- of Article I and from 

Article III.

 So you said that overruling Chevron 

wouldn't have an effect on the many cases that 

have gotten to Chevron step two and then

 deferred to the agency.  You said -- am I -- did 

I understand you correctly? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Those bottom-line 

holdings would be right, yeah, would be.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  But the 

bottom-line holdings in those cases, if the 

Court did defer at step two, are simply that the 

agency's interpretation was reasonable.  And 

maybe sometimes, like in Brand X, they might 

even be like, well, we would reach a different 

interpretation if it were our call -- our call, 

but it's ambiguous, so the agency can decide. 

So maybe nothing happens immediately 

to those cases, but isn't the door then open for 

litigants to come back and say:  Well, 

"stationary source" really means X or, you know, 

"broadband" or whatever the specific term was in 

-- in Brand X? 

So isn't it inviting a flood of 

litigation even if for the moment those holdings 

stay intact?

MR. MARTINEZ:  So I would say the

 bottom-line holdings in those cases, I would

 just quibble slightly --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure.

 MR. MARTINEZ:  -- I would -- I would

 describe the bottom-line holding as being that 

the agency's action was lawful. And so that's

 the bottom line.

 I think it's true that people could 

come and say, look, the interpretive methods 

have changed since this bottom-line holding was 

issued and we think that -- that, you know, a 

different result now should apply.  And -- and 

that's why courts consider requests to overturn 

precedent.  But I just think that they would 

apply the same standards that they would apply 

to other stare decisis inquiries, and I think it 

would be the rare case that would require --

that -- where a court would say this -- this 

decision not only isn't the best interpretation, 

but it's, like, so bad and so practically 

important that we're going to overturn our own 

precedent. 

So I think that would be the 

safeguard.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, when you say

 that the bottom-line holdings, you -- you've 

kind of changed the level of generality, right? 

If you say the bottom-line holding is that the 

agency's interpretation is lawful, you think 

it's not open to people to come back then and 

say, well, it's actually not lawful, this is 

wrong, the Court got it wrong because the best 

interpretation isn't the agency's 

interpretation? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I think litigants 

could make that argument, but I think they would 

have to overcome the normal stare decisis test, 

which is very hard to overcome, and so they 

would probably have to show that it's really 

wrong and really practically important. 

And I think most courts, and I imagine 

this Court, is -- is going to find that that 

threshold is -- is met, like, almost -- very 

rarely, maybe almost never.  And so, as a 

practical matter, you're not going to be

 MR. MARTINEZ:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So let's talk about

 the stare decisis threshold here.  Why is it 

different here than it was in Kisor?  You know, 

in Kisor, the Court declined to overrule Auer

majority of the Court was largely -- it was on 

stare decisis grounds. 

So why would a different result obtain 

here? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think my first answer 

is that the Chief Justice's opinion suggested it 

might be different and I think the reasons why 

it's -- it's reason -- it's -- it's -- it really 

is different is because there are important 

differences between Chevron and Auer. 

The most important that I think plays 

on the reliance question is this idea that 

Chevron allows and -- and almost like a feature

of Chevron, not a bug, is that it encourages and

 allows agencies to flip-flop.

 And so the reliance consideration with 

respect to Chevron is -- is much, you know,

 weaker for -- for -- for the government's side

 because the agency is allowed to flip-flop all 

at once, whereas, with Auer deference, the idea 

is that the agency -- it's going to be very hard 

for the agency to flip-flop.  So I think it's 

more important to correct Chevron because 

it's -- it has that mistake that Auer doesn't. 

There are other differences.  I -- you 

know, Chevron is problematic because it lets 

agencies say what Congress intended or what 

Congress's meaning was, as opposed to just 

saying what they themselves meant with the 

regulation that they themselves enacted. 

So I think the -- the kind of -- you 

know, the deference makes more sense when you're 

deferring to the entity that actually created 

the provision in question, as opposed to

Auer is limited to agency expertise.  So Auer

 is -- is narrower.

 And then, finally, I do think there's 

a difference even with respect to the APA, where 

I think the APA more clearly puts constitutional 

interpretation and statutory interpretation on 

equal footing, and that might play into the

 analysis.

 You know, this Court, the plurality 

in -- in Kisor sort of emphasized that -- that 

the APA was enacted after Seminole -- a year 

after Seminole Rock, and so maybe that was a 

basis to think that -- that Congress was okay 

with something that looked like Auer deference. 

But that's not true here.  Chevron came many 

years after the APA. 

So I think there are a lot of 

differences that really flesh out, I think, the 

important point that the Chief Justice was 

making, which was that the analysis there 

doesn't automatically transfer over to Chevron.

say several times that you agree that judges

 should not be doing policy, they should be doing 

law. And I guess I too agree with that, and my 

concern is that it's actually not as easy as it

 seems to distinguish between the two and -- and 

that it appears in a lot of your answers that 

you sort of say, well, you come up with the best 

answer, it's a legal question. But I'm not so 

sure it's a legal question, as opposed to is it 

the best under the sort of policy regime. 

And I think that there's a real 

separation-of-powers danger here to the extent 

that you're saying that the judges are deciding 

whether or not this is something the agency 

should do or not, whether this is a legal 

question or not. 

You know, there's the old saying that 

when you're a hammer, everything looks like a 

nail, and I'm concerned that judges are going to 

look at all of the questions related to a 

statute and call them legal if we don't have 

something like Chevron that requires judges to 

be actually thinking about their proper role 

relative to this issue. 

So how can you assuage my concern in

that regard?

 MR. MARTINEZ:  So I think two points. 

I think the first point I would make on the 

distinction between law and policy and how they 

kind of maybe seem like they blur together, I

 think that -- that there are just so many 

instances in which a court can get a question 

that comes before it that maybe it -- it 

involves an agency regime, but the agency hasn't 

acted yet. 

And I think the court in that 

circumstance just does its best. It doesn't 

have guidance, it doesn't have instructions from 

the agency.  It does its best.  And I think, 

when it does its best --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But does it have to, 

Mr. Martinez?  I mean, there are -- there are 

other regimes in which a court is presented with 

a question and it identifies it as a policy 

question that it cannot answer. 

MR. MARTINEZ:  But --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what I'm saying 

is that it's not necessarily true that just 

because the court gets an issue, it 

automatically says, oh, this must be legal, I

 MR. MARTINEZ:  But, if -- if the court

 got -- just to go back to Justice Kagan's

 hypothetical, the question of what -- what is a 

dietary supplement and the agency hadn't acted, 

I think the court would absolutely give meaning 

to that, and I don't think the court would think 

that what it's doing is making policy.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, let me give 

you a -- a particular example, all right?  In 

the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act situation, 

new drugs can be approved only if an adequate --

"adequate and well-controlled investigation" 

shows that the drug will have its attend --

intended effect. 

This term, what is an "adequate and 

well-controlled investigation," is it your view 

that Congress wanted the courts to decide what 

it means for a study to be adequate or 

well-controlled? 

I mean, how would a court go about 

determining whether that's something it's 

supposed to be doing or the agency is supposed 

to be doing?

kind of analysis there that it would do if it

 had that exact same statute without the agency

 acting.  And I think what that means is the 

court would go in and it would do everything

 that -- that we all agree happen -- should 

happen under step one.

 I think the only difference is that

 if, after doing that step one analysis, the 

court concludes that there's a better view and a 

less better view, then the court should just go 

with the better view.

one analysis and then the court makes the 

interpretive decision about what this means. 

And I guess --

MR. MARTINEZ:  I -- I -- I don't think

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So every statutory 

interpretation question is one of law that a

 court can decide, you're saying? 

MR. MARTINEZ: Yes, and that --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  There's never a

 statutory interpretation question that is one of 

policy that you see Congress may have been

 intending the agency to answer? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think, by definition, 

if we're talking about interpreting a statute, 

then you're talking about a legal question in 

the same way that if you're talking about 

interpreting the Constitution, then you have a 

constitutional question.  No one would say that 

you would apply deference there. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So there's never a 

world you -- I -- maybe we just differ on this. 

I'm worried about the courts becoming 

uber-legislators, that when we have a policy --

so one way that some of the experts have looked 

at this, some of the legal -- legal scholars 

have looked at this, is that they say, when 

there's an ambiguity, there are actually 

different kinds of ambiguities.

So you might have a situation in which 

there's a statutory term and it's ambiguous in

 the sense that it -- there are several 

reasonable meanings of what "stationary source"

 might mean, for example, several different ways 

that you could define that. When you get down 

to that level of analysis, the question is, 

who's going to make the choice as between what

 those meanings are? 

And I hear you saying there might be a 

best choice, but I guess, if we're talking about 

a policy question, there are several reasonable 

meanings, why should the court be the one to 

make that determination? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I --

we be in a world where Congress intended for the 

agency to actually decide which choice is best? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  I think where I --

where I would just sort of disagree is what you 

said at the end where you sort of assumed that 

it was a policy question.  I would just say that 

if it's -- if the question is the meaning of a 

statutory term, that's an interpretive question

a legal question if you got that exact same 

question before the agency had acted.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me 

ask you one more thing about practical 

implications. So let's say it is, you know, a

 legal question, as you have analyzed, "adequate

 and controlled investigations."  If I'm an 

agency and I'm trying to be responsible, how is

 this going to work as a practical matter?  Is 

the agency going to go to court every time it 

gets one of these undefined terms in a statute 

and seek, you know, a declaratory judgment as to 

the meaning of "adequate and controlled" -- and 

"well-controlled investigations" before it goes 

forward with its policy? 

MR. MARTINEZ:  No. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So the 

agency can come up with its own definition and 

implement it and then wait to be sued with 

respect to that, and -- and -- and every term

11 different, you know, jurisdictions that have 

legal authority.  So something like the 

definition of "adequate and well-controlled 

investigations," you say the courts will sort it 

out. 

Well, first of all, it will take years 

perhaps for the courts to sort it out. What is 

the agency supposed to be doing in the meantime? 

And different courts from all of these different 

jurisdictions could actually have a different 

view, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, of what 

"adequate and well-controlled investigations"

 small set of cases in which Chevron's going to 

make a difference, you're going to have that

in this Court's jurisprudence.  Overruling a 

precedent is never a small matter, but

 overruling a precedent as foundational as 

Chevron should require a truly extraordinary 

justification, and Petitioners don't have one.

 They say that Article III requires de 

novo review of all statutory interpretation

 questions.  But that's flatly inconsistent with

 precedent going back to the Marshall Court and 

with the traditional limits on mandamus 

jurisdiction, which governed most judicial 

review of executive action in the early 

republic. 

They've said that Chevron violates due 

process.  But the application of deferential 

standards of review doesn't constitute 

impermissible bias.  And they contend that the 

APA requires de novo review.  But that theory is 

inconsistent with the statute's history and the 

way it's been understood ever since its 

enactment, including in the more than 70 cases 

in which this Court has relied on Chevron to 

sustain an agency's interpretation. 

On top of all that, reliance interests 

in this context are at their apex.  Congress,

agencies, states, regulated parties, and the 

American public have all relied on Chevron and 

the regulations upheld under it to make 

important decisions that could be upended by

 overruling that framework. 

Thousands of judicial decisions

 sustaining an agency's rulemaking or

 adjudication as reasonable would be open to 

challenge, and that profound disruption is 

especially unwarranted because Congress could 

modify or overrule the Chevron framework at any 

time. Congress has many times considered 

proposals to do so, but it's never taken that 

step. 

Instead, Congress has legislated for 

decades with Chevron as the background rule 

informing the degree of discretion that Congress 

has chosen to confer on federal agencies. 

Just five years ago in Kisor, this 

Court declined similar calls to overrule the 

Auer deference doctrine based on many of the 

same flawed arguments that Petitioners are 

making here.  The Court observed that it would 

be the rare overruling that would introduce so 

much instability into so many areas of the law,

all in one blow.  Overruling Chevron would be an 

even greater and unwarranted shock to the legal

 system. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, Section 706 

of the APA was not mentioned in Chevron. How

 would you reconcile the requirements of -- on 

this -- on federal courts under 706 with your

 view of Chevron? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Section 706 says 

that courts should decide all relevant questions 

of law and interpret statutes, but none of that 

is inconsistent with the Chevron framework 

because 706 doesn't prescribe a universal 

standard of review to govern those kinds of 

statutory interpretation questions.  And the 

courts are interpreting statutes when they walk 

through the Chevron framework. 

First, there's all the work that the 

Court does at step one of Chevron.  That is 

using the tools of interpretation to identify 

whether Congress has spoken to the issue in the 

case and, if so, Chevron said that's the end of 

the matter. So, in that sense, in a step one 

case, the Court has, of course, interpreted the

 statute. 

But, in a situation where, at the end 

of that interpretive process, the Court is left 

with no conclusion that it's actually able to 

ascertain that Congress has spoken, then, in 

that circumstance, I think the right

 interpretation of the statute is that Congress 

left a gap or maybe created an ambiguity and

 simultaneously vested the agency with the 

important responsibility, pursuant to an express 

delegation, to administer that statute with the 

regulations that have the force of law. 

And that's what then tells the Court 

what the relevant question of law that's left 

over to resolve is.  It's whether the agency 

acted within the bounds that Congress itself 

prescribed. 

So I don't think there's any 

fundamental incompatibility with Section 706 and 

what Chevron dictates about how to think about 

Congress's delegations. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I say, 

counsel -- General, I know plenty of statutes 

where Congress uses the word "de novo."  It 

didn't here, correct, in 706?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought it, and 

I do think it, would be revolutionary to say

 that Congress can't limit judicial review.

 AEDPA is the quintessential question where we

 not only give deference to state court

 decisions, we say even if it got it wrong, if it 

didn't get it unreasonably wrong, we are

 superseding the court's ability to declare a 

violation of the Constitution and give relief. 

So I -- I -- I -- I think it would be 

radical to say that Congress couldn't implement 

Chevron.  In fact, it -- there is legislation to 

overrule Chevron, requiring de novo review, that 

hasn't passed.  There are statutes that 

basically don't -- say apply de novo review, 

correct? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there are 

statutes that require deferential review 

explicitly to legal questions, correct? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Besides Chevron?

we have -- we're now at 706. And my -- your

 adversary, your opposing counsel, said that he 

didn't see that much disruption from overruling 

Chevron, that nobody would really bring up those

 old cases.

 Do you have a view on that?

           GENERAL PRELOGAR: I think that my

 friend -- it's -- it might be easy for him to 

say that because he is not going to be involved 

in the endless litigation that I think would 

result if this Court were to overrule Chevron. 

I understand his point to be that all 

of the holdings in those cases will be secure 

because stare decisis will apply in those 

contexts.  But the important thing to realize is 

that in those cases, as Justice Barrett's 

questions emphasized, the Court has decided that 

what the agency did was reasonable.  The statute 

has essentially been interpreted to vest the 

agency with discretion such that the agency's 

regulation is being held lawful or valid on the 

basis of reasonableness, and I think that that 

means that litigants will come out of the 

woodwork seeking to open those decisions and 

contending that they didn't actually address

what they now say is the relevant question, not 

whether the agency's interpretation is

 reasonable or whether the regulation can be

 upheld on that basis, but how the statute should 

be interpreted without granting any deference to

 the agency's interpretation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'll 

ask you the same question I asked your friend. 

You began by saying Chevron is foundational. 

We get a lot of statutory 

interpretations from agencies, and I don't know 

whether it was 14 or 16 years, we haven't relied 

on Chevron over that time.  I -- I mean, have we 

overruled it in practice even if we've let the 

-- had to leave the lower courts to continue to 

grapple with it? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, I don't think 

so, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's been eight years 

since this Court relied on Chevron at step two, 

but there's no case that my friends have been 

able to point to where the Court has said that a 

statute was ambiguous or left a gap and Chevron 

would otherwise apply, but the Court is not 

going to defer in that circumstance.  So the 

fact that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But, I 

mean, that's simply a function of the fact, and 

-- when -- when we go through the work of trying 

to interpret what a statute means, when we get 

to the end, that seems to be the right

 interpretation, and --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I agree.  Those are

 step one holdings.  So I -- so I think that they 

are consistent with the Chevron framework. And 

the fact that this Court hasn't had a step two 

case in recent years in no way indicates that in 

those cases where Congress is, in fact, leaving 

ambiguities or gaps, Chevron no longer sets the 

right ground rule for understanding the scope of 

the delegation. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can I ask you 

about what I see as an internal inconsistency in 

Chevron itself?  It relates to Footnote 9, which 

is -- instructs that a court should look -- use 

all the traditional tools of statutory 

interpretation before getting to step two. 

My concern about that or my confusion 

about that is, if you use all the traditional 

tools of statutory interpretation, you'll get an 

answer, and we know that because, in cases where

we don't have an agency involved and we use

 those same traditional tools, we get an answer.

 So how do we deal with Footnote 9, 

which seems to suggest that you'll never get to 

step two if you follow Footnote 9 by what it

 says?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So what the Court 

said in Footnote 9 is that the Court should use 

all of the traditional tools to ascertain 

whether Congress had an intent on the issue. 

And that, of course, is an important 

part of this framework because, if Congress 

actually spoke to the issue, then the agency 

doesn't have any discretion to act in a way 

that's contrary to Congress's 

express directions. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you think 

that's different from ascertaining what the 

statute means? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that there 

can be a relevant difference and it touches on 

exactly what you were asking about in the 

context where a court has to do it without an 

agency. 

In that circumstance, I think it's

 absolutely right that the Court is ultimately

 going to keep working and decide how it thinks

 the statute should best be administered, even in 

the circumstance where there might be an

 ambiguity or a gap to fill.

 But what Chevron recognizes is that

 there is a third option available.  It's not 

just Congress spoke to the issue and it

 necessarily authorized what the agency did or 

Congress spoke to the issue and it prohibited 

what the agency did. 

There is a category of cases and 

statutes out there where, really, using all of 

the tools, the best interpretation of the 

statute is that Congress didn't resolve it. It 

left that gap or ambiguity and coupled it with 

this express authorization to the agency to 

carry that statute into effect.  This is 

Congress and the agencies working together hand 

in hand to put into effect this --

define "ambiguity" or how would you, if you were

what the Court said recently in Kisor where it 

said a statute is ambiguous when the Court has

 exhausted the tools of interpretation and hasn't

 found a single right answer.

 And I recognize, Justice Kavanaugh,

 and -- and you have expressed these concerns 

that there are some limits of language here and 

it's not subject to precise mathematical

 quantification, but that's because I think it's 

a standard that inherently requires the 

application of judgment. 

And at the end of the day, what the 

Court should be looking for and asking itself 

is, did Congress resolve this one?  Do I have 

confidence that actually I've got it, I -- I 

understand what Congress meant to say in this 

statute and it meant to prescribe a -- a uniform 

approach to "stationary source," that it has to 

be plant-wide or it has to be a particular piece 

of equipment? 

But, in a circumstance like Chevron 

itself with "stationary source" or some of the 

examples that the Justices have been talking 

about with "reasonable" or "feasible," I think 

you can get to the end of that process and the

the right way to understand this statute is that

 it's conferring discretion on the agency to take 

a range of permissible approaches.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you -- do you 

think it's possible for a judge to say, the best 

reading of the statute is X, but I think it is 

ambiguous, and, therefore, I'm going to defer to

 the agency, which has offered Y? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, I think that 

that would probably --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: That can't happen? 

I think that happens all the time. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think that 

there are two different ways in which courts use 

the term "best interpretation of the statute." 

So, if what you're asking me is, is there a 

world in which a judge could go through the 

rigorous step one inquiry, apply all of the 

tools, and say, I think there's a best 

interpretation insofar as I think Congress spoke 

to the issue, but the agency's interpretation is 

it could be permissible, I recognize there's 

some doubt here, the answer is no.

a better interpretation.  I provide it as a

 court. The other is: Well, yeah, but I'm going

 to defer anyway given whatever considerations 

you want to throw into the ambiguity bucket.

 And that's exactly the problem that

 your friends on the other side suggest have

 persisted in the lower courts for 40 years and 

why some judges claim never to have found an

 ambiguity and other equally excellent circuit 

judges have said they find them all the time. 

And it's also why, I don't know, maybe 

a dozen or more circuit judges have written 

asking us to overrule Chevron.  And -- and --

and -- and -- and it also may be why one of your 

colleagues last year said, I don't know what 

"ambiguity" means at this lectern. 

And should that be a clue that 

something needs to be fixed here, that even the 

federal government at the podium can't answer 

the question what triggers ambiguity? 

You've given us two different 

alternatives today, and so many lower court 

judges who just want to follow whatever we tell 

them to do faithfully can't figure it out.

packed in there, Justice Gorsuch, and I want to 

respond to each of your concerns.

 First, I would draw from Chevron and

 Kisor in defining what is an ambiguity.  It is 

when a court has applied the tools of 

construction and can't ascertain that Congress

 had an intent on the matter.  So I think that 

that is the core question for a court at step 

one of Chevron, and if that's the circumstance, 

that would only ever move a court to applying 

deference at step two. 

Now I understand the concern you 

expressed that maybe lower courts are too 

reflexively finding that there's 

ambiguity because --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, you gave us a 

second definition just a moment ago, and --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I was trying to --

to explain how I thought that sometimes --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- we done that,

 like -- like, 15 times over the last eight or 10 

years, say, really, really, really, go look at 

all the statutory tools? And yet, here, we have 

a case, two cases, one in which one court found

 ambiguity and went to step two and another one

 which -- well, I can't tell what it did, but

 there's a pretty good argument it -- it tried to

 resolve it at step one. 

So, even in a case involving herring 

fishermen and the question whether they have to 

pay for government officials to be onboard their 

boats, which may call for some expertise, but it 

doesn't have much to do with fishing or 

fisheries, it has to do with payments of --

of -- of government costs, we -- we -- lower 

court judges even here in this rather prosaic 

case can't figure out what Chevron means. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I do think 

that issuing a reminder to courts about the 

thoroughness --

behalf of the government that we have canvassed

 the litigating components and looked at the

 lower court case law, and after Kisor, lower 

courts granted Auer deference far less 

frequently, so I think it can matter and that 

lower courts can get that kind of message if 

you're worried about it.

 But, Justice Gorsuch, the other point 

to add here is that if you are concerned that 

lower courts have different reactions in trying 

to implement Chevron at step one, I think it's 

important to think about the alternative as 

well. It's not as though, if this Court 

overrules Chevron, that's going to get rid of 

statutory gaps or ambiguities.

this Court's understood it, is a recipe for

 anti-reliance.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I disagree with

 that characterization about Brand X, and I think

 my friends have created -- kicked up some dust

 about exactly what Brand X does --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So you do --

           GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- and doesn't do.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- you do endorse 

Brand X, the government does? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I think it is 

a logical follow-on of Chevron, and here is why. 

As Brand X itself recognizes, if the court has 

found at step one that Congress spoke to the 

issue, there's no room under Brand X for the 

agency to reverse the court or somehow change 

the underlying meaning of the statute.  Instead, 

the statute has been interpreted at step one and 

what Congress says goes. 

It's only in the category of step two 

cases where Brand X comes into play, and in that 

circumstance, it's because the court in the 

prior case has understood the statute to leave a 

gap or an ambiguity for the agency to fill, 

considering a range of regulatory approaches.

So, in that circumstance too, the meaning of the

 statute doesn't change.  It remains a gap for 

the agency to fill at time two, and if the

 agency is running through all of the procedural 

hoops, which can be quite burdensome in this 

context, to change its regulatory approach, it 

is still acting consistently with the --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or not.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- with the 

discretion. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or not if it -- if 

it issues an interpretive rule without 

notice-and-comment or issues an adjudication. 

It may or may not be that burdensome, right? 

So Brand X also says you -- that an 

agency can overturn a prior judicial 

interpretation.  And I -- I saw that as a 

circuit judge with respect to an alien who was 

allowed into the country under the Tenth 

Circuit's understanding of the law.  And the 

government come back and says, no, you have to 

overturn your precedent, Tenth Circuit, and he's 

not allowed in the country.  And we had to

 understanding of the law too, that judicial 

precedents, maybe even precedents of this Court, 

can be overturned by agencies?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It depends on what 

the judicial precedent held. If it held at step

 one that that statute was clear, then of course

 not. But Brand X doesn't require that result.

 If the prior precedent held that 

Congress didn't resolve the issue and it 

delegated to the agency the responsibility and 

role in administering it and filling the gap, 

including with the possibility of changing 

regulatory approaches based on things like 

change --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But the reality --

just to pick up on that, the reality is -- you 

-- you say don't overrule Chevron because it 

would be a shock to the system, but the reality 

of how this works is Chevron itself ushers in 

shocks to the system every four or eight years 

when a new administration comes in, whether it's 

communications law or securities law or 

competition law or environmental law, and goes 

from pillar to post, like Professor Pierce 

wrote, and he had been a fan of Chevron.  Now

extreme instability in the law. That's his --

his phrase.

 And it just seems like you just pay

 attention to what happens when a new 

administration comes in at EPA, at SEC, at FTC,

 you name it.  It's just massive change.  That is 

at war with reliance. That is not stability. 

And so I think to hold up stability and reliance 

is a little tough given just watching how it 

operates every four years. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, let me give 

you a couple of different reactions to that.  I 

think that that is a small sliver of cases or 

circumstances.  And in the mine run case 

involving agency regulations, agencies 

themselves build on those regulations as a 

foundation.  There's no evidence that agencies 

are out there flip-flopping left and right or 

doing so on a whim. 

And it brings me to the important 

point that to do --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- and I'll let 

you finish. But I don't think they're doing it

 on a whim.  I think they're doing it because 

they have disagreement with the policy of the

 prior administration and they're using what

 Chevron gives them and what they can't get

 through Congress to do it themselves, self-help, 

and to do it themselves unilaterally, which is 

completely inconsistent with bicameralism and 

presentment to get your policy objectives 

enacted into law. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But, Justice 

Kavanaugh, the premise I think that's embedded 

in that question is the idea that Congress had 

spoken to that issue. And in a circumstance 

where Congress didn't resolve it and, in fact, 

wanted the agency to have flexibility and a 

range of options, there's nothing inherently 

problematic or incompatible with our system of 

government to recognize that agencies can carry 

out those directives. 

And just look at "stationary source." 

You know, that was a circumstance where the 

Court said, applying all of the tools, Congress 

didn't have a view on it. It didn't want to

 foreclose a plant-wide definition.  It didn't 

want to foreclose an equipment-specific 

definition. And I think it was entirely 

permissible for the expert agency to come in, 

take stock of the entire situation, and, yes,

 take account of the policy goals of an incoming 

administration to better account for the

 interests of the regulated parties and give them

 flexibility.  That's just part of Congress's 

design. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  After all, you know, 

taking into account the policy goals of the new 

administration reflects a democratic structure 

where we have the new administration being 

elected by the people on the basis of certain 

policy determinations. 

I guess my concern is I suppose 

judicial policymaking is very stable but 

precisely because we are not accountable to the 

people and have lifetime appointments.  So, if 

we have gaps and ambiguities in statutes and the 

judiciary is coming in to fill them, I suppose 

we would have a -- something of a separation of 

powers or policy -- excuse me -- separation-of-

powers concern related to judicial policymaking.

Am I wrong to be worried about that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. I think that 

that concern is valid, and I think it's valid

 along two separate dimensions, and one is to 

recognize that in these scenarios where we're at 

Chevron step two, by definition, it's because 

the statute itself doesn't supply an answer and

 the court can't ascertain that Congress actually

 meant to resolve it. And in that circumstance, 

it's entirely sensible for Congress to give the 

issue to an agency when it is charged with 

administering the statute and, of necessity, is 

going to have to fill the gap along the way. 

And Congress could quite legitimately want the 

agency to draw on its policymaking expertise in 

figuring out the right way to fill the gap. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What do you -- what 

do you say to Mr. Martinez, who says we've 

already characterized that as a question of law 

because the court was involved at step one in 

making the determination, and so it seems a 

little odd -- I think I took this away from his 

presentation -- to suddenly say, when we're in a 

step two gap-filling world, now we're going to 

call it a policy question as opposed to a legal

one?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think you can

 still characterize it as a legal question while

 recognizing that in a circumstance, to borrow 

Justice Kagan's words, where the law has run out 

and Congress hasn't actually spoken to the 

issue, the court, if it resolves that issue, is 

-- is going to have to draw on a set of 

considerations to inform its judgment. 

And I wouldn't call it policymaking, 

but I do think it means that the court can't 

suggest that the answer it is giving is 

absolutely dictated on that precise issue by 

Congress because, by definition, we're in a 

world where Congress didn't speak to it.  So the 

court will have to take account of a narrower 

range of circumstances, things like the 

overarching statutory objectives, to try to fill 

in the gap. 

But the point is that when Congress 

has left that gap and charged the expert agency 

with the administration role, Congress could 

have every expectation, and Chevron says 

Congress has the expectation, that the agency 

will fill the gap and that the courts will

that always apply in this context.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  General Prelogar,

 most scholars of statutory interpretation

 consider Chevron to be an interpretive canon,

 much like clear statement rules, rule of lenity, 

judicially created. Do you see Chevron that 

way? And, if so, do you see it as different in 

kind from any of the other canons of 

interpretation that we apply? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I do think it is 

different. I don't conceive of it as a canon. 

Instead, I think that it is fundamentally rooted 

in -- in kind of setting the ground rules for 

how all three branches of the government are 

operating together. 

And what I understand the Court to 

have been doing in Chevron is recognizing that 

there are legitimate reasons why Congress cannot 

answer every question itself and why it will 

want to go hand in hand with an agency by 

charging that agency with administering the 

statute.  And in that circumstance, it's the 

role of the court to give effect to that. 

So I think it's not just kind of an

 interpretive canon, but, rather, it really is

 grounded in the separation of powers.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So is it dependent 

on a judgment about what Congress would want, 

one that would have to be empirically tested?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I don't think 

that it's getting into Congress's subjective 

intent, although, certainly, I think the primary 

rationale that Chevron gave was its appraisal 

that this is, as an overarching matter, what 

Congress would have intended when it comes to 

gaps. 

And I don't mean to suggest that this 

means that Congress thinks about each and every 

gap it's creating in the moment. Sometimes I 

think it does and it's clear when it says set 

reasonable rates.  It knows that it's not itself 

prescribing what those rates will be in concrete 

circumstances.  It's leaving gaps and the agency 

has to fill it. 

But I think, even in the circumstance 

where Congress doesn't know it's creating it at 

the time, someone's going to have to come in

 circumstance, I think the court appropriately 

recognized Congress would want for the agency to

 do it.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  And how do we know 

-- this is -- goes back to that question of what 

is the trigger of ambiguity that Justice Gorsuch

 was asking you. 

So think about a concrete example like 

Pulsifer, which the United States is on the 

other side, pending before the Court, turning on 

what "and" joins together. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We think that one's 

clear. Put it out there. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So let's -- let's 

put aside the question of whether, you know, the 

Department of Justice and the Executive can --

gets deference in interpreting criminal 

statutes.  Just erase that issue from the 

picture. 

Is that the kind of question -- you 

know, judges below, very smart, very reasonable 

judges reached different conclusions about what 

that word in the statute meant.  Is that the

 Brand X saying, well, it doesn't have to be the

 best, it just has to be, you know, a plausible, 

reasonable one, is that the kind of statutory 

question that would trigger ambiguity and step

 two deference?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think it's

 hard to speak in -- in generalities about this. 

And I am struggling because, of course, the 

Court has recognized that the -- the Department 

of Justice does not get deference in the 

criminal context. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.

 give you to know when the statutory 

interpretation exercise at step one runs out and

 the court should feel like, I don't have an 

answer, Congress didn't supply one, and when

 not. I think it's going to vary based on the

 statutory scheme.

 But, in each case, the court should 

conduct that inquiry, make it a thorough inquiry 

and take account of all of the relevant aspects 

of interpretation that can bear on meaning and 

show that Congress, in fact, did resolve it. 

That is the role of the court, and 

it's the role of the court likewise to enforce 

Congress's directions when --

question, putting aside the government's

structure, the placement of a comma, you know,

 that kind of a thing, that is the kind of 

question that, depending on the circumstance,

 could trigger step two deference?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think it

 conceivably could. Now I want to hold open and 

acknowledge that the Court has said there are 

certain types of statutory questions that don't 

fit within the Chevron framework because there 

are kind of statute-specific reasons to think 

Congress wasn't giving this question to the 

agency. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think the Major 

Questions Doctrine is a species of that.  I'd 

point to the Adams Fruit case as well, where it 

was a judicial review provision, and the Court 

said this wasn't something for the agency to do. 

But I think, in the mine run case, 

yes, and -- and to the extent you're saying, 

well, it feels odd for it to depend on a comma 

or to turn on the meaning of the word "and," 

still I think the inference holds because, in 

that context, Congress, if -- if it, in fact, 

has left the ambiguity or the gap, recognizes

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Except a lot of

 times Congress doesn't intentionally leave the

 ambiguity or the gap, right?  It's just limits 

of language, limits of foresight.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think a 

-- so I think a court ultimately, if it's able 

to ascertain that, although it's not perfectly 

clear in the statute, you can figure out what 

Congress intended, give effect to that, that's 

step one. 

At least Congress knows that if it's 

going to unintentionally create ambiguities or 

gaps, Chevron is the stable background rule. 

It's been the rule for 40 years. This Court 

acknowledged in City of Arlington that Congress, 

in fact, legislates against the background of 

that rule, and so it knows that with anything 

it's doing that's unintentional, that will

 same statutory interpretation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead and

 finish, sure.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Same statutory 

interpretation issue in a non-agency case, could 

the Court decide it? 

And if the answer is yes, the Court 

could decide it, then the law hasn't run out, 

so, therefore, you could ask yourself that 

question in an agency case.  If this were a 

non-agency case, would we come to an answer on 

this case?  And if so, you don't go to step two. 

What's wrong with that?  And if that's 

not correct, because I don't think you're going 

to agree with that --

That's the problem.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So you

 predicted my answer.  I don't agree that it's 

only in a circumstance where the statute would 

be incapable of the Court issuing a decision at 

the end of day. Of course, if a case comes to 

the Court and it has to resolve it, it's going 

to have to do its level best.

 But what I meant by the law running 

out is that if the Court has walked through all 

of the tools of construction and interpretation 

and doesn't think that Congress actually 

directly spoke to this issue, Congress itself 

didn't resolve it, then the kinds of tools the 

Court is going to have to use will be ones that 

sound in things like the overarching statutory 

objectives that Congress revealed as part of its 

plan. 

And I think that in a -- a Chevron 

circumstance, the insight of the Court's opinion 

there was that the Court doesn't have to go on 

and itself supply the answer when, actually, the 

best way to understand Congress having not 

resolved it itself was to make the primary 

decision-maker or the -- the person with the

primary role in the first instance to be the

 agency. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 Justice Thomas, anything further?

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Just a -- a couple of

 questions.  You said that -- in an exchange with

 Justice Sotomayor and me that Congress could 

require some deference when it came to questions 

of statutory interpretation. 

And in 706, it -- it -- the reviewing 

court shall decide all relevant questions of 

law, interpret constitutional and statutory 

provisions, et cetera.  Could Congress also 

require deference on the part of the court with 

respect to constitutional issues? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that 

that would raise distinct issues in light of the 

different history that would be in play in that 

kind of hypothetical.  There has not been a 

longstanding history of courts deferring to 

agencies when it comes to interpreting the

But the -- the history runs in

 precisely the opposite direction when it comes 

to statutory interpretation, where agencies 

themselves are charged with administering it 

because, as we've tried to explain, Chevron was

 not an innovation, it was not something new.

 These principles of deference go all

 the way back to the -- the very founding years

 of the republic.  They're reflected in things 

like mandamus practice, where virtually all 

executive action for the first hundred years of 

our nation's history was reviewed deferentially, 

and then it was continued in a long line of 

cases from this Court recognizing specifically 

that in a circumstance when you have the 

Executive administering the statute, Congress 

could delegate and could expect for those 

delegations to be respected. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think mandamus is a 

little bit different and the -- the other 

extraordinary writs in that they -- that you had 

quite a high hurdle before they became 

applicable, but back to -- we normally say that 

this Court reviews questions of law de novo, and 

that includes statutory and constitutional.

How would you distinguish that normal

 practice from what you're saying?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think it is 

more nuanced than that. I certainly take the 

point that the Court reviews many legal

 questions de novo, but that's not invariably the

 case. There can be issues that arise under 

distinct statutes that set forth more

 deferential standards of review. AEDPA is a 

good example of that. 

It -- there can be circumstances like 

mandamus, where the nature of the action itself 

dictates a more deferential standard of review. 

And I just don't think it would be accurate to 

say, as a uniform, across-the-board matter, de 

novo is the standard that always and invariably 

applies.  That's inconsistent with cases from 

this Court that were cited in Chevron, going 

back to the early 1800s, things like Edwards' 

Lessee versus Darby, where the Court itself was 

recognizing that in a variety of contexts where 

you have ambiguity in particular and you have an 

expert agency charged with administering the 

statute, deference can be warranted. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can you provide a

 concise definition of what "ambiguity" means in

 this context?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Ambiguity exists 

when the court has exhausted the tools of 

interpretation and hasn't been able to arrive at 

confidence that there is a right answer that

 Congress spoke to the issue. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, as Justice 

Kavanaugh's recent question presented, in cases 

that don't involve an agency, we never say we 

have exhausted all of our tools of 

interpretation and we just can't figure out what 

this means.  So that would seem to suggest you 

never get to step two. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But the relevant 

question at step one is whether Congress is, in 

fact, resolving it or delegating it to the 

agency. So I agree that in a circumstance where 

you don't have an agency, the Court can't give 

effect to any delegation and, instead, the 

backup option in a situation where an agency 

would otherwise be available is the Court has to 

do it, but I don't think that that undermines

the best way to try to clarify what the

example of something like a statutory term --

 out what Congress intended.  Is -- is that what

 that Chevron prescribes that you should be

which is another formulation of this, use the 

tools of interpretation to see if they reveal 

Congress's --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what do you mean 

by what Congress intended?  Do you mean -- do 

you mean to say that you get to step two 

whenever we don't think that a majority of the 

House and a majority of the Senate had an intent 

on the specific question that is before the 

court? Then you'd always get to step two. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. So I don't 

think it's about individual legislators' intent. 

I think the Court in Chevron used the word 

"Congress," but you're really looking at the 

statute and what the statute reveals about 

whether it's resolving an issue or not.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There hasn't been 

much discussion on why this is entitled to

 statutory -- to stare decisis consideration. 

There's been an argument by opposing --

 Petitioners that it's not because -- it's not 

really a holding of a case, it's a method only, 

and we have said in the past that a method that 

lower courts have to use is subject to change 

in -- change we can make without considering 

stare decisis. 

So could you address that argument? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think 

that Petitioners have pointed to two relevant 

types of cases that they suggest just mean stare 

decisis doesn't apply here or it applies in 

particularly weakened form. 

First, they say the Court has 

sometimes changed the interpretive tools it 

consults.  Things like legislative history might 

have been in greater favor at least with some 

Justices before and maybe have fallen out of 

favor later.

But I don't think that those provide a 

parallel at all because the Court has never

 distilled those kinds of interpretive tools into

 a governing framework.  It's never, for example, 

dictated to lower courts you should be applying

 legislative history in all cases.  And so I 

don't think that it has the same kind of roots 

in the type of binding governing framework that

 Chevron has, which really has functioned in 

quite a different way with respect to how you 

understand and implement Congress's directives. 

The second case they pointed to is 

Pearson, which held, in the context of the 

Saucier rule, that that was entitled to weakened 

stare decisis.  But, there, the Court said that 

is entirely a rule of internal judicial 

management about how courts decide issues and 

sequence their decision-making process.  It 

doesn't have outward-looking consequences, and 

it would be foolish to require Congress to step 

in to fix it. 

There too, I think that the 

considerations run in precisely the opposite

conduct their business; it also gives notice to

 the legislature about how its statutes will be

 construed.  And if the Court got this wrong when 

Chevron was decided and was wrong about

 legislative intent, Congress is there at the

 ready and is perhaps the best part or 

institution in government to be able to correct

 it and actually say going forward what it wants 

the ground rules to be. 

And the final thing I would say, 

Justice Sotomayor, is that these were precisely 

the kinds of considerations that the Court took 

into account in Kisor in applying the strongest 

form of stare decisis to Auer deference. 

My friends have largely ignored 

Kisor's analysis on this.  This was the majority 

of the Court where the Court said Congress can 

step in, these deference decisions are balls 

that are lobbed into Congress's courts, and 

there are big reliance interests at stake here 

because there are dozens in that case, here 

thousands, of decisions that could stand to be 

displaced and create chaos if Chevron is 

overruled.  So I think that from a stare decisis 

perspective, that precedent counts as precedent

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There -- and you

 answered the reliance question, because one of 

the arguments on the other side is no one has --

 well, the first argument, that the Court hasn't 

applied Chevron in how many years and so nobody 

should have a legitimate reliance interest. And 

the second argument against reliance is that no

 one should have reliance on a wrong 

interpretation basically. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think 

that those kinds of arguments are inconsistent 

with Kisor and also inconsistent with what we 

know about what happens in the real world.  You 

know, there are agency regulations out there 

that have been on the books for decades.  People 

have made investment decisions on the basis of 

that. People have decided what contracts to 

enter into on the basis of that. States in 

cooperative federalism programs have designed 

and invested their resources into their share of 

that program. 

And all of that could be thrown into 

disarray if now it can be subject to renewed 

challenge on the basis that that regulation was

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's been a fair 

bit of talk, General, about how, because you

 don't have a formula for saying when there's a 

gap or ambiguity so that you go to step two or 

because judges may have different tendencies, 

you know, which might be temperamental as much 

as anything else to find ambiguity, because of 

that, there's going to be some variability.  And 

it's hard to argue that will be -- there will be 

some variability, but could you talk about the 

variability in the alternative scenario? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And -- and I 

think that this is a really important point to 

focus on because, as I was trying to say 

earlier, in a world without Chevron, it's not as 

though Congress is always going to speak clearly 

and it won't leave gaps or ambiguities in 

statutes, genuine ambiguities where you apply 

the tools and, at the end, you are left with no

 certainty about what Congress was trying to do.

 And in that circumstance in a world 

without Chevron, what we'll see is what Justice

 Alito was suggesting, the courts will have to go

 on and try to answer the question.  But there 

are 800 district court judges around the nation, 

and I think it's fair to say they will likely 

have different takes about what to do in that

 circumstance and what to give greater weight to 

and how to ultimately fill the gap in 

administering the statute, and that's going to 

create problems for a couple of different 

reasons. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And those differences, 

to go back to Justice Alito's earlier question, 

I mean, those differences were part of the 

impetus for Chevron because those differences 

were looking awfully ideological in nature, 

awfully partisan in nature, and Chevron, all the 

empirical evidence suggests, dampens that kind 

of ideological division between courts. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right. 

There is good empirical evidence to support that 

judges have an easier time reaching common 

ground under the Chevron framework and at least

 identifying when they can agree that Congress 

did not itself resolve an issue than they do 

when they have to ultimately go on and try to 

figure out what they are going to say is the 

bottom line of the best way to put the statute

 into operation. 

So I think that that is rooted in

 Chevron, and it just reflects as well this 

uniformity concern, one of the basic 

justifications for Chevron and one of the 

reasons why this inference of legislative intent 

is sound, because agencies can provide that kind 

of uniform rule for the nation, subject to the 

ground rules, of course, of judicial review 

under Chevron.  But I think that the alternative 

world where there's no Chevron is that there 

will open up wide disputes among the lower 

courts, maybe on these mine-run statutory 

interpretation questions in complex programs, 

things like Medicare and Medicaid, and I think 

that it could mean that regulated parties are 

subject to different rules in different parts of 

the country.  You lose the uniformity value, and 

it -- it diminishes the force of the political 

accountability value.

 gave, I think, were AEDPA and mandamus, right?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I think those 

are two good examples --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- of situations 

where there are specifications of a standard of

 review that's more deferential.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I wonder whether, 

though, those have more to do with remedies, 

right? In a mandamus case, a court should say 

or can say what the law is.  It just can't 

provide relief unless its conviction about the 

statute meaning is sufficiently clear.  Same 

thing in AEDPA, that we require a heightened 

standard before relief is granted.  Same thing 

in sovereign immunity contexts.  We may think 

the statute says the government's liable, but we 

impose a higher standard before we grant access 

to the fisc. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I acknowledge 

that I think that many of those doctrines do 

turn on limitations built into the writ or 

limitations on remedies.  I don't think it would 

be right, Justice Gorsuch, to say that in the

APA and what it means, and --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah.  Okay. So

 sorry if I misunderstood.  I -- I do think,

 though, that what the history shows at the very 

least is there has been no fundamental rule in 

this country leading up to the APA's enactment 

that you have to review all questions de novo. 

And that's where the history of the APA really

 matters. 

This Court has several times 

recognized the APA was a restatement of existing 

judicial practice when it came to review of 

agency statutory interpretations.  And as we've 

explained, there are really deep roots here, a 

long line of precedent and history showing that 

courts will sometimes defer. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  On -- on 

those --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think to say 

that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- on those, it's --

it's absolutely true, you -- you -- you do point 

out cases like Edwards' Lessee and others where 

this Court gave respect to the federal 

government's contemporaneous and uniform

 And that's exactly what Skidmore does. 

It gives respect to contemporaneous and uniform

 interpretations.  But Chevron, it doesn't matter

 whether it's contemporaneous and uniform.  It

 could be novel and out of the blue and 

inconsistent with everything that came before, 

and it still gets deference, right? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I disagree

more limited principle that's -- that's --

add as well --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I have another

 question, though.  Chevron, you emphasize, is --

is value-neutral and it'll sometimes favor

 industries that are regulated and sometimes

 favor the government.

 And I can certainly see that in -- in

 scenarios where we talk about the flip-flop of

 administrations and new people leave -- come in 

and replace others and -- and there's a lot of 

movement from industry in and out of those 

agencies.  I -- I think George Stigler talked 

about regulatory capture. 

And I -- I don't worry in a Chevron 

regime about those people.  They can take care 

of themselves, okay?  There is political 

account, fine. 

The cases I saw routinely on the 

courts of appeals -- and I think this is what 

niggles at so many of the lower court judges --

are the immigrant, the veteran seeking his 

benefits, the Social Security Disability 

applicant, who have no power to influence 

agencies, who will never capture them, and whose 

interests are not the sorts of things on which

 And, there, Chevron is almost always

 and, in fact, I -- I didn't see a case cited, 

and perhaps I missed one, where Chevron wound up 

benefitting those kinds of peoples. And it 

seems to me that it's arguable, and, certainly,

 the other side makes this argument powerfully,

 that Chevron has this disparate impact on

 different classes of persons, and I wanted to 

give you a chance to respond to that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Sure, and I have a 

couple of different reactions to that.  You 

know, one is to say that I, of course, 

acknowledge that the way that Chevron operates, 

it gives effect to agency interpretations even 

in circumstances where that might be 

oppositional, some of the categories of 

individuals that you're identifying. 

But, if it does that, it does that in 

accordance with Congress's intent and wishes 

because even my friend agrees that there are 

certain delegations that Congress can make to 

agencies and -- and certain gap-filling that 

agencies can do at least with the broad and 

capacious terms, and at that point, it's just

 So I don't think that there is any 

kind of fundamental flaw in giving effect to 

Congress's statutes in that regard.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But you've left open 

the possibility that a judge, if left to his own 

devices, would say the fairest ruling is in 

favor of the immigrant, it's in favor of the 

veteran, and it's in favor of the Social 

Security Disability applicant, but because of a 

fictionalized statement about what Congress 

wanted when it didn't think about the problem, 

the government always wins. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think there 

are a couple of different ways to come at that 

concern.  One is to emphasize again that if it's 

not just that in the exercise of discretion the 

Court would think something is fairer and fill 

the gap that way, but, rather, the Court thinks 

actually the reason it's fairer is because I 

have a -- a -- a sense that Congress spoke to 

this, I can determine it based on all of the 

tools, you can --

I think the other side's argument suggests that 

the basic analytical concern at the heart of

 Chevron is that it treats law as policy and that 

that's antithetical to our constitutional

 structure and the rule of law.

 And that's why the Footnote 9 question 

is so important, I think, because, if you use

 the traditional tools in a non-agency case and 

got an answer, that suggests it's a statutory 

interpretation question. 

And you're saying no, you can stop 

short of that in an agency case at some 

difficult-to-define point and then treat the 

rest of the case as a -- as a policy call for 

the executive branch. 

And that's treating what was a law 

question in a non-agency case as a policy 

question in an agency case, and it's the same 

question.  So it's transforming law into policy. 

And that's very difficult, I think, to accept if 

you accept the idea that a premise of the rule 

of law is that the executive and the judiciary 

can't just treat the laws passed by Congress as 

mere expressions of policy that they can change. 

Respond to that.

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I hear that 

concern, and I think the way to address that 

concern is to reinforce the principle in

 Footnote 9.

 We agree that that's an important

 principle.  And to the extent that there are 

agencies out there or lower courts out there

 that are effectively not giving the -- the 

effect to Congress's own enactments, then a 

court can police that and it can put into effect 

the Footnote 9 principle in a robust way with a 

rigorous analysis. That's the kind of 

instruction the Court gave in Kisor. 

And, Justice Kavanaugh, I think it's 

not a -- a different question in the agency 

context and in the non-agency context.  What I 

understand Chevron to be doing is telling the 

court in the first instance figure out if 

Congress spoke to this issue and, if so, 

implement it, but hold open the possibility that 

Congress didn't speak to the issue. 

And in that context, if Congress has 

given the agency this primary critically 

important role to administer the statute, that 

should merit deference if the agency still stays

within the bounds that Congress set.

 In a non-agency case, you don't have 

the agency to rely on, but you might still end

 up at the end of the interpretive process 

thinking Congress didn't precisely speak to this 

issue, but what is the best I can do to figure 

out how Congress would have resolved it or what

 is the interpretation most consistent with the 

overall statutory scheme here? 

The right way to resolve this case, 

Congress, in fact, would know that courts are 

going to have to do that in a context without an 

agency, and so it's still following the terms of 

the statute, but I think it would be a fiction 

to suggest that what the Court is doing there is 

just following Congress's explicit directions on 

the matter --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, can I ask --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- because that's 

at war with the idea that there is genuine 

ambiguity sometimes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.  And I think 

it's important to distinguish, and I think you 

would distinguish, statutes that involve legal 

questions of statutory interpretation and then

there are tons of statutes, to go back to the AI 

example, that explicitly confer broad policy

 discretion on agencies.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  Yes.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And that's where 

State Farm kicks in, and that's where we've

 always been deferential. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, correct.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And you 

acknowledge those are two different kinds of 

statutes, a statute that says -- for example, 

one statute might say no -- no one can catch 

more than 50 fish today, the next statute may 

say the agency can define what a reasonable 

number of fish that can be caught in a 

particular day.  That second statute's 

conferring broad policy discretion to define the 

limit on the agency. 

You agree those are distinct? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I -- I think 

that one is obviously a clearer bestowal of 

discretion on the agency, but I think it just 

shows that Congress can legislate in a variety 

of ways.

 you right there?  And -- and so you agree 

Congress can legislate broad policy discretion

 to an agency, can -- can grant broad policy

 discretion explicitly through words like

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And I think that 

the same question of what does the court do 

without the agency can sometimes come up in 

those contexts.  If Congress has said, to -- to 

borrow from the Chief Justice's example, 

reasonable truck lengths and, you know, there 

isn't an agency interpretation of that, the 

court's going to have to do its best.

 Okay. Two more questions because I 

want to make sure the concerns of the other side

 So there's some discussion of this

 would be taking power from the executive and 

granting it to the judiciary.  I guess a 

different conception of this, of Chevron, is 

that it's taken power from Congress and shifted 

it to the executive and allowed the executive, 

in essence, to unilaterally make policy without 

Congress. 

And one of the concerns historically 

from the beginning of this country was unchecked 

executive power, and you hear presidents 

criticized all the time, whether it's -- you 

know, Roosevelt or Reagan or Bush or Obama are 

criticized for exercising unchecked power.  So 

the concern is, about Chevron, in essence 

ushering in aggressive assertions of unilateral 

executive power, and that's the concern that I 

think the other side has, not about the

judiciary taking power but the judiciary having 

taken it from Congress and shifted it to the 

executive, contrary to our usual concerns.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I disagree with 

their characterization that Chevron permits the 

executive to claim power away from Congress and 

Congress is powerless to do anything about that. 

You know, in the first instance, of course, 

Congress has to make the delegation to the 

agency, and the Court can enforce that. And so 

Congress knows, as this Court has said in City 

of Arlington, to speak capaciously when it wants 

to bestow discretion, to speak plainly when it 

wants to rein an agency in and resolve an issue 

itself, and also Congress can change the rules 

of deference that apply in any context. 

There have been particular statutory 

schemes where Congress has said deference 

doesn't exist in this context, don't apply it, 

or defer to this agency and not this other 

agency.  So -- so Congress is really in the 

driver's seat here. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, most -- this 

is a technical point.  Most presidents would 

veto a bill getting rid of Chevron deference and

so -- but that's a technical point.  But last --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- last -- last

 question, which is there was talk about

 democratically elected political branches, but I 

just want to get your agreement on something 

that I think you'll agree on, which it's the 

role of the judiciary historically under the 

Constitution to police the line between the 

legislature and the executive to make sure that 

the executive is not operating as a king, not 

operating outside the bounds of the authority 

granted to them by the legislature. 

Do you agree that's a proper judicial 

role, I would assume? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I, of course, agree 

with that, but I think Chevron is consistent 

with that.  The court polices the executive at 

step one by ensuring that Congress's own choices 

are put into operation, and it further polices 

the executive at step two. As the Court said in 

Kisor, reasonableness is a test that agencies 

can fail.  And so there's work to be done --

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you very

 much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Barrett?

 Justice Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So just picking up

 where Justice Kavanaugh left off, doesn't the

 Court have to not only police the other branches 

but itself as well?  And by that, I mean, to the 

extent that the other side raises the concern 

that, you know, they're treating law as policy, 

isn't there a concern that policy questions 

might be treated as law and that what Chevron is 

doing is also helping the Court to police its 

own determinations in that regard? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think a 

way to illustrate this is to think about a 

delegation like the deceptive practices as 

defined by the Secretary.  If there were a 

statute that said that, of course, a court 

couldn't come in and say, well, the Secretary 

has said what's a deceptive practice, but I -- I 

think that actually there's a better way to 

think about the concept of what is deceptive

and, therefore, I'm going to override what the 

agency has done or not give any weight to it.

 Congress has directed there that what 

you should do as a court is pay attention to 

what the Secretary did because the Secretary was

 given that role in administration.  Obviously,

 Chevron applies to circumstances where that 

delegation is not quite as explicit, but it's

 meant to identify the same basic idea where I 

think the courts' role then is to give effect to 

what Congress has done. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why isn't the 

answer what -- what the other side says, which 

is, really, make Congress say that?  In other 

words, you know, it seems to me their argument 

is, when we're policing this line between what 

is law and what is policy, we should require 

Congress to say the Secretary gets to make this 

decision, and when it doesn't, then I guess we 

look at it as a legal question that the courts 

can decide. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that 

that argument would have more merit if there 

weren't so much water under the bridge and the 

fact that the Court explained when it would

And, you know, Petitioners talked about the 

reliance interests here and tried to diminish

 them. They didn't talk about Congress's own 

reliance interests in enacting statutes against

 the backdrop of Chevron. 

So I think, at this juncture, to say 

we're actually going to switch the default and 

make Congress say discretion is conferred would 

be really to run to the detriment of Congress's 

own reasonable expectations with respect to 

drafting. 

And I think it also doesn't account 

for the category of cases where the language 

that Congress is using is infused with 

discretion.  They agree to terms like 

"reasonable," "appropriate," "necessary."  Those 

are terms that require greater application to 

concrete factual settings to fill in the 

details, and you can't just interpret those 

terms in a vacuum.  So I don't understand how 

this idea of just making Congress say it could 

function in that kind of world. 

And then the final thing is Congress 

has said something very important here, which is

 regulations or adjudications that have the force 

of law. That is part of the statute as well.

 And I think --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And you think that

 that really carries a lot? I've heard you use 

that and focus on that many times when you're

 talking about a situation in which deference is

 or should be required. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Exactly.  So 

Congress, in each and every statute where this 

is going to be applicable, where Chevron 

deference will even be available, is going to 

have to have made that judgment in the statute 

to give the agency that responsibility and role 

in implementing the statute. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: And let me just ask 

you about whether or not -- going to the issue 

of ambiguity, which has come up many times, 

whether or not the court could clarify when 

there is a gap or ambiguity that allows for or 

requires the court to -- to -- to go to step 

two. And what I'm thinking about is what I 

mentioned previously with your friend on the 

other side, which is that some scholars have

 actually identified different kinds of

 ambiguity.

 So, in one scenario, we have a statute 

that uses a broad term, and that term 

encompasses a range of reasonable meanings.

 There are three or four different ways that

 could be reasonably -- you know, the meaning of 

"stationary source," for example.

 But then there's also the kind of 

ambiguity in which a statute can mean only one 

thing, either A or B, perhaps because of the way 

the -- the -- the language, you know, is put 

forward in the statute.  It's just unclear 

whether it means A or B. 

I take these scholars to mean that, 

really, in -- the former scenario is the one in 

which we have a situation, in -- you know, where 

Chevron deference would be required.  And could 

the Court say something like that? 

And let me just clarify.  I mean, 

Chevron, I -- I look at it as that's reducing to 

a policy choice, that once we are in the world 

of finding the kind of ambiguity where there are 

a number of reasonable alternatives in terms of 

making this determination, then, you know, it's

one, you know, Congress -- Congress wanted in 

some sense or which entity Congress wanted to

 make that decision.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I think

 that there -- certainly, this Court could 

provide more guidance to lower courts and, in 

particular, identify the types of statutory 

issues that might clearly connote discretion, 

there are going to be some easy calls on this, 

and the types of situations where there might be 

multiple, possible ways to implement and play 

that will signal that there really is a zone of 

discretion and the agency should have some 

flexibility. 

My only concern with going down the 

road of saying there's some fundamental 

difference with respect to particular terms that 

might be subject to only two possible ways to be 

implemented is that, you know, there are kind of 

an endless number of statutes out there and all 

kinds of varieties, and I worry that it might 

lose sight of certain contexts where Congress 

actually was comfortable with either way of 

implementing that particular term, even if there

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. MARTINEZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

Just a few points in rebuttal. 

First of all, I think it's really 

important to be very clear about what Chevron 

does. It takes the power to say that the law --

what the law means, to say that the law means X, 

and it takes that power away from courts and it 

gives it to agencies, and it then forces 

agencies -- forces courts to adjudicate the 

rights of individual litigants that are in front 

of them based on a version of the law that the 

courts themselves do not believe is correct, do 

not believe is the best interpretation.

Neither Congress nor this Court can 

create a doctrine or legislate a statute that --

that effectuates that reallocation of 

interpretive authority. My friend on the other 

side said that the purpose of Chevron is to set 

the ground rules on -- on how the -- the

 different branches of government should operate.

 With respect, I think the Constitution 

sets those ground rules, and the Constitution 

makes clear that the judicial power, the power 

to say what the law is, the power to interpret 

the law, rests with courts, not with agencies, 

and -- and certainly not with Congress either. 

And I think the APA reinforces that. 

The Solicitor General tries to -- to 

rescue or reconceptualize Chevron by I think 

taking issue with our argument that under 

Chevron, if the court thinks the best 

interpretation is X, it sometimes is going to 

have to apply Y because the agency told it to. 

I think, if you look at Footnote 11 of 

Chevron, that is exactly what Chevron itself 

says. It -- it tells the agency -- the court

words, an interpretation that the court itself 

does not think is best.

 The Solicitor General also describes 

Chevron as applying, and -- and the formulation 

that I heard a lot today is it applies if the

 agency didn't resolve the question, which is a 

kind of innocuous phrasing, but what is really

 meant by that is that Chevron applies in cases

 of ambiguity.  And ambiguity has always been 

understood as a situation where reasonable 

people can disagree about what the law means. 

And that just broadens the scope of 

deference.  Ambiguities are all over the place. 

Courts resolve ambiguities all the time.  That's 

core to the interpretive function.  And so 

there's no reason to think that just because 

Congress has accidentally left an ambiguity in a 

statute, that what it's really trying to do is 

have that ambiguity resolved by policy decisions 

made by an agency. 

Justice Barrett asked about the -- the 

justification for Chevron and whether the intent 

justification is really valid.  And I took my 

friend to -- to essentially concede that the 

delegation is fictional but nonetheless to say

that we should apply it anyway as a presumption.

 I -- I -- I don't think that you can 

get the mileage that you need to get out of the

 intentional delegation theory after you've 

conceded it's fictional because the only reason 

that intentional delegation theory has weight is 

if it's actually what Congress wanted to do, and 

if Congress didn't actually want to delegate it,

 then we shouldn't be, you know, basing our 

doctrine reconceptualizing how we think about 

statutory interpretation based on this fictional 

premise. 

Here, there's really no reason to 

think that Congress actually wanted to delegate 

policymaking authority to agencies to resolve 

ambiguity -- any ambiguity that arises in -- in 

any statute administered by the agency. 

I think the government's sort of 

solution to that problem is to propose a clear 

statement requirement on Congress.  Hey, you can 

just legislate more clearly.  But ambiguities 

are -- are -- are accidental; they're 

unintentional. And so I don't think that works. 

I think that would impose a massive clarity tax 

on Congress that's unjustified.

With respect to the history, Your 

Honor, I think the mandamus precedents make very

 clear themselves that they're talking about

 remedies, and those cases like Decatur and 

Dunlap expressly say that if we were

 interpreting these -- these legal issues in a 

different context, where we weren't limited by 

the limits on mandamus remedies, we would apply

 our -- our best and independent judgment. 

With respect to the APA, the Solicitor 

General is looking at text that -- that requires 

courts to interpret statutory provisions and --

and is saying that that rule, interpret 

statutory provisions, is consistent with 

Chevron, which she describes in her brief as 

allocating interpretive authority to agencies. 

So the statute says courts do the 

interpretation.  Chevron says agencies get 

interpretive authority, not courts.  These are 

inconsistent.  Chevron's not consistent with the 

APA. 

Finally, with respect to the -- the 

course correction idea or the amend it, don't 

end it approach, I would just respectfully 

suggest that you've tried to amend this.  You've

 tried to course correct over and over again over

 the years.  That's why we have a Chevron

 doctrine.  It's overladen with a lot of bells

 and whistles.  It's very hard to apply in

 practice.

 I think, in -- in -- in the real 

world, if you try to amend it without ending it,

 what's going to happen is you're going to put a 

lot of pressure on the Major Questions Doctrine. 

People are going to be coming to this Court 

every three or four years asking you to adopt a 

new limitation, a new caveat, a new threshold 

test. 

We would respectfully suggest that the 

solution here is to recognize that the 

fundamental problem is Chevron itself. 

Interpretive authority belongs to the courts. 

If we have the best view of the 

statute, we should win this case.  Thank you, 

Your Honors. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted.
