 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-529, Cantero versus

 Bank of America.

 Mr. Taylor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN E. TAYLOR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. TAYLOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Section 25b preempts a state consumer 

financial law only if, as relevant here, "it 

prevents or significantly interferes with" the 

exercise of a national bank's powers.  Bank of 

America argues and the Second Circuit held that 

this statute preempts any law that controls or 

otherwise hinders the exercise of a national 

bank's powers, regardless of whether the law has 

any significant effect on such powers. 

This test conflicts with the statute 

for four reasons.  First, Section 25b's 

definition of "state consumer financial law" is 

incompatible with the control test because it 

would require that every such law be preempted, 

nullifying the statute and erecting the very

 field preemption regime that the statute

 forbids.  Bank of America's only retort is to 

concede that state fair lending laws aren't 

categorically preempted, a concession it doesn't 

explain and that disproves its own test.

 Second, the control test ignores

 Section 25b's express codification of Barnett 

Bank's "prevents or significantly interferes

 with" standard and, in particular, the word 

"significantly," which Bank of America reads out 

of the statute. 

Third, a control test can't be squared 

with Section 25b's provisions for OCC preemption 

determinations, which must assess the impact of 

a state law and be based on substantial 

evidence.  These requirements would make no 

sense if a control test were the law. 

Finally and perhaps most 

fundamentally, adopting a control test would 

require reading virtually all of Section 25b to 

have no real-world effect. 

With no plausible textual argument, 

Bank of America turns to policy, claiming that 

its test is needed to avoid mayhem.  But 

Congress disagreed, and Section 25b has a

solution to this concern. The OCC can make the

 preemption determinations contemplated by the 

statute. That it has thus far failed to respect

 the statute's commands grants no license to this

 Court to do the same.

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: I'd be interested in

 you -- on -- on giving us your explanation as to 

how Barnett Bank gives us guidance as to how to 

interpret "prevents or significantly 

interferes." 

MR. TAYLOR: Sure, Justice Thomas.  So 

Barnett Bank uses the -- the -- the -- "prevents 

or significantly interferes with" standard as a 

kind of distillation of the rule that emerges 

from this Court's cases. 

Now, of course, the conflict that was 

at issue in Barnett Bank was a stark conflict. 

It involved a state statute that said banks may 

not do X and a federal statute that said 

national banks may do X, and this Court was able 

to resolve that as a clear conflict. 

But it didn't give much guidance 

itself in terms of what "significant interferes 

with" means, but it did articulate that as the

 standard that emerges from this Court's cases. 

And the first case that it cited was this

 Court's decision in Anderson.  And Anderson 

involved a Kentucky escheat law, and the Court

 in that case -- there was a preemption challenge 

that was brought to that statute by the national

 bank, and the Court in that case said that's not 

a discriminatory statute. It was the first 

question the Court asked. It doesn't conflict 

with any statutory text, and so we examine the 

law's practical effect. 

And in examining the law's practical 

effect, it distinguished a prior decision from 

this Court that reached the opposite outcome. 

And the only way to explain that pair of cases 

is that -- is that the Court examined the 

practical effect. 

And so I think the one thing that we 

know of the "prevents or significantly 

interferes with" standard and what it means is 

that it requires an examination at a minimum of 

the -- the practical effect of the statute. And 

that's clear from the ordinary meaning of the 

phrase, and it's confirmed by the surrounding 

text in Section 25b, including the provision

that requires that the OCC examine the law's

 impact based on substantial evidence --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what does it --

MR. TAYLOR: -- and periodically

 review. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and what is it 

-- what exactly does it mean to examine the

 practical effect?  I mean, why -- why don't you 

talk about this law and say how an analysis of 

that kind would work with respect to this law 

and then maybe say anything more general you 

want, because it seems to provide no guidance at 

all to courts as to what they have to do. 

MR. TAYLOR: Yeah, I -- I will answer 

that question directly, but I will say that 

because of the way that Bank of America has 

argued the case and the way that the Second 

Circuit decided the case, the only question that 

this Court has to confront is whether the 

control test is codified as part of Section 25b 

or whether, instead, courts must look to the 

practical effect of the law. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I appreciate 

that, but one thing that we should think about 

at least in considering whether the practical

 that's codified and is the appropriate one --

MR. TAYLOR: Mm-hmm.  Sure.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is what -- what

 would that -- what would that mean?  What would 

it look like? And then we can, you know, 

consider whether that's what Congress had in

 mind.

 MR. TAYLOR: Yeah.  So it might look 

like the -- the -- the showing that the national 

bank made in Franklin National Bank, for 

example, and I would recommend that you look at 

the trial court decision in that case. 

So that case involved a federal 

statute that granted to national banks the 

authority to accept savings deposits.  And New 

York had a statute that didn't prohibit national 

banks from accepting savings but -- deposits but 

disabled them from using the word "savings" in 

their business operation and in their 

advertisements or any equivalent thereof and 

reserved to the -- to certain state institutions 

the privilege to use that word. 

And what the national bank said in 

that case, it identified real-world evidence

 served as an obstacle to it attempting to accept 

savings deposits in its business operations, and

 the -- and the trial court in that case found 

what is effectively significant interference.

 And by the time that case got to this 

Court, this Court, although it resolved its --

you know, the -- the question before it based on

 statutory construction grounds, emphasizing the 

statute, the federal statute's use of the word 

"savings," I think it had confidence based on 

the record before it that that the -- that word 

mattered in the real world. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if it's -- if that 

-- if that standard had been used here, what 

would that have meant?  What evidence would the 

parties have put on, and how would the court 

have addressed the issue? 

MR. TAYLOR: So the legal question 

would be whether there's significant 

interference.  And we think that looks to the 

practical effect, and Bank of America would have 

to identify what the practical effect is. 

I think it would be particularly easy 

for it to do so here because we have a statute

that's been on the books for 50 years. State

 banks have been complying with it.  Most federal 

banks, it's my understanding, have been

 complying with it.  And, indeed, there was a

 preemption challenge that was immediately 

brought, and it failed, and, presumably, 

national banks were complying with it after

 that. And so they could look at the data

 showing the extent to which this minimum 

interest requirement has caused banks to not 

offer mortgage escrow services to -- which would 

be the relevant power, to consumers.

bright-line test.

including, you know, field preemption.  That's

want that.  And on the other hand, the

 Department of the Treasury submitted a proposal 

that would have made preemption determinations

 turn entirely on whether the law is

 discriminatory.  That's also administrable, but 

in the judgment of Congress, that didn't go far 

enough to provide protection to the bank --

banks, and Congress wanted to -- to give banks, 

as an accommodation, the opportunity in a 

case-by-case basis to show that there's a 

significant interference. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What about --

MR. TAYLOR: And that's the scheme 

that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can I just ask 

about Franklin?  Because I think Franklin's a 

critical case here because it's identified in 

Barnett, identified in Watters, so -- and in 

figuring out, as Justice Kagan and Justice 

Thomas says, what "significantly interferes" 

means, I think one way to do is look at -- look 

at the precedent applying it.  So Barnett, if 

you look at that first, but Barnett really rests 

heavily on Franklin.  We know Franklin is 

correctly decided --

 statute.  You agree with that?

 MR. TAYLOR: Agree with that entirely.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So then the

 question, I think one way to look at it -- you 

tell me why this is wrong -- is, does this kind

 of state law at issue here significantly 

interfere more than the law did in Franklin? 

Is that a good way to look at it? 

MR. TAYLOR: You could put it that 

way, yes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And doesn't 

a law that interferes with the pricing of the 

product almost by definition interfere more with 

the operations of the bank than something that 

affects advertising?

isn't whether it would cost money to the bank to 

comply with the statute.  The -- the question,

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why not? That 

sounds like significant interference when

 it's -- when it's affecting how much -- it's 

almost putting a tax on the bank to sell the 

product, which strikes me as a much more 

significant interference than simply saying you

 can't use the word "savings" in your 

advertising, which was the issue in Franklin.

 MR. TAYLOR: Well, if -- if -- if the 

test for preemption turned entirely on 

compliance costs, then a whole bunch of 

generally applicable laws that my friend on the 

other side concedes are not preempted would 

nevertheless be preempted if it cost money to 

the bank to comply with those.  So I don't think 

compliance costs alone are enough. 

I think what you need instead is what 

this Court said in Barnett Bank, which is it's 

not enough that there just be significant 

interference with, you know, profits.  The --

the question is whether there's a significant 

interference with a power that Congress 

explicitly granted.  And so the focus is on --

is on what Congress --

the trial court's decision there because I think 

it's illuminating for -- for this question.

understand coming on the heels of Anderson that 

there was going to be some kind of a practical 

showing.  And this Court noted the large record 

showing the real-world consequences of the law

true that the New York Court of Appeals, when it

 upheld the law, said that it had no "seriously

 harmful effects on national banks"?

 MR. TAYLOR: That -- that may have --

be -- have been what it said, but if you look at

 the trial court's finding in the case, the --

the trial court found that based on the evidence 

that I was discussing with Justice Kavanaugh, 

the law "certainly restricts [national banks] 

tremendously in obtaining savings deposits." 

And that's effectively a finding of significant 

interference. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, that -- the 

law said they couldn't use savings in their 

advertising, but they could use a comparable 

phrase like special interest account. 

MR. TAYLOR: And -- and --

interference that's greater than the 

interference there is -- is enough, that

MR. TAYLOR: Two responses, Justice

 Alito. I -- the -- if you look at the testimony

 in that -- in that case, it was clear that

 consumers had no idea what "interest-bearing

 account" meant.  I mean, there were -- the word 

"savings" actually mattered to their purchasing 

decisions, and it had a real-world effect, and 

that was a law that was discriminatory and put 

the national banks at a serious competitive 

advantage -- disadvantage vis-à-vis state banks. 

And, of course, under this statute, a 

discriminatory law would be preempted for 

another -- for -- independent reasons. 

And so the way that this statute is 

designed is that non-discrimination is the most 

important principle that runs through the 

statute.  And if a law is non-discriminatory, 

then I think we can assume that the hostility 

that states have traditionally shown to national 

banks are -- are not going to be reflected in 

their laws because we're only going to be 

talking about laws that involve restrictions 

that states are willing to impose on their own 

banks and they're not going to devour their own, 

and so --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you -- do you think 

that the significant interference test should be 

applied on a bank-by-bank basis or on an

 industry basis?

 MR. TAYLOR: No, it's not bank by

 bank. That's not how it works in our view.  If 

you look at the statute, it's clear that when 

the OCC makes preemption determinations, it --

it does so on a law-by-law basis, not a 

bank-by-bank -- basis. 

And even there, in consultation with 

the CFPB, it can make preemption determinations 

that go beyond that law and reach substantively 

equivalent laws.  And so --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that a -- is that a 

question of -- a pure question of law? Is it a 

mixed question?  Is it a question of fact? 

MR. TAYLOR: The ultimate preemption 

determination --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, the question of 

whether it significantly interferes.  Is that a 

question of fact? 

MR. TAYLOR: It's a legal question for 

a court, but it -- because that -- it takes

have to know what those effects are. And it's 

going to be, if the OCC hasn't identified the 

effects, then it's going to be incumbent on the 

bank, if there's no statute on point and we're

 talking about a non-discriminatory law, to 

explain what those effects are.

 And then the fight is not going to be

 about necessarily the effects of the law but 

about whether that rises to the level of 

significant interference --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, but the burden 

would --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the burden would be

MR. TAYLOR: Well, this is -- I mean, 

if the plaintiff is a national bank challenging 

the law, then yes, the burden would be on the 

national bank.  Conversely, if the -- if, as in 

this case, the preemption is raised as an 

affirmative defense, then the burden would still 

be on the national bank.

say, in the Southern District of New York, 

Eastern District of New York, wherever, is going

 to have a trial to determine the effect of this

 on all national banks operating in New York.

 And is that going to involve extensive

 discovery?  Would it involve testimony by

 experts?  If the court makes a decision, it --

what standard of review is going to be applied 

by the Second Circuit? 

MR. TAYLOR: So we don't think that

just say as a predicate to my response, Justice 

Alito, I think it's fairly unlikely that a lot

I was talking about.

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's a factual 

question or at least it's a heavily factual

 question.  How is it going to be decided without

 evidence?

 MR. TAYLOR: Well, you'd have to know 

what the effects are, so that would require

 some, I mean, evidence in the typical case. 

But, if it's clear from the face of the statute, 

if it's just obviously punitive and it -- it's 

past the point of reasonable people being able 

to disagree as to whether there's significant 

interference, and -- then I think that could be 

decided as a matter of economic logic, which is 

consistent with what this Court has done in

logic?

if you look at page 15 of our reply brief, we

 identify some cases involving preemption regimes 

that affect entire industries, airline industry, 

a motor carry industry, you know, ERISA, you

 name it, prescription drugs, and it is often the

 case in -- in -- in, you know, those -- those

 contexts that there is a -- a -- a -- a -- a --

a factual showing that needs to be made. And

 sometimes this Court, included in the Morales 

decision, for example, has resolved the 

preemption question even though it turns on 

significant effect based on economic logic. 

Now I think it would be difficult to 

do that for the ordinary case because we can 

presume that states aren't going to inflict 

obviously -- you know, punitive restrictions on 

their own banks.  And so -- and this law would 

be an -- an example of that.

enough to do that --

-- this --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And Franklin, I 

think, is kind of our North Star here at least 

as I've unpacked the case.

 MR. TAYLOR: Right.  But -- but -- but 

I think Franklin, you could either read it as 

being a case about significant interference 

based on the record, as I pointed out, or I 

think what this Court said is it just engaged in 

statutory interpretation. 

It said we've got a federal statute 

that says national banks may accept savings 

deposits and the word "savings" matters.  It's 

the label that Congress used for these accounts. 

And states can't pose a serious practical 

impediment to that by saying you can't use that 

same label. 

And so that case could be understood 

on statutory construction grounds based on the 

express statutory power that was granted by the 

statute, and we have nothing like that here.

 said that the -- that the bank has, the national 

bank has a certain power, and the state 

conditions the exercise of that national power

I misunderstood you because it's important to my

 thinking about this -- that the issue -- that 

Franklin Bank can be understood as deciding this

 issue without examining the empirical question 

of the extent to which there was an impact on

 the operation of the bank.  I thought that's

 what you said.

 MR. TAYLOR: I guess I would put it a

 little -- little bit differently then, Justice 

Alito. I think that the Court, in its opinion, 

it notes the -- the -- the record that had been 

amassed on this question as to the practical 

consequences of the law, and I think that record 

gave it some comfort and confirmed why it was 

significant that Congress would have used the 

statutory term "savings." 

But, ultimately, its opinion rests on, 

you know, statutory analysis of the word 

"savings" and a specific statutory 

interpretation that is -- would present a sort 

of -- I mean, you could think of it as being a 

conflict in that -- in that sense and is nothing 

like the kind of conflict that we have here. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Thank you. 

MR. TAYLOR: Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government

 asked us to vacate and remand and let the Second

 Circuit apply whatever we say is the correct

 test.

 MR. TAYLOR: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're asking us 

to reverse. 

What's the difference, and why don't 

we do what the -- the U.S. is recommending? 

MR. TAYLOR: We would be happy with a 

vacatur, and I think it's the most modest way 

for this Court to decide the -- the question 

before it. The reason why we're asking for 

reversal is we think that as long as there's a 

requirement that the practical effect of the law 

be examined, that Bank of America has failed to 

make that showing, and since it's failed to make 

that showing, then it -- its motion to dismiss 

should be denied, and it can make the showing at 

a later stage of the litigation or put in some 

declarations or something and seek summary 

judgment if it thinks it can meet --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- I mean

 MR. TAYLOR: I -- but I don't think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the statute

 doesn't speak in terms of practical effects.  It

 talks about preventing or significantly 

interfering with the exercise of a national bank 

power. So I do think that there is a difference 

between practical effect and that language. 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, I think that 

language, in ordinarily -- parlance, could only 

be understood to -- to say that to be able to 

answer that question, you've got to know what 

the practical effect of the law is. 

And you don't have to necessarily know 

what the degree is.  I mean, that -- you know, 

people can disagree about that, but, at a 

minimum, you've got to -- it -- it's got to take 

some account of what the practical effect is.

what the OCC has said about the effect of this

 law. And you'll find that there's not much

 there in -- in either the 2011 rulemaking or the

 2004 rulemaking or in the amicus brief that the

 OCC submitted below.  But we think a -- you 

know, it would be appropriate for a court to

 consider that as part of the analysis.

 But I -- I would also just -- I -- I 

-- I appreciate the -- the other side's concern 

about the practical consequences of, you -- you 

know, reading the statute for what -- for what 

it says.  And I would just say a couple of 

things.  One is that I -- I think you could in 

your opinion, you know, remind lower courts that 

this is not the only path to preemption. 

There's the requirement of -- that the law be 

non-discriminatory, and there's still, you know, 

the requirement that it not pose a square 

conflict of the sort that was at -- at issue in 

Barnett Bank, which, you know, covers 

"prevents." 

And so then you've got the question of 

significant interference.  You could, you know, 

point to Anderson and Franklin, as we have been

 discussing, but the OCC has a role to play there

 too. And the OCC does have expertise, and to

 the extent that it thinks a particular state law

 is -- is very troubling and poses a significant

 interference, it can endeavor to explain why in

 a rulemaking, consistent with the statute, and 

courts can look at that, and to the extent that

 it's persuasive, they can defer to it. And that

 gives the -- you know, banks the kind of, you

 MR. TAYLOR: I don't know that I can

 answer that question in the abstract. But, I

 mean, I -- well, I guess I can. Barnett Bank

 would be -- would be an example. So even if

 that's non-discriminatory, it poses a -- a clear

 conflict because of the total --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So you've 

separated that out as a case that poses a -- a 

clear conflict. 

MR. TAYLOR: Correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is the category 

of that case? Are there cases that fall in 

other categories that might pass the significant 

interference test?  I guess what I'm -- I'm --

I'm asking about is, you know, you say of Bank 

of America's test that it would preempt 

everything, but one could say about your test 

that it would preempt basically nothing as long 

as a statute was indeed non-discriminatory. 

MR. TAYLOR: No.  And -- and, indeed, 

that was the Treasury Department's proposal, 

that it -- that it would -- that preemption 

would just turn on whether a state law was

 discriminatory, and if it wasn't discriminatory, 

then it wouldn't be preempted.

 And we know Congress didn't select

 that regime.  So it's got to do some work beyond

 non-discrimination. I just bring that up to

 point out that we know that ease of

 administration wasn't top of mind for Congress.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So what's the

 work? Give -- give me some --

MR. TAYLOR: Yeah.  And so --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- statutes. 

MR. TAYLOR: So -- so the statute says 

"prevents or significantly interferes with."  We 

think the word "prevents" is how you take care 

of a case like Barnett Bank.  It just -- it's a 

square conflict.  It prevents the exercise of 

the power granted by Congress.  That can be 

resolved just with legal briefing. 

Then -- but, if you're at the point of 

-- substantial -- or significant interference, 

rather, that's a question of degree, and it's 

very difficult to answer that on the abstract.

 It's a question of degree.  And I --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You -- you might --

must know a lot about state banking statutes. 

Is there any state banking statute out there 

that you think presents a hard question?

 MR. TAYLOR: I -- I don't -- nothing

 comes immediately to mind.  And -- but I -- I 

think, you know, you could imagine if a state 

were to say you can't have mortgage escrow 

accounts.  Well, of course, that would -- as 

applied to, you know, the covered accounts, they 

would -- it would pose a square conflict with 

the federal statute.  But, if you totally 

disabled states -- national banks from being 

able to exercise a particular power, that -- you 

know, that that's a "prevents" case. 

But the question of significant 

interference is necessarily one of degree, and 

it's tough to know in the abstract exactly when 

it would be satisfied.  I need to know what --

what the actual on-the-ground impact is and the

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think you said

Would a 10 percent state law, would that be 

significant interference? 

MR. TAYLOR: So, if it's 

non-discriminatory -- I'm assuming for purposes 

of the hypothetical it would be 

non-discriminatory, although I think requiring 

that it be non-discriminatory makes it 

particularly unlikely that a state would ever do 

something like that.

 MR. TAYLOR: Well, the -- the question

 of -- of -- as to what "significant 

interference" means is ultimately a legal

 question, and it turns on what the actual

 practical on-the-ground impact is. And if the 

bank in that scenario said, look --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If it's a judgment 

call, who's the -- we're making the judgment 

call or the court of appeals? 

MR. TAYLOR: It ultimately would be a 

legal question. And, Justice Alito, you asked 

earlier about the standard of review.  That 

would be de novo. I mean, to the extent that it 

rested on factual findings, you know, that would 

be a different standard.  But the ultimate legal 

question of significant interference is for a 

court and ultimately, you know, subject to 

review by this Court.

 advertising and how you describe your product. 

That is significant interference. And you agree

 that that's correct?

 MR. TAYLOR: I -- I think that's a way 

to understand that case. And so, if you wanted 

to give guidance to lower courts, you could use 

Franklin National Bank as an example, just as 

the Barnett Bank Court did in its -- in its 

opinion. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And I guess, 

here -- I mean, this -- maybe this is for remand

describe your product in your advertising, but 

you actually have to pay money that you wouldn't

That's just common sense, isn't it?

 MR. TAYLOR: Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  To tell -- tell 

someone you have to pay out large sums of money

 collectively, rather than how you describe your

 product in your advertising, isn't one more 

significant interference than the other, the 

price of --

MR. TAYLOR: No.  So I'll take Frank 

-- the Franklin side of that question first if I 

may. So just to be clear about the law in 

Franklin, it went well beyond advertising and it 

-- it disabled banks from even being able to use 

the word "savings" in their -- on their deposit 

slips, anywhere in their bank offices.  It, you 

know, it just eradicated the word or any of its 

equivalents from the -- the premises of the 

bank. 

And I think, you know, what made --

you could -- might think about that as posing a 

First Amendment problem today.  It was also a 

discriminatory law that gave certain state

 so it posed a number of distinct problems, but I

 think ultimately too it posed a -- a -- a

 conflict with the text of the federal statute

 because the -- you know, the state in that 

scenario thought to significantly interfere with 

the exercise and express statutory power that

 Congress granted.  So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The advertising 

was not an express power.  The advertising the 

Court made clear was an incidental power. 

MR. TAYLOR: Right, but the -- the --

the power that I think ultimately the Court 

focused on was the express power to accept 

savings deposits, and in particular, the use of 

the word "savings," I think, was critical to the 

Court's analysis. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  And, here, 

the express power is the lending and the 

incidental power is the escrow accounts, 

correct? 

MR. TAYLOR: The way the Bank of 

America articulates the power, we're not 

disputing their articulation of the power for 

purposes of, you know, this Court's decision, is

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mm-hmm.

 MR. TAYLOR: So the question is to --

the extent to which the law significantly

 interferes with that power.

           JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And do you still

 think McCulloch versus Maryland was correctly

MR. TAYLOR: Yes.  We're -- we have no

answer that question.

why is that correctly decided and this 

different? 

MR. TAYLOR: So we -- we point to this 

in our brief, but there are a couple of key 

distinctions. 

So that case involved a tax, a 

discriminatory tax on the Second Bank of the 

United States.  And I think, at that time, the 

Second Bank of the United States functioned more 

like the Federal Reserve Bank, and it was -- it 

had a really -- it had a public-facing 

component.  And it doesn't -- you know, modern

 And the laws that we have as in -- in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, you're 

drawing a distinction which I also saw, excuse 

me, in your brief between express powers and 

incidental powers.  Can you just explain to me 

why that matters?  And -- and I'll -- I'll tell 

you kind of where I'm going with it or why I'm 

-- I'm thinking about it. 

It almost sounds to me -- and -- and 

correct me if I'm wrong -- that you're saying 

that if a power is express, that something more 

like a control test might apply just as a matter 

of economic logic, say, but that if it's

more fact-specific inquiry.

 Am I understanding your position?

 MR. TAYLOR: I -- I think you're right 

to point out that we do underscore the fact that 

this is an incidental power so that Congress

 hasn't said anything specific on this subject.

 And, indeed, it's a kind of second 

order incidental power that is at issue, which 

is not just the ability to have the accounts but 

then, you know, to set the interest rate. 

And so I think the reason why we're 

focusing on that is preemption questions 

typically turn on what Congress says in the text 

of the statute, and so you want to look at the 

text of the statute. 

And this Court in Barnett Bank, right 

before the sentence that articulates the 

standard as "prevents or significantly 

interferes with," says that the relevant power 

is the power that "Congress explicitly granted." 

Now what's interesting here is the 

National Bank Act actually expressly grants 

incidental -- incidental powers. And so there 

is an express grant of authority for -- to 

national banks to engage in incidental powers,

but the ultimate question I -- I think -- has to

 focus on what Congress has -- has said in the

 text of a statute.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I mean, I -- I 

do agree with that, but you've characterized 

Barnett Bank a couple times as kind of an 

express conflict, but Barnett Bank goes out of 

its way to say we don't have an irreconcilable

 conflict there.  It wasn't that the -- it wasn't 

the kind of situation where you had the federal 

statute saying, you know, do X and the state 

statute saying not X. 

And so it was about significant --

interference.  And I don't read Barnett Bank to 

be applying this kind of fact-specific inquiry 

that you're talking about. 

So is the difference really just that 

the statute said something express? 

MR. TAYLOR: Well, so in Barnett Bank, 

you're right that there was an impossibility 

preemption.  So it wasn't impossible for the 

bank to both comply with the federal statute and 

the state statute.  But the Court did say that 

there was an express conflict based on the text 

of the statute.

And so it really -- the irony is 

Barnett Bank announced the standard which it 

distilled from this Court's cases, but it really 

didn't have occasion to flesh out the contours 

of what "significant interference" means because

 it involved a complete prohibition.

 And so the -- but the Court left no 

indication in its opinion that if the law at 

issue in that case were less than a complete 

prohibition, that it would automatically be 

preempted under the control test. 

To the contrary, even the bank in --

in Barnett Bank at oral argument conceded that a 

whole bunch of state regulations would be 

appropriate as to the regulation of insurance, 

including ensuring that agents of insurance are 

licensed at the state level. 

And so I think -- I don't read this 

Court's opinion to -- to suggest that practical 

effects aren't -- aren't -- relevant.  To the 

contrary, I think, by using significant 

interference, the Court understood that 

practical effect -- effects would matter, and 

what it was trying to capture is laws that even 

if they didn't completely prohibit the exercise

something that would raise the same kind of

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I see the -- the

So can you help me to sort of 

contemplate how if at all this "significantly 

interferes" standard is any different from, you 

know, similar standards in other statutes? 

So last term, in Roth, we looked at a 

statute that asks whether religious 

accommodation would impose a "undue hardship" on 

the conduct of the employer's business.  RFRA 

imposes a "substantial burden test."  So isn't 

this sort of in the nature of statutory 

standards of this kind and the Court looks at

them and we make a decision, right?

 MR. TAYLOR: Absolutely, Justice

 Jackson, that's -- that's correct.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And 

then, with respect to the arduous nature of this 

and sort of, you know, what has to be proven, I

 guess I'm wondering, doesn't what is necessary 

to be established to meet this standard depend 

on the reason that the bank says the statutory 

standard is being met in a particular case? 

So, you know, the bank says we are 

pointing to this preemption provision and we say 

that it's -- that -- that what is going on here 

with this state law significantly interferes 

with our powers, and then I guess they go on to 

say how, how is that happening. 

So, when they say this significantly 

interferes with my powers because it directly 

conflicts with what the statute says about our 

authority, which is what I understood was 

happening in, you know, Barnett Bank and 

Franklin, then I guess the Court doesn't have to 

have a bunch of depositions or anything. 

They're doing sort of a statutory analysis. 

Is that right?

 with my power because it imposes an undue

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

   SUPPORTING VACATUR

 MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 I'd like to make three quick points

 before taking questions. 

The first is that the Court shouldn't 

assume that the word "significantly" either in 

the opinion of the Court in Barnett Bank or in 

the statute itself is devoid of significance. 

If Congress wanted a statute that said state law 

is preempted when it forces the bank to deviate 

in any way from what it would otherwise do, it 

wouldn't have used the word "significantly," it 

would have used another formulation. 

Second, in Franklin National Bank, the 

Court didn't suggest that all state law 

restrictions on national bank advertising were 

preempted.  It emphasized that the word 

"savings" was the very word that Congress had 

used in the statutes to describe the product at 

issue and that it was the very word that in 

consumers' minds was most closely linked to the 

product.

And as Mr. Taylor explained at trial, 

the bank in that case presented extensive

 evidence that its -- would be hindered in its 

ability to obtain savings accounts if it 

couldn't use that word. 

And, last, I'd say, the Court should 

look not only at Franklin, the case the Court

 cited in Barnett Bank as an example of a 

preemptive statute, but also at Anderson 

National Bank, and Anderson National Bank 

involved a state-abandoned deposit law. It 

authorized the state to take over the deposit, 

force the bank to turn over a deposit from -- to 

the state upon proof that the account had been 

inactive for a specified period of time. 

And it's hard to imagine a more direct 

interference with the bank's ability to do 

business than telling the bank you would prefer 

to hold the money and earn income on it, but we 

require you to turn it over to us. But the 

Court explained for various reasons that this 

was not -- would -- would not substantially 

interfere with the -- the way the bank did

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Stewart, the --

is there a difference in the treatment of 

incidental powers versus the express power you

 mentioned in Franklin?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I don't think

 generally.  I mean, in -- incidental powers are 

powers, as you know, that are not enumerated in 

the statute, and interference with a -- an 

incidental power can cause indirect harm to the 

bank's ability to exercise the -- the -- the 

express power. 

I would point out that the Court in 

Barnett Bank, in the sentence immediately 

preceding the one that we've been focused on, 

said the prior cases, the ones that have found 

preemption, take the view that normally Congress 

would not want to -- states to forbid or to 

impair significantly the exercise of a power 

that Congress explicitly granted. 

So it was focusing on express powers 

there, and it was saying, even with respect to 

express powers, the interference has to be --

the impairment has to be significant.  The 

control test doesn't apply to express powers. 

So I don't think there's a meaningful

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do 

you agree with your friend that the determining

 whether something is significant is -- would be

 something you can do without trial evidence?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, certainly, if 

the OCC were doing it, it would have kind of a 

preexisting body of information about the way 

the national banks operate, and it might be able 

to draw on that font of experience in 

determining whether restrictions that might seem 

innocuous to a layperson could, in fact, 

predictably have a significant adverse effect on 

the bank's business. 

I think Mr. Taylor was also alluding 

to the Court's decision in Morales, which 

involved the Airline Deregulation Act, in which 

the Court explained how the -- the state false 

advertising law would impair the airlines' 

ability to engage in the pricing practices that 

they wanted to engage in.  And the Court didn't 

make quite clear exactly where the information 

about the pricing practices came from, but it 

didn't appear to come from a trial record. 

So there may be kind of sources of

the OCC do here. And you alluded to that. 

It's interesting, I -- I -- I'm not 

sure what to make of this, but in the 13 years 

or so since Dodd-Frank, we don't have an OCCA 

rule on escrow accounts, except for the one 

issued in 2011 immediately after Dodd-Frank in 

which it reaffirmed its rule banning, as I 

understand it, any regulation by states on 

escrow accounts under an "obstruct or impair" 

standard that predated Dodd-Frank, it purported 

to ratify what it had done before under the old 

law. 

And -- and as I took it from a couple 

of cryptic footnotes in your brief, you're not 

asking us to defer to that regulation.  In fact, 

you're asking -- you -- you seem to suggest that

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And now you're 

saying, nah, that's not right.

 And is the OCC going to actually do 

some of this work at some point under the law?

 MR. STEWART: Well, as -- as far as 

I'm aware, the OCC has never issued a

 case-by-case preemption determination.  And --

and I don't know what the reason is, but I would 

say, if you imagine the OCC trying to do a 

case-by-case preemption determination with 

respect to the New York law at issue here, the 

most straightforward way to do it would simply 

be to say we have a regulation that says states 

can't regulate mortgage escrow accounts, this is 

a regulation of mortgage escrow accounts; 

therefore, it's preempted. 

But, if the OCC tried to do it that 

way, it would run into the provisions of 

Dodd-Frank that say, when the OCC does these 

determinations, it considers the impact of the 

state law --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In fact, we have 

exactly the regulation.  You say if they did 

this. They did it.  They said there are no 

escrow regulations that are permissible under

 not defending that regulation; you're disavowing

 directs it to do?

Petitioners' position in this case prevails and 

if the Court holds that some inquiry into 

practical impacts is necessary with respect to 

the individual state law, then it's very 

possible that the OCC will start making these 

case-by-case determinations because, independent 

of legal expertise, the OCC has expertise in the 

way that national banks operate and can bring 

that expertise to bear in determining whether --

Keep going with why you changed positions.  So

 one is you -- your reading of the text and

 history.

 MR. STEWART: That -- that -- that

 they indicate that Congress wanted the OCC to

 redo this.

 I think the second thing that we would 

say is the way in which OCC's view is currently

 manifested is in the 2011 regulations, but 

Congress said the way that OCC is supposed to do 

preemption determinations going forward is 

through case-by-case determinations.  And, 

historically, it's been a -- a requirement for 

deference that the agency act through the 

procedural mechanism that Congress specified. 

The third thing is Congress said, even 

when the OCC does case-by-case determinations, 

it only gets -- Skidmore deference.  It doesn't 

use the word "Skidmore," but it basically tracks 

language from Skidmore, and then it says nothing 

in the preceding subparagraph alters the 

deference that OCC gets for any other type of 

determination.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. --

MR. STEWART: Yes?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Stewart, do you 

have a view on whether this New York statute

 constitutes a significant interference with 

national banking powers?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I -- we -- we don't 

have a concluded view. Certainly, as Mr. Taylor 

points out, this is something that state banks 

have been complying with, apparently, without 

material impairment. 

I think it would depend in part on 

evidence or a factual showing about what rate of 

interest can the banks use on the money in the 

escrow account because --

that -- may I? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 Justice Thomas, anything further?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose the OCC 

doesn't act and suppose a bank says that

 requiring us to pay 2 percent interest or 

whatever rate of interest is involved in the

 particular case costs us this amount of money, 

and if we have to pay this additional amount of 

money in interest, then we're not going to be 

able to -- we're not going to continue to do 

this or that. 

How does it -- how would a court 

determine whether that is significant? 

MR. STEWART: I mean, I think it -- I 

-- I would kind of harken back to the point that 

Justice Jackson was making that -- there are 

many standards in the law that require this sort 

-- and they're -- they're imprecise, but I think 

the Court would ask how significant is the other 

thing that the bank says it wouldn't be able to 

do.

sufficient that a state law would require the 

bank to spend some amount of money on something.

I'd appreciate it if you would talk about the

There's the imprecision of the significant 

interference standard.  It does seem to have a 

very strong factual component.

how an empirical question like that can be 

decided without evidence, which would require

call on a lot of economic expertise and

 knowledge of the banking industry.  Every

 district judge in the country is potentially

 going to have to make the same kind of

 determination.

 And then there's the -- then there's 

the problem that these cases are going to be

 decided on an individual record. So suppose

 these Petitioners lose on this record.  Would 

that ban others who -- who have 

non-interest-bearing accounts with the Bank of 

America from being -- bringing suit and saying 

we can compile a better record, and then you 

have questions about the same decision -- the 

same issue being decided in different circuits? 

What if other states have -- require 

2 percent interest and the Second Circuit says 

one thing and the Fifth Circuit or the Tenth 

Circuit or whatever says something else?  And 

then you have issues of collateral estoppel. 

It just seems like a complicated 

situation, but you are able to assess the whole 

thing, so just explain why this would not cause 

practical nightmares.

two reasons. The first is that administration 

of standards like this is routine in the law, 

and the banks obviously have access to a lot of 

information that I don't have access to about 

the ways in which particular state laws would

 affect their operations.  The Flagstar amicus 

brief has a fairly intricate argument about how

 these sorts of laws would impair its ability to 

securitize loans and so forth. 

The -- but the second thing I would 

say, and Mr. Taylor alluded to this, is we also 

have non-discrimination as a backstop, and that 

gets rid of the horribles.  That gets rid of the 

extreme cases. 

In some instances, taxation, for 

instance, under current federal law, states can 

tax national banks so long as they do it on a 

non-discriminatory basis. The Court in Barnett 

Bank pointed out that national banks can operate 

branches only to the extent that it's 

permissible for state banks --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. Yeah, no, I --

I understand that.  But all you've said about 

the question -- put non-discrimination off the 

table because that's not what's at issue.  All

 different.

 understand my colleagues' -- some of my 

colleagues' concerns about this case-by-case 

approach. But I go back to the text, which is 

the text permits the states to do this and says 

unless, and it's the unless that's creating this 

problem, but the presumption is that there's no

 preemption, correct?

 MR. STEWART: That -- that's correct. 

And the point I was making about discrimination 

is, even if you assume kind of the worst-case 

scenario that this all becomes so complicated 

that banks decide it's just not worth trying to 

establish preemption under "prevents or 

significantly interferes with," they're still 

left with substantial protection against 

discriminatory laws which in other aspects --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Can we 

go to inherent in Justice Kavanaugh's earlier 

question of -- of co-counsel, and he said you're 

costing the banks money, and that's a greater 

burden than it was in Franklin.

of maximum or a minimum is a wrong way to look

 at this?

 MR. STEWART: Well, Franklin didn't 

cost the bank money in the sense of forcing it 

to make outlays, but it cost the bank money in 

the sense of making it more difficult for the

 bank to attract customers and thereby earn money 

on the accounts. That is, the bank officers

 testified it was more difficult to get consumers 

to sign up for savings accounts if you couldn't 

use the word "savings" in your pitch.  They had 

consumer surveys that showed that consumers were 

more likely to recognize the word "savings." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I understand 

that, but --

MR. STEWART: And -- and so I -- I 

think it would be for these purposes an 

artificial distinction to draw a line between 

state laws that require the state to lay out 

money and state laws that simply make it more 

difficult for the state to earn money. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then -- then 

answer why it's not a significant interference

MR. STEWART: I mean, one thing you

 would want to look at is to what extent could 

the bank earn money on the escrow account and 

what -- what relationship would that potential 

earning have to the interest it was required to 

pay out because, when people defend the use of 

escrow accounts in this setting, it's never on 

the ground that it's a good way for banks to 

earn a little money. It's on the ground that it 

protects the bank -- the bank's collateral 

against the possibility of failure to pay taxes, 

failure to maintain insurance, and escrow 

accounts are -- are very useful for those 

purposes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, in essence, 

you're almost saying this would be an easy case 

to prove?  If they can earn 5 percent and they 

just have to give up 2, there's no substantial 

interference?  There's no cost? 

MR. STEWART: That -- that would --

that would certainly be right. I think the more 

difficult --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and if --

if they can't earn any money on this money and 

they have to pay out, that might be?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

           JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, it might 

be that you have text on your side, but before 

we get to that question, I guess I'm interested 

in many of the inquiries that Justice Alito was 

making, and I'll just come at it a slightly 

different way. 

Yes, significance tests are common in 

the law, but they're not really common in 

preemption inquiries.  We don't really see a 

whole lot of preemption inquiries where we have 

to do this question of, like, how much is too 

much. 

And, you know, one reason we don't is 

you -- you need an answer that applies 

everywhere and for all time.  I -- I mean, 

significant effects, you could have no 

significant effect now and then 10 years from 

now, you're in a different economic environment 

and you could have a significant effect.  And 

does that mean it would be a kind of on/off

switch like one day the law applies and the next 

day, 10 years later, it doesn't?

 So add to Justice Alito's question

 about maybe different parties would present 

different records, maybe different states would 

have the exact same law, but the economic 

circumstances in those two states would be very

 different, so it looks as though the federal law 

preempts one state law and doesn't preempt the 

other state law.  It seems an odd kind of 

inquiry for a preemption question. 

MR. STEWART: I -- I guess the first 

thing I would say is -- and I'd point the -- the 

Court to the cases cited at the back end of Mr. 

Taylor's reply brief that talk about statutes 

like the Airline Deregulation Act, which 

preempts state laws relating to rates, routes, 

and services, and if you have a state law that 

specifies what rates or routes or services the 

airline can use, that's an easy case.  That --

that's preempted without regard to practical 

impacts. 

But the Court has also recognized 

sometimes states will regulate something else, 

but the regulation of something else will have a

 other formulations Congress could have chosen.

And perhaps out of desperation, the state argued 

that, well, when the federal statute says 

national banks may sell insurance in small

 towns, it only means they may do this if state

 law allows it.

 And the Court said that's not the way

 we usually understand federal authorizations to

National Bank Act says you can do something and 

state laws says you can't, the federal statute 

controls.

 MR. STEWART: The -- the statute says 

that for these mandatory -- mandatory accounts, 

accounts that are mandated by TILA, the bank 

must pay interest under applicable state or 

federal law. And so there's a question what --

about what "applicable" means.  And, certainly, 

with respect to applicable federal law, it would

 mean you'd have to point to some other federal 

statute that required interest to be paid on the 

escrow accounts. 

I think one -- one natural reading of 

that provision would be it doesn't establish a 

special rule for TILA account -- TILA-mandated 

accounts.  It just says, if you would be 

required to pay interest on this account were it 

voluntarily created, you have to do it if it's

sense that it's statute by statute, not case by

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And do you think

MR. STEWART: -- but -- but bank by

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  And do you think 

that this language, "case by case" -- I'm just 

looking in the statute. Do you think it is 

designed to say something about how courts 

conduct the preemption inquiry, you know, as in 

this case, because it was brought by a court 

versus the Comptroller of the Currency? 

Because I'm just looking at the way 

that it's structured.  You know, it says, "any 

preemption determination under this paragraph 

may be made by a court, or by regulation or 

order of the Comptroller of the Currency on a 

case-by-case basis," and then all of the 

subsequent references to "case-by-case basis" 

refer to the OCC determination.  Is -- is -- and 

I'm just asking, should I make anything of that?

the two things you should make of it are, first, 

yes, it is directed just to the OCC, and it

 seems to have been a reaction to the 2004 OCC 

regulations, which declared kind of broad 

categories of state law to be off the table.

 And the --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yes.

 MR. STEWART: And Congress was saying

particular state law --

is how I -- which is how I read it, so I'm 

wondering how much -- it just seems to me --

I'll -- I'll try to get to the point of why I'm 

wondering about it.  It seems like, you know, 

that phrase, "case-by-case basis," itself sounds 

fact-laden, like we're making factual 

determinations on a case-by-case basis, but if 

that language, "case-by-case basis," was 

designed to stop the OCC from doing what you're 

saying, does it really carry that implication 

here?

 basis. Yeah.

 MR. STEWART: -- a case-by-case basis.

 And -- and the most relevant language in that

 provision is that in making a case-by-case 

determination, the OCC must consider the impact

 of the particular state law.  And that seem --

 seems clearly to refer to the practical impact. 

And if that's part of the -- the 

substantive inquiry, then even though the same 

case-by-case requirement wouldn't apply to a 

court, the court should consider impact as well. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So do you think the 

court then is bound -- even though (b)(3) is 

referring to the Comptroller, do you think the 

court should be implying the exact same 

standard? 

MR. STEWART: I mean, the court is 

certainly bound by the same substantive 

standard.  If you look at (b)(1) --

 courts do.

 MR. STEWART:  Congress didn't have to

me then, of -- that the court -- I guess what

inquiry for a court.

 to Justice Alito's questions, is there a reason

legal claims? 

MR. STEWART: No.  I mean, national 

banks -- and be -- because we are talking about 

not the effect that this would have on somebody 

else but the effect it would have on the 

national banks themselves, not only do they have 

the wherewithal to -- to satisfy these 

requirements, but they're in the best position 

to have the relevant information. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And they have the 

wherewithal in part because there's nothing that 

prevents national banks from hiring lawyers and 

gathering evidence and presenting them to the 

court, right?

I mean, it would seem to me that the showing 

that a company employer would have to make in 

Title VII regarding undue burden on its business 

when accommodating religious employers is really 

no different in kind -- religious employees, 

excuse me -- is really no different in kind than 

the kind of thing a national bank would have to 

show if it says this is substantially 

interfering with my powers. 

MR. STEWART: Right.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So let 

me ask you about how often such a showing would 

have to necessarily be made.

 Did I understand you to say that the

 preemption determination always requires an

 evidentiary showing?  I think you kind of

 discussed that, but aren't there circumstances 

in which a big evidentiary showing wouldn't be

 necessary? 

MR. STEWART: Yes.  I mean, there 

certainly could be cases in which the nature of 

the restriction was -- had such an obvious 

impact on the bank that you wouldn't need at 

least any --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  An obvious impact, 

for example, like it's directly conflicting with 

what Congress says about the bank's powers? 

MR. STEWART: That -- that would be 

one example.  The -- another example would just 

be like charging -- the bank has to pay 15 or 

20 percent interest rate. 

Now, as Mr. Taylor pointed out, that 

-- that's not going to happen in the real world

requirement will take off the table a lot of the

 most extreme --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So this isn't going

 to -- the big evidentiary showing problem is not

 going to happen in every case in which the bank 

is making a claim about preemption?

 MR. STEWART: That -- that's correct. 

And I'd also point out the bank, to the extent 

at least that it's worried about enforcement by 

state officials, it doesn't have to wait to be 

sued. That is, Barnett Bank was a case in which 

the bank went into court itself and sought a 

declaratory judgment of preemption, and that 

would be available. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Bringing its 

evidence and its lawyers and that sort of thing. 

MR. STEWART: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Finally, 

with respect to Justice Kagan's question, I 

guess I'm wondering what, if anything, we can do 

about the oddity of the standard in this 

context.  It's in the statute, and so I don't 

know what -- whether we can just read the 

statute to say something other than it says

we certainly agree that you can read the

 statutory language in light of the Barnett Bank

 opinion because -- both because the -- the

 statute --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  The statute tells 

you you're supposed to do that.

 MR. STEWART: It -- it did, both by 

drawing specific language from Barnett Bank and 

by including a separate citation to Barnett Bank 

itself.  But I -- I don't think the Court can --

can get away from the fact that Congress chose 

this particular formulation as its distillation 

of the Barnett Bank opinion. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And that's because, 

you -- as you said in the beginning, 

"significantly affects" means something, right? 

That Congress has actually used another 

formulation if it just wants preemption

unduly burden national banks, destroying their

 uniform federal character.

 Now the other side posits that 

"significantly interferes" requires factual 

proof that a state law would hinder a banking

 power to some unspecified degree.  But 

"significantly interferes" can be both

 quantitative and qualitative.

 And a state law that dictates the 

attributes of a banking product interferes with 

national banking power in a qualitative effect, 

just as a -- courts telling prosecutors what 

charges to bring would significantly interfere 

with executive power. 

Barnett Bank uses the term 

"significantly interferes" in a qualitative 

sense. Barnett Bank reasons that state laws are 

preempted absent any indication that Congress 

intended to subject the banking power to local 

conditions. 

And, here, we know Congress intended 

the opposite.  First, Congress -- excuse me, 

federal law comprehensively regulates state 

mortgage escrow accounts in order to protect 

consumers without requiring any interest.  And,

 second, Congress speaks expressly when it

 contemplates state interest laws.  It did so for

 state usury laws, and Dodd-Frank itself requires 

interest on certain mortgage escrow loans but

 not Petitioners'.

 It is unfathomable that Congress

 intended the other side's test.  They never told 

you what interest rate would be too much, what

 to do when market forces change, and how courts 

should proceed bank by bank.  But national banks 

need to know their regulatory obligations ahead 

of time.  It would create seismic uncertainty if 

the laws of 50 states could apply to every 

banking product and service and not just every 

feature of a mortgage but everything from 

interest rates on savings and checking accounts 

to ATM fees to credit card reward programs. 

Congress surely intended a preemption 

standard that preserves the stability and 

predictability that undergirds a safe and sound 

banking system. 

I welcome questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Blatt, do we 

treat express banking powers the same as 

incidental banking powers?  It would seem that

you would have to somehow have a way to fathom

 what these incidental powers are.

 MS. BLATT: Right.  No, there's --

there's enumerated powers in the 7th of 12 

U.S.C. 24, and incidental powers are defined as

 necessary powers to the business of banking.

 And I can't think of a more -- so the 

only enumerated ones are basically lend money, 

take deposits, and then make real estate loans 

in 371.  What interest you charge is so 

fundamental to a banking product and the banking 

power that it would seem absurd to say a state 

could dictate the interest rate on something 

like a savings account just because that's an 

incidental power. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I agree with 

you on that.  And did -- in Franklin, though, I 

think it was statutory, right?  It was express. 

But what I'm more interested in is the 

creation of an escrow account, then interest 

rate on the escrow account, which is not sort of 

the -- something a bank would normally have to 

do. 

MS. BLATT: That's correct.  I mean, 

13 state laws require it.  Since 1973, I guess,

we've had the Real Estate Settlement Practice 

Act that never required interest. It's got 

40,000 words of regulations, 17 interpretive

 statements, and 10 appendices regulating escrow 

accounts and federal law, none of it requires

 interest.

 I think the other side would think 

states now could make amendments to every single

 one of those requirements and somehow states --

banks would have to run and get declaratory 

judgment as to each and every requirement just 

on escrows.  And then, when you cascade that 

across everything a bank does, it is 

mind-boggling.  It is mind-boggling how many 

products and services national banks do. 

And I'm not sure why we're talking 

about God and the airlines in a national banking 

case when we have 150 years of precedent that 

culminates in Barnett Bank.  And you have 30 

words of text.  You basically have Congress

mean by that is we look to see is there some

 indication that Congress wanted the -- wanted to 

subject the power of national banks to local

 conditions.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  There 

are amici and the logic of the Second Circuit

 law would suggest -- and -- and your test and 

the Second Circuit's test that no state consumer

 law would be permitted.  But there's an express 

permission for state consumer laws. 

So which ones are you going to say are 

okay? 

MS. BLATT: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All of them cost 

the bank money, whether it's giving a -- giving 

a disclosure form or a notice form.  Everything 

costs money. 

So what's incidental that somehow 

would -- wouldn't be preempted under the Second 

Circuit test? 

MS. BLATT: Sure.  Let me tell you. 

So the definition of "state consumer financial 

law" versus the law that's preempted under our

Of course, states are regulating, but

 what is being controlled?  Is it the national 

banking power or is it the financial transaction

 and the words of that definition with the

 consumer?  And when a state dictate --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, what --

what's not --

MS. BLATT: I'm going to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- controlling the 

financial transaction with the consumer here? 

MS. BLATT: I'm going to give you both 

the definition and a laundry list of state law. 

The definition is this:  When the state dictates 

the attribute of the product and service as 

opposed to the interaction with the consumer, 

it's preempted.  And under that definition, you 

have banking-specific laws that aren't 

preempted, like laws that prohibit racial 

discrimination and whatnot.  You have laws that 

-- prohibit fraud by banks. 

And most importantly, you have the 

banking-specific escheat law in Anderson. 

That's their leading case, and yet I think it's 

our best case.  The Court said that the only --

what the state did, the banking-specific law,

holder who had the lawful right to demand 

payment, i.e., the deposit account.

 But then five times in the opinion the

 Court said you are not -- the state law is not 

-- and, I'm going to quote because they say --

rely on it -- "not an unlawful encroachment on 

the rights and privileges of national banks." 

It's not infringing or interfering with any 

authorized function of the bank. It's not a 

denial of its privileges as a federal 

instrumentality and so on. 

The other categories of laws that are 

not preempted that meet the definition of state 

consumer financial law are all generally 

applicable laws that regulate the manner and 

terms of the financial transaction with the 

consumer. 

So there's lots -- every state law has 

a law of majority when you can buy a mortgage.

law has room to play on the dual banking system 

said state contract law controls. And then 

you've had case after case making a dividing 

line between protecting the -- the banking power

 powers, and -- on the one hand, and state law, 

where it can creep in when you're talking about

 the interaction -- transactions with consumers. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But aren't --

aren't -- aren't the national banks interacting 

with consumers pursuant to their power?  So why 

don't those two categories collapse? 

MS. BLATT: They don't because, in 

1870, you said they didn't.  You said -- there's 

no federal common law of contracts.  There's no 

federal law -- common law of torts.  States in 

-- the Court said, in their daily lives, banks 

can be regulated more by states than -- than the 

federal law because the states have to supply 

state contract law, tort law.

 functions."

 So, I mean, yes, you picked out some 

language that suggests that this is about sort 

of power at some level of generality. But it 

seemed to me that this was about whether this --

the -- the law at issue in that case was "so 

burdensome" as to be inapplicable. It wasn't

 about the nature.  It was about, as people have 

said, the degree. 

MS. BLATT: I think you're absolutely 

correct.  In Anderson, and when it contrasts the 

California case, is talking about an undue 

burden because it didn't affect the power.  And 

what the Court said -- and that's why we have 

two tests.  We have a fallback test.  One is, if 

it affects the national banking power and 

controls the attribute of the product, 

preempted, preempted, preempted. 

There is a second undue burden test 

that looks at the practical impact, but the --

the -- the delta between the two sides is we 

think that can be as a matter of law and looks 

-- it looks at a patchwork across 50 states.

without any factual record.

 In Anderson, it said it -- it wasn't

 preempted with any factual record.  They say 

with no case, not one case in 150 years of 

precedent, would this Court look to a factual

 record.  They're relying on some trial court

 record?  That's their best case? When the --

the Supreme Court didn't even talk about it? I

 think that is -- pretty much tells you all you 

need to know whether Congress intended a factual 

record for banking preemption. 

Now, on the OCC, I think, you know, 

there are three reasons why it is just simply 

implausible that by codifying Barnett Bank, 

Congress tended to overrule it or somehow upset 

it. And the first is what I already mentioned, 

the 30 words of text that says you need to 

follow Barnett Bank. 

And the second is there is a specific 

provision in 25b(c), we rely on it, the OCC 

relies on it, that says OCC must follow the 

legal standard of Barnett Bank, without any 

reference to the "prevents or significantly 

interferes."  So they can't possibly mean two 

separate things.  Congress told OCC to follow

Barnett Bank, not to look at significant effect.

 And the third reason we think it's 

just completely doubly bizarre and backwards 

that you would take Congress being mad at the 

OCC and imposing procedural requirements is 

somehow they intended to impose a new 

substantive standard on courts when they weren't 

mad at you, they weren't mad at courts, and it

 impose a -- a standard that no one's ever heard 

of or applied before, that you would go fact by 

fact -- fact by fact, law by law, bank by bank. 

And he did a little fancy footwork 

when you said, would this proceed bank by bank? 

He answered by saying, well, that would be the 

OCC. He never told you what would happen with 

Justice Alito's, you know, question about what 

would happen if Bank of America couldn't prove 

it, but, you know, another national bank, Citi, 

Citibank, could do it? There's no answer to 

that. 

And in terms of the impact, you know, 

the notion that -- Mr. Stewart speaking on 

behalf of not of the OCC but the Justice 

Department, that you just have to look sort of 

at the records of the bank, the biggest problem

this a very easy case, is today 2 percent is 

four times the national savings. At the time of

 Mr. Cantero's, it was 33 percent times the

 national savings rate. And at the -- excuse me, 

that's Mr. Hymes. At the time of Mr. Cantero, 

it's 10 times. I don't know what -- what you

 think. Maybe you should let the courts know.

 Let's look at ATM fees.  Four dollars 

sounds -- I don't know, maybe 1.50?  And then we 

can go to credit card reward programs.  We'd 

have to have a consumer survey. I think I'd 

like 2 percent back on my credit card, but maybe 

states say it has to be 4 percent.  And I just 

don't even know how they would do this. 

In terms of what the impact is, 

Justice Jackson, you know, banks are in the 

business of money, so the impact is not just the 

potential for confusion and duplication and 

inconsistency and the sheer 50 state regulators 

that you'd have to contend with and the laws are 

constantly changing, but most things with banks, 

if you take it out of one hand, it -- you know,

Congress studied this in 1973, they said --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, Ms. Blatt, I 

thought all the national banks were pretty much 

the same in terms of their powers.  Like I

 thought we were talking about what in -- what --

what a state law is doing to the national bank

 power. So it's not at the level of a particular

 bank. It is -- and any of the banks could make 

the argument, and once they do, it would come up 

to the Supreme Court and we would decide 

ultimately, right? 

MS. BLATT: Well, that's this case. 

The Second Circuit said a mortgage -- mortgage 

escrow account is a direct assault on national 

bank power. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: I guess I just don't 

understand why it's so hard.  Like we do --

MS. BLATT: I don't think it is hard. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, no. What 

I'm saying is you're making the argument that it 

is really going to be very challenging for banks 

if we rule against you in this case, and I don't 

understand why that's the case. 

MS. BLATT: Well, you have, since the 

Reagan administration, a former OCC comptroller

comptrollers from Reagan to -- all the way with

 the Biden officials.  You haven't even heard

 from the OCC, which regulates the national 

banking system. That alone should scare you

 tremendously, that you don't even have the OCC

 up here.

 In terms of how hard it would be, I

 don't think I've heard a satisfactory answer on 

what interest rate would be too much and how 

national banks could make that showing.  But 

take just interest rates on savings accounts.  I

have to --

substantially interferes.  If your answer is I 

don't know what we would show, then I guess you

 on point.  And both -- and I also think it's

 significant that the Court in Watters, that's 

the Supreme Court, I mean, that's -- that's 

actually you, you read Barnett Bank and had the

 most sweeping language you could possibly have 

about what Barnett Bank meant, and it said

 states cannot control banks, period.  That's the

 Supreme Court.  That interpreted Barnett Bank. 

So, you know -- and that's why I think OCC has 

always taken this position. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're taking that 

quote out of context because I looked at it.  It 

says the states can exercise no control over 

national banks, nor in any way affect their 

operation except insofar as Congress may see 

proper to permit. 

MS. BLATT: Sure.  For sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's what 

the whole issue is, how far did Congress permit 

here.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The -- the state

 statutes have to be non-discriminatory.

 MS. BLATT: Correct.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, you know, one way 

you could look at this is, if a state statute is

 non-discriminatory, how much damage could it 

really be doing? 

MS. BLATT: And I think that's part of 

the problem, which is what the Franklin case 

illustrates and what this case illustrates, is 

the plaintiffs will always say, well, you 

applied it to your state banks, so what's the 

problem?  And the problem --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the question. 

MS. BLATT: The problem goes much 

deeper --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it -- it seems 

as though there should be a kind of presumption 

that if the state is doing it for the state 

banks, it's not really interfering with bank 

powers in a way that we should care about. 

There might be exceptions to that, and that's

what the -- the -- the language is designed to 

accomplish, is to, you know, to pick the

 exceptions to that where something has gone 

kerflooey such that even a non-discriminatory

 law does something special to national banks.

 MS. BLATT: So two responses.  I think 

Franklin would have come out the other way

 because there was -- the -- the -- the New York

 Court of Appeals said there's not a sufficient 

showing.  But, more importantly, and this, I 

think, goes to the congressional design of the 

National Bank Act, is that they're supposed to 

be -- you know, why have your name Bank of 

America if you look like Bank of Ocean City or 

Bank of Hawaii?  You're supposed to be able to 

walk into Bank of America and get one product 

and not have 50 products in 50 states, and every 

time a state says change your escrow, you have 

to change another aspect of the loan --

Congress set is it's not preempted unless

 discrimination or you can -- you can prove

 significant impact.  So that -- we can't take 

that argument very seriously, that it's just too

 much of a -- an impairment on national banks. 

They have to deal with reality that we live in a 

federal system with 50 states.

 MS. BLATT: Yeah.  I mean, it just 

seems like you're kind of reading the provision, 

I mean, upside down.  You could read Barnett 

Bank the same way and say this Court had --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You say "upside 

down," but I -- I'm -- that's what the statute 

says.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that's what 

Congress said, right? 

MS. BLATT: I agree.  And I think that 

-- the Court said it's preempted under Barnett 

Bank if it prevents or significantly interferes. 

And then you go to Barnett Bank and it tells 

you, I think five times, that we read it in 

light of Franklin.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You mentioned 

earlier that you thought state lending laws with 

respect to race, religion, and others are not

 preempted.  Why?

 MS. BLATT: So the -- the case --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  On your view, if --

if -- if states get -- if states don't get a 

role and you really -- Barnett Bank should be

 inverting the statute, and the presumption is 

national banks operate free of state control, 

that would seem to subsume those laws too --

MS. BLATT: So no for -- for this 

fundamental reason, and that is that states have 

-- I'm sorry, national banks have no power 

whatsoever to discriminate on the basis of race 

or to commit fraud. 

And this Court in the 1924 case of 

First National Bank versus Missouri said when it 

said that state law that bans national banks 

from having bank branches, the Court said it 

can't preempt it because there's no either -- no 

express power or even implied power to do 

branches.

bank power.  And for sure that's what fair 

lending laws do. It says, you know, you can't 

make the loan decisions that you want to make, 

except conditional on your satisfying some state 

law. A lot of state laws can be explained in 

just that way, and that's -- I -- I think that 

that's the test you use in your brief.

a condition on a national bank's power.

 there's a bit of wanting your cake and eating it

 too here.

 MS. BLATT: No, because we're happy

 with again the -- the -- your precedent.  Your

 precedent has been very careful to make sure 

that states can go right up to the line. And I

 think Anderson says that.

 You can talk about, you know, you can

 interact with the account holder and the bank in 

things like contract law, age requirements, 

statute of frauds, and if I can get back to 

discriminatory lending, banks don't have any 

power to discriminate on the basis of race, 

gender, sex, sexual orientation, but they sure 

have to discriminate on the basis of income 

status. 

So yes, if a state law said you can't 

discriminate on the basis of income, that's 

going to preempt it because there's a federal 

duty to mitigating at risk. 

But this is, again -- and -- and same 

way with fraud, I don't think fair lending laws, 

state lending laws that prohibit fraud in 

lending are preempted either.  They just have 

never been.

 under your test?

 MS. BLATT: I don't think so, but it 

-- even if they did, it's still -- the line that

 we're drawing is the line this Court has drawn I

 think since -- since Anderson and before that, 

that if you're not changing the attribute -- and 

I don't think it changes the loan attribute to 

say is the person black or white or green. It's 

still a loan with the same interest rate, the 

same term. 

If you say state law says I don't want 

national banks paying less than 2 percent or 

3 percent or 4 percent on savings accounts or no 

mortgage loans that are under 29 months and --

and 10 months, it's just the product. That is 

literally the -- the product. 

And I think we talked about the credit 

cards and the ATM fees, how much cash you can 

withdraw.  How much cash you can withdraw has 

nothing to do with the consumer walking in. It 

literally is the core banking service itself. 

And this has been the workable standard.  This 

has been the settled expectation.

you have to pay interest on the escrow account

 consumer walking in?

 MS. BLATT: Nothing.  It's the nature 

of the product. It's the interest rate on the

 loan. It's no different than -- there's plenty 

of state laws that control, you know, things 

like the term of the loan, what's the maximum 

amount you can take out on a mortgage loan. 

Those are all -- those are all preempted, yet 

states regulate that for state banks. 

This has been -- I mean, again, we've 

talked about the OCC. This has been the law 

since 1983 for all real estate but for things 

like escrow.  The escrow regulation came in in 

2004. 

So national banks but for the Ninth 

Circuit, which I think covers two state escrow 

laws, national banks don't comply with state 

escrow laws unless they want to because it's one 

of the features they want to do to attract 

consumers.

these are very small dollar amounts.  Bank of

I'm making this up on the fly. 

But suppose there were a state that 

said something like before a loan can be denied, 

a person has a right to see the bank president. 

And that's very -- it's actually really super 

inconvenient for the bank.  That would fall on 

your yes, a state can do that side of the line?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm with Justice

 Kagan.

 MS. BLATT: -- I think that's fair on 

the product, we may have only mentioned the

 product thing once.  The main -- the main test 

is the control test that the Second Circuit

 applied. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, it's totally 

different than the control test, isn't it? 

MS. BLATT: No, because --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The -- the test 

you're asking us to adopt.  And wouldn't it, you 

know, this product versus consumer test itself 

generate a lot of litigation over border cases? 

MS. BLATT: I don't think so.  When we 

tried to talk about the difference with the 

definition of "state consumer financial law," we 

talked about -- this is where it gets very 

close. We talked about there's a difference 

between controlling the banking power and 

controlling the financial transaction with the 

consumer.  And I just think the explanation to 

that just looks to the product.

 lending laws, which everybody thinks kind of

 have to apply to national banks, apply to

 national banks, but nothing else does.

 MS. BLATT: Yeah, and I -- I -- I

 don't think it's gerrymandering unless you think

 the OCC has gerrymandered.  I mean, you've had 

to have a workable rule since states have had --

excuse me, since national banks have had real 

estate lending power since 1983. 

And this has been the workable rule. 

It -- the -- the OCC has cordoned off the loan. 

But it has -- it has said at the same time and 

it wrote to Barney Frank in 2004 but we're going 

to put fair lending laws to the side. 

Now there might be some fair lending 

laws that might be problematic when they run up 

to the duty to mitigate risk, but, generally, 

banks just don't have the power to discriminate 

or commit fraud.  And if -- if you can't ever 

answer a question at oral argument in the brief, 

then I'm not sure why we're having oral 

argument. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It's pretty central. 

Don't -- it's not -- it's not an incidental 

question.  It's -- it's what's preempted.  And

 MS. BLATT: I think our -- yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And -- and -- and 

now you're saying, well, there's this new 

distinction that we somehow distilled from our

 cases that heretofore nobody has mentioned.

 MS. BLATT: So the amount of

 non-preempted laws is the exact same in the 

brief, the fair lending and all generally 

applicable laws that go to how you form 

contracts.  The only one I add -- and Anderson. 

The only one I added is the fraud laws. I don't 

think those are in the briefs, but I think they 

follow.  So, if you don't want to consider the 

fraud laws, that's fine. 

But the basic distinction and dividing 

line, we spent pages and pages saying this Court 

has recognized all the laws that aren't 

preempted, starting with state contract laws.

 understanding the -- the difference between a

 state law that affects a national bank's 

exercise of the banking power and a state law 

that regulates the way in which the bank 

exercises that power in dealing with its

 customers.

 I mean, maybe -- is there some other

 way to express this?  Is there something else,

 if we look at the instances that have been held 

to fall on the latter side of that line, some 

other characteristic that could be identified 

that would explain the difference? 

MS. BLATT: Well, the -- the reason 

why I like what I'm giving you is it's because 

it's -- the statute defines "state consumer 

financial laws" in terms of the transaction.  So 

we stuck to the text of "financial transaction." 

And we think Barnett Bank is talking 

about the national banking power, but because 

there is this sort of semantic issue, while 

"regulate" is "regulate," are you regulating the 

power, or are you regulating the transaction, it 

helps to explain what that means. 

If you wanted the case, it would be 

Anderson.  Anderson talks about it is just a

garnishment or a missing person, but it doesn't

 bank. And this is a loan.  This is literally

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But we are -- there --

an answer, well, I'll have to think about it, as

preempt nothing. 

If -- if you can presume that anything

definition, nothing is going to be preempted.

because I think I've got the status quo on my

 side. What they have is that Congress was

 really angry at OCC.  But there's no suggestion 

in the legislative history or anything else that

 they wanted to create all this massive

 stability.

 This is a time of the great recession.

 Like the notion that they wanted to impose on 

every national bank some query of we no longer 

know whether the laws of 50 states apply to 

every single thing we do, without anyone 

noticing, it just seems to me that -- that this

I think the word "significant" does some work

 because it does -- it does a significant amount 

of work because not any law that could be said

 to interfere with the banking power, we've

 talked about the fair lending laws, talked about

 the age requirements, the writing requirements, 

it has to be significant and it has to go to 

the, you know, authorized federal power.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Is -- is what 

-- is the thing that's codified the words taken 

from Barnett Bank, "significantly interferes," 

et cetera, or is it the holding of Barnett Bank? 

Is it how Barnett Bank itself understood those 

words? 

MS. BLATT: The latter.  I think --

you could say it's both, but it's clearly the 

latter.  I think, in their view, you didn't have 

to enact any reference to Barnett Bank because 

they just start with significant interference. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And "case by case"? 

MS. BLATT: "Case by case" refers to 

the OCC in terms of their saying, if you're 

going to proceed by order or regulation, you'd 

have to just look at escrow laws because it has 

to be a substantial -- I mean, you might have a

 escrow laws.  But "case by case" is not

 referring to facts.  It's referring to you can't 

just say we want to preempt everything on 

mortgage loans. You have to look at, like, you 

know, escrow, down payment, maximum, you have to

 just go kind of law by law.  But it's talking

MS. BLATT: Correct.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- which you've 

talked about. And the problem I'm having with 

your distinction between product or power and

 the transaction is that in California, the Court

 describes the law at issue there, which it says 

is preempted, as a statute that attempts to

 qualify in an unusual way agreements between 

national banks and their customers and may cause 

them to hesitate to subject their funds to 

possible confiscation. 

So it seems as though the Court in 

this case says the reason why you're preempted 

is because you are trying -- this law is trying 

to regulate the transaction between the bank, 

which you say is the reason why in Anderson they 

would say it's not preempted. 

MS. BLATT: So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I don't -- I'm --

I'm --

MS. BLATT: Yeah, a hundred percent. 

And we're -- we're -- you're -- you're just 

completely correct.  What we're saying is you 

have the control on the power of the banking 

product, and there's a second fallback test,

which is the undue burden, and that undue burden 

is the practical impact.

 So if you had a state law that said --

that is the difference between California and

 the Kentucky law -- that said the minimum age 

requirement is 61 to open up a mortgage, well,

 that is a law of -- you know, a -- the law of

 majority.  It clearly would impose an unusual

 relationship on the relationship between the 

bank and its customers.  So we do think you 

could go and preempt these laws that do interact 

with the consumer and the state. 

Another one would be a state --

national banks or any bank can only be open for 

one hour during the week.  That's going to be 

preempted.  Or you have to pay tellers $1,000 an 

hour. It's going to be preempted even though, 

of course, Title VII applies to national banks. 

But I do think the California case 

leaves open, and Anderson says, if the -- if the 

state law is so unusual with respect to the bank 

and its consumers to the -- the point that it's 

interfering with their operations, it will be 

preempted.

 Rebuttal, Mr. Taylor?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN E. TAYLOR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. TAYLOR: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. Just a few quick points in rebuttal.

 My friend says that the statute 

contains two different tests, one for when 

states dictate the attributes of the product or 

service, which I think she said is preempted, 

preempted, preempted, and a second undue burden 

test for some other category of laws. 

Now that test is made up, atextual, 

and, yes, Justice Gorsuch, appears for the first 

time at argument.  And this Court in Cuomo, I'll 

just note, rejected a similarly atextual test, 

although it's not exactly the same, as 

inconsistent with the text of the statute.  And 

the same is true here. 

Now they read 30 words of the text of 

the statute, which they say is a love letter to 

Barnett Bank, as excising the very standard that 

is codified and is nullifying seven pages of 

their statutory appendix, which is the entire

statute, so that the statute would have no

 real-world effect.

 Now, Justice Sotomayor, you pointed 

out that the statute here uses the phrase "only 

if," which is somewhat unusual for a preemption 

provision, and suggests that in the real world

 it's as much an anti-preemption clause as a

 preemption clause.

 But it's not an exotic provision, 

Justice Kagan. And if you look at page 15 of 

our reply brief, this Court has actually adopted 

a significant impact test.  That's the word this 

Court has used, even though it's not in the text 

of the statute, in the "related to" cluster of 

-- of cases. And this Court made that up as an 

administrable line.  And if it's comfortable 

with that as the line when it's not in the 

statute, then it should be comfortable with that 

as the line when it is in the statute. 

Now there was a cluster of questions 

about the practical effect, and I just would say 

three things.  The first is the importance of a 

non-discriminatory law. It's why a lot of their 

laws are hypos and not reality, Justice Kagan. 

But, Justice Alito, that doesn't mean

that that is the entire test, just like it would

 have been under the Treasury Department.  You 

still have laws that conflict, as in Barnett

 Bank, and you still have laws that -- where

 there's a real significant interference.

 Justice Kagan, you gave a hypo where a

 bank couldn't make a loan unless a person could 

talk to the president of the bank. If that's

 non-discriminatory, it sounds a lot like 

significant interference to me. 

And there's -- the third point I would 

make is there's still a role for the OCC to play 

here. It can do the job that Congress had 

expected it to do if -- if -- if there is a real 

problem, like my other -- my friend on the other 

side claims. 

And their position that this would sow 

mayhem is pretty offensive to federalism.  The 

idea is that nationwide companies might have to 

comply with non-discriminatory state laws that 

don't conflict with the text of a statute in the 

states where they do business and that they 

should be entitled to preempt those statutes as 

a matter of law without having to show 

significant interference.  And I think that's

just inconsistent with the way this typically 

approaches questions under the Supremacy Clause.

 And, finally, I would note that --

it's quite clear that Congress passed this

 statute to do something.  It was a reacting 

against what the OCC had done. The OCC said the

 same 2004 rule remains in effect and the same

 list of laws are preempted.  And Congress said 

no, we want the statute to have some real 

effect.  And my friend on the other side reads 

the statute to have no real-world effect. 

Thank you very much.
