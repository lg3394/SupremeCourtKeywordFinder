CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument next in Case 23-51, Bissonnette versus 

LePage Bakeries. 

Ms. Bennett. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER D. BENNETT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MS. BENNETT: Thank you. Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Less than two years ago, in Southwest 

versus Saxon, this Court carefully examined the 

text and history of the Federal Arbitration 

Act's worker exemption, and it held that the 

exemption applies to "any class of workers 

directly involved in transporting goods across 

state or international borders." 

Flowers now asks this Court to add an 

additional unwritten requirement that the 

worker's employer must sell transportation. 

According to Flowers, if the thousands of truck 

drivers who work full-time hauling its goods 

were only implied -- employed by a trucking 

company that Flowers had hired to do so, then 

they'd be exempt transportation workers. But,

because Flowers essentially created its own 

in-house trucking company, it says that those 

same truck drivers are no longer transportation 

workers. 

That distinction has no basis in the 

text of the statute. Flowers' only attempt at a 

textual argument is its invocation of ejusdem 

generis, but that argument fails from the start 

because Flowers can't identify a single example 

of the word "seamen" ever being defined based on 

whether a worker's employer sold transportation. 

In fact, if Flowers' drivers were on 

boats rather than trucks, under Flowers' own 

definition of "seamen," they would be seamen. 

In the words of Saxon, that "sinks [the 

company's] ejusdem generis argument." 

Unable to rely on the text, Flowers 

pivots to administrability. But, even if this 

Court could rewrite statutes to make them easier 

to apply, Flowers' rule is anything but 

workable. Flowers can't even explain how it 

would apply in this very case. 

This Court should reject Flowers' 

attempt to add to the FAA an employer-based 

industry requirement that is both atextual and

unworkable. 

I welcome this Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: If this case is 

decided in your favor, would it affect the 

separate question of whether or not this --

these drivers are engaged in intrastate 

deliveries? 

MS. BENNETT: No, I don't think it 

would. The only question -- you know, as this 

case comes to the Court, built into the question 

presented is the assumption that the workers are 

members of a class of workers engaged in 

interstate commerce. It wouldn't affect that at 

all. 

The only question here is, assuming 

that to be true, is there an additional 

requirement that the individual plaintiffs be 

employed by a company that's in the 

transportation industry? 

JUSTICE THOMAS: So why would the 

inquiry into transportation industry be any more 

complicated than the inquiry into transportation 

workers? 

MS. BENNETT: So, by -- by 

"transportation workers," I take it you mean

whether someone is directly involved? 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Yeah. 

MS. BENNETT: So -- so I think there 

are -- I -- I think there are certainly going to 

be edge cases about whether some -- a class of 

workers is directly involved in transporting 

goods across state or international borders. I 

-- we concede that. But what Flowers is asking 

is that we adopt an additional requirement on 

top of that that wouldn't obviate that inquiry. 

So take, for example, Amazon. So it 

has trucks traveling across the highway. It has 

planes in the air. Maybe there's a difficult 

question about whether those, you know, say, 

truckers are directly involved in transporting 

goods across borders. But what Flowers says is, 

in addition to figuring out that question, we 

also have to figure out whether Amazon sells 

transportation. 

So, you know, how do we know? Do we 

need discovery into whether it sells 

transportation? Does it matter who it sells it 

to? Does it just have to sell it to its

percentage of its price is in revenues? All of 

these are going to be difficult questions that 

are then layered on top of the question you 

raised, which is already in the text of the 

statute. 

And so -- and in Amazon's case, for 

example, it doesn't get us out of the question 

you raised. It just adds an additional one on 

top. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: In your opening,

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But, in ejusdem 

generis cases, by definition, we're not 

following the literal text of the residual 

clause. Instead, we're looking at the listed 

items and trying to discern what connects those 

listed items, what feature of those listed items 

is common. And as -- as the Scalia-Garner

indeterminate. A difficult position for judges,

want to get your reaction to is Congress took 

them out of this arbitration regime. All 

workers, all contracts of employment are subject 

to arbitration. It takes them out, but it takes 

them out -- seemingly, you have to look at the 

legal context, I would think, because they had a 

separate arbitration regime that already 

existed. 

In other words, at least as I read the 

record, and it is murky in parts, I'll grant 

you, as of 1925, Congress didn't want anyone to 

be outside of arbitration. They wanted 

Section 2 for most workers and then not for 

seamen and railroad employees because there was 

a separate arbitration regime. 

Why, when we look at the common legal 

context that connects those terms, isn't that 

the correct way to look at it? Why is that 

wrong? 

MS. BENNETT: There's two answers to 

that. One is we know that Congress wasn't 

exempting just workers who had alternative 

dispute resolution regimes because it added the 

residual clause, and that residual clause would 

have covered no workers at all at the time.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: At the time, but 

what Congress was doing, arguably -- this is the 

argument -- was contemplating that there would 

be future industries that would fit in. And in 

1936, the airline industry comes in, and those 

employees are funneled into the same kind of 

separate arbitration -- or the railway 

arbitration regime. So that Congress was 

accommodating the future. 

MS. BENNETT: Sure. So the -- the 

second historical answer to that is, even if 

this Court were going to try to discern some 

purpose of the exemption and instead of focusing 

specifically on the text, which is difficult a 

hundred years later, you know, if you look at 

seamen, I think one of the assumptions under 

that -- underlying that question is seamen 

had -- were going to arbitration, that there was 

a mandatory arbitration scheme that covered 

seamen, and that's actually just -- just not 

correct. 

So the Shipping Commissioners Act, 

which is the statute that provided for shipping 

commissioner arbitration for seamen, two things 

about that. It wasn't limited to employers who

sold transportation, so it was -- it had 

geographic limitations. It was about seamen who 

were traveling abroad, coast to coast, and some 

coastwise seamen, like the people on lumber 

boats who would have been employed in lumber 

companies. 

So, even if you think that's the 

purpose of the exemption, is to accommodate 

these alternative dispute resolution schemes, 

adding an employer-based industry requirement 

would actually conflict with that purpose. 

But I also want to take a step back 

and talk about what the dispute resolution 

scheme was governing seamen at the time, and 

this Court has discussed that in its U.S. Bulk 

Carriers case, and what the Court said is, you 

know, from the beginning of time essentially, 

seamen have been wards of the court. They've 

been subject to the court's protection with a 

right to bring cases in court. And since 1790, 

Congress had enshrined that right in statutes. 

And what the Shipping Commissioners 

Act did is it said, if certain seamen, after a 

dispute arises, if they agree with the master of 

their boat in writing to go to the -- to the

And what this Court held is that 

imposing a pre-dispute mandatory arbitration 

scheme would conflict with this age-old right to 

go to court --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: So you think 

Congress in 1925 wanted seamen to be able to go 

straight to court?

right. And I think that's what the --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Where -- is there 

anything to support that? 

MS. BENNETT: Sure. So -- so there 

are a few things. One is what this Court said 

in U.S. Bulk Carriers. If you look at the title 

of the U.S. Code, which is Title 46, enacted in 

the -- 1925, the same year that the Federal 

Arbitration Act was enacted, what you'll see is 

references all of the -- a lot of the rights. 

The references say you can go to court. 

And if you look at the Shipping 

Commissioners Act itself, it only applies if, 

after the dispute has arisen, the parties to the 

dispute agree in writing to go to arbitration.

You know, I think, if you -- if you 

look at the history, what was happening is that 

there were, you know, strike after strike in the 

transportation -- among transportation workers, 

and -- and -- in -- and among maritime workers 

specifically, the strikes were -- were -- the 

core of those strikers were lumber boats, people 

who were not employed by employers in the 

transportation industry. 

And -- and to the extent that what 

Congress was doing is saying, these people are 

really important to our economy and every time 

they strike they are interrupting commerce, you 

know, the -- the seamen strike amongst the 

lumber boats in 1923 interrupted the whole 

building boom on the West Coast, and so --

that courts do and that group-based arbitration 

does is it makes transparent issues that are 

coming up amongst transportation workers and 

amongst these companies, and it gives Congress 

and the executive branch, which was often 

involved in these disputes in the past, insight 

into -- into how these disputes are arising and 

maybe the potential for heading them off. 

And so I do think there's a modern 

reason, you know, to the extent we think that 

was the reason in 1925, it's no different now in 

what it -- in that people going to court and 

people going to sort of labor-based grievance, 

group-based arbitration like in the railroad 

statutes would -- would flag these kinds of 

disputes perhaps before they end up, you know, 

in nationwide strikes that are going to 

interrupt commerce.

they're not transportation workers because they 

do more that's office-based. They're --

they're -- they're not a traditional 

transportation worker. 

How do you deal with that? If -- if 

someone's job is, you know, at the end of the

deliver it from here to somewhere else, that's 

enough for you?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Go ahead. 

MS. BENNETT: -- which is I think what 

you're raising is the question of some workers 

have different tasks that they do and how do --

how do we deal with that question. And the --

the first stab I would take at that is to look 

at this Court's decision in Saxon actually. 

You know, Ms. Saxon in Saxon spent 

three days a week roughly loading and unloading 

cargo and two days a week supervising other 

people. And what this Court said is three days 

a week is enough. We don't need to look at

whether the supervision counts. 

And -- and, you know, so -- and so 

there may be, I think, tough questions in very 

few cases actually where people are -- are 

having multiple jobs. I'll note that these 

aren't -- I -- we haven't seen them in the lower 

courts. It doesn't come up often. 

And there are -- and the way I would 

deal with answering them, you know, if it's say 

less than Saxon but more than never is -- is to 

look -- you know, I would do two things. One is 

I would look in 1925 and see, for example, how 

much, you know, of the time did someone have to 

spend doing the kinds of work that somebody is 

doing to be a seaman and a railroad employee. 

I'd also note that this comes up in 

other statutory regimes and I might look at 

those cases. So, for example, there's a whole 

body of law around the Jones Act, which is the 

case that involve -- the statute governing when 

seamen are injured and when they can bring 

claims about what percentage of the time the 

person has to be connected to the vessel in 

order for them to be a seaman, and so I might 

look at that body of law.

There's a body of law under the Motor 

Carriers Act about how much a -- a company needs 

to be engaged in commerce to be subject to that 

act. 

So it's not an unusual question, and 

courts have tools to answer that question. It's 

also not a question that comes up much. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Can I ask you --

MS. BENNETT: Sure. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: -- about Saxon 

itself and also comments in your brief that it 

would make no sense to adopt the opposing side's 

view? 

Because, in Saxon, at oral argument, 

it was repeatedly stated to us, if we're talking 

about a company that is shipping its own goods, 

those people likely wouldn't have been railroad 

-- railroad employees or seamen at the time. 

"Not just Amazon...department stores, 

those people are likely not exempt...and here's 

why... There was a distinction that was made 

between railroads that shipped things for the 

public, and I think that's how we normally 

understood -- understand seamen and railroad 

employees and say a coal company's internal

And there's another -- there's more. 

"We have seamen and railroad employees, the two 

classes of workers that had preexisting dispute 

resolution statutes at the time and were 

commonly understood categories." 

"As a class, the seamen are the people 

who do the work of the shipping industry. As a 

class, railroad employees are people who do the 

work of the railroad industry." 

Now I bring that up not to bind 

anyone. I bring that up just because that was 

the common-sense understanding of counsel -- of 

Saxon, and it -- so it seems odd that you would 

read the Saxon opinion to have blown through 

those limits that were being stressed by counsel 

for Saxon about the implications of the 

position, number one. 

And it seems odd also to say the other 

side's position just makes no sense when --

given what was said at the oral argument in 

Saxon. So I just want to give you an 

opportunity to respond to that.

we don't read Saxon to decide the question 

presented here. I don't think --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Because I 

certainly didn't think that based on what 

happened at oral argument. 

MS. BENNETT: Sure. And I -- I 

think -- I think it leaves the question 

presented open, although I will say I think 

Flowers' argument is inconsistent with the 

reasoning of Saxon, which is we look at what 

these words meant in 1925, and we also are 

looking for a commonality between seamen and 

railroad employees, and if there isn't that 

commonality, we're not going to add an 

additional requirement. 

Now I think you asked about some 

answers to the hypotheticals in -- in Saxon. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Mm-hmm.

that this question wasn't presented either way 

in Saxon, and -- and there were some

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Well, I thought 

the answer was very clear actually. 

MS. BENNETT: Well, so -- so --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: It was reassuring, 

I think the word "narrow" was used, reassuring 

that the holding in favor of Saxon would be 

narrow and would not extend to industries other 

than the transportation industry, which that may 

be incorrect, but to call it like that makes no 

sense is a little much for me at least. 

MS. BENNETT: Sure. And I think the 

-- the gravamen -- you know, the -- there were 

specific predictions maybe, but the gravamen on 

that answer is to know whether the -- Federal 

Arbitration Act exempts a particular class of 

workers, what we'd have to do is go back and 

look in 1925 and see what these words meant. 

And we've now -- you know, because it wasn't the 

question presented in Saxon, that -- that 

research hadn't been done. We've now done that 

that. 

And I think it's very clear that in 

1925, the word "seamen" did not mean somebody 

who was employed by a company that sold 

transportation, and I -- I'd like to turn to

that briefly if -- if I may. 

You know, every source we have, when 

you go back and take a look, you've -- you've --

dictionaries, case law, books, statute -- other 

statutes, literally any piece of evidence we 

have confirms that the word "seamen" included 

anyone who worked aboard a vessel in furtherance 

of its purpose. It had nothing to with whether 

an employer sold transportation or in the Second 

Circuit's word had a particular price or revenue 

structure. 

And I'll note that this Court has 

already canvassed this history at least twice, 

you know, first in Wilander and then again in 

Saxon, and both times it came to the same 

conclusion, which is that "seaman" -- "seamen" 

rather is a longstanding, well-defined term that 

in 1925 plainly meant everybody who worked 

aboard a vessel. 

Now, to its credit, I actually don't 

take Flowers to dispute this ordinary meaning of 

"seamen." Maybe they'll get up and tell me I'm 

wrong about how I read their brief. But -- but 

what I take them to say is, you know, whatever 

the ordinary meaning is, for purposes of the

Federal Arbitration Act, the Court should give 

the word a different definition, and that 

different definition should be something like 

workers aboard a ship in a carrying trade 

carrying goods for trade and commerce. 

And -- and there are two problems, 

though, with this request. The first is not 

only is this not the ordinary meaning of 

"seamen" in 1925, it's not any meaning ever of 

"seamen" in 1925 or since then. What that 

definition comes from is a definition that a 

single district court gave to the term "merchant 

vessel," and the term "merchant vessel" is 

nowhere in the Federal Arbitration Act. 

So Flowers has to demonstrate a 

commonality between seamen and railroad 

employees, not between railroad employees and 

merchant vessels. So that's the first problem. 

It's just not in the statute. 

The second problem, though, is that 

even if this Court were willing to accept this 

definition of words that aren't even in the 

statute as the definition of "seamen" for 

purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act and 

define it in accordance with what Flowers says

we should define it, Flowers' drivers meet its 

own definition. There's no question that 

Flowers' truck drivers are engaged in 

transporting goods for commerce, just like the 

people on lumber boats in 1925, just like the 

people on the barges carrying railroad tie 

manufacturers' goods in this Court's decision in 

Ayer. 

And so, even if we were to accept 

every single one of Flowers' arguments on 

seamen, they still haven't shown that this 

employer-based industry requirement has anything 

to do with the words of the statute.

understand, what are the categories of seamen

things. One is we can mean the workers who are

shipping work. They do the work of the boat. 

Or you can mean sort of an employer-based 

requirement, which is they work for a company 

that sells transportation on Flowers' version. 

And -- and I think the intuition that 

seamen and railroad employees are definitely in 

the transportation industry is an intuition on 

the first question about individuals --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So assuming what I 

meant was the second. 

MS. BENNETT: Sure. Sure. A --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So who are the seamen 

who are not working for shippers? 

MS. BENNETT: There's a -- a bunch of 

them. So there are a bunch of manufacturers, 

for example, who employed seamen. There is -- a 

railroad tie manufacturer, for example, in Ayer 

employed seamen. There were lumber boats all up 

and down the West Coast that employed seamen. 

They worked for lumber companies. They didn't 

work for, you know, transportation companies. 

There were coal companies that employed seamen. 

The Ford Motor Company employed seamen. There's

Justice Kagan said, not in the shipping industry

shipping arbitration regime, or did it go to

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Right, but that --

I think that blends into my concern earlier that 

the linkage was, even if you have a slightly 

broader -- category of seamen than they say, 

they were covered by this separate arbitration 

regime, I think is what you're saying. 

MS. BENNETT: Some were and some were 

not. It would depend on the length of their 

voyage essentially.

it depended on whether they chose afterwards? 

MS. BENNETT: Yes. That's exactly 

right.

were covered by this statute would only go to 

arbitration if they chose to do so along with

regime? You said there are some seamen who 

wouldn't be. Who are they? 

MS. BENNETT: So anybody who was on a 

coasting voyage who did not sign their shipping 

articles in front of a shipping commissioner. 

So the lumber -- to take the lumber boat as an 

example, the lumber boat workers who had signed 

shipping articles before the shipping 

commissioner could have gone to shipping 

commissioner arbitration. Those who didn't 

could not. 

Anybody who wasn't on an ocean voyage. 

So anybody who was on a river or on a lake, 

those were certainly seamen. They could not 

have --

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Category --

categorically outside the arbitration provision? 

MS. BENNETT: Categorically outside 

because those voyages were only international, 

coast-to-coast, or coastwise. So anybody doing 

seamen's work in the internal parts of the 

United States. Anybody doing seamen's work that 

was local, that didn't go very far, so, for 

example, this Court's decision in Ellis talks 

about dredgers as being seamen.

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Got it. 

MS. BENNETT: Yeah. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Thank you. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: So, even if we 

reject the transportation industry test, we 

would still have to distinguish transportation 

workers from other workers, and you talked a 

little bit with Justice Sotomayor about that. 

Are you suggesting that we -- if we 

side with you in this case, that we take this 

opportunity to say more about that distinction, 

or do you think Saxon covers it? 

MS. BENNETT: I think Saxon covers it, 

and Saxon lays out a pretty clear test, which is 

workers that are directly involved in 

transporting goods across foreign or state 

borders. And -- and I'll note, since Saxon, the 

lower courts are pretty much agreed about what 

that means, and so I think, you know, if there 

is some further dispute that comes up, perhaps 

this Court may need to weigh in in that case, 

but I don't think this Court needs to do so 

here.

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Your friends on the 

other side make a -- a -- a large feature about 

some language in -- in Saxon, and I'm not sure 

you quite had a chance to address it yet, but 

seamen constituted a subset of workers engaged 

in the maritime shipping industry. Put aside 

history. How do you deal with that as a matter 

of precedent? 

MS. BENNETT: I think there are -- are 

two answers to that. One is -- and they're 

related. One is the argument that the Court was 

discussing there was just the argument that 

anybody who did the work of shipping would be 

exempt and would be a seaman. And -- what the 

Court was saying is not everybody who did the 

work of shipping was a seaman. What they were 

saying -- is -- what -- you know, the -- what --

people who are seamen are people who do the work 

of shipping on a boat.

JUSTICE GORSUCH: That's one. You 

said you had two. 

MS. BENNETT: The second is related, 

which is -- to the -- it's similar to the answer 

I was giving Justice Kagan earlier, which is 

what it means to be in an industry. So, for 

example, you know, Jones Day, certainly in the 

legal services industry. I don't think the head 

chef at the cafeteria of Jones Day would say 

that she is in the legal services industry. I 

think she'd say she's in the food services 

industry.

Thank you, counsel. 

MS. BENNETT: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Lovitt. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACI L. LOVITT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. LOVITT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

As counsel has made clear, Petitioners 

view the Section 1 exemption as encompassing any 

worker directly involved in a good's interstate 

journey, from the plant worker who loads goods 

for shipment to the store clerk who unloads them 

and shelves them. 

But, in Circuit City, this Court said 

that the Section 1 exemption should be read 

narrowly and should be interpreted with 

reference to the ejusdem canon, context, and 

history, all three of which demonstrate that the 

exemption is limited to transportation industry 

workers. 

After all, in 1925 -- Justice 

Kavanaugh is correct -- seamen and railroad 

employees were defined by the industry in which 

they work. And that commonality should carry

through to the residual clause. Context and 

history tell you why this line makes sense. 

By 1925, Congress knew that labor 

disputes involving transport -- transportation 

industry workers were different. They were 

unique. They could cause famines in Chicago. 

And in response, Congress passed two and only 

two federal arbitration statutes, one governing 

railroad employees in the rail industry and one 

governing seamen, who, under the Shipping 

Commissioners Act, were limited to those in the 

shipping industry. 

Petitioners can't provide a why for 

the enumeration. They can't explain why you 

would pair railroad employees and seamen 

together. And they advocate a definition of 

"seamen" that is so broad, it's flatly 

inconsistent with the notion of a transportation 

worker and this Court's holding in Circuit City. 

The result, a poor fit. And 

Petitioners show by example. Petitioners buy 

Flowers' bread. They pay Flowers for product. 

Then they take title to the bread, and it is 

only after they take title to the bread that 

they then move it intrastate in order to sell it

nothing like railroad employees or seamen. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: We -- we have looked 

at the performance of the workers in Saxon, and 

wouldn't it complicate matters now to look at 

the entire industry as the -- certainly, the 

district court did and -- and the Second Circuit 

did? 

MS. LOVITT: I -- I don't think so, 

Justice Thomas. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: And -- and don't you 

think -- I mean, I thought we foreclosed that. 

We said that we won't look. The argument --

part of the argument in Saxon was, well, she, 

Saxon, is in the -- in the transportation 

industry therefore. 

And as I hear -- you're saying, well, 

Petitioner here is not in the transportation 

industry therefore. And we foreclosed that, I

Thomas. The first was that you have to read

background fact that Ms. Saxon was an airline 

transportation industry worker. The Court 

presupposed that fact. And as Justice Kavanaugh 

read from the oral argument, that was accepted 

fact and part of the background on which the 

holding was made. 

The second point is the industry-wide 

holding, and in that part of the Court's 

opinion, the Court was rejecting Ms. Saxon's 

argument that it was sufficient for her to fall 

within the Section 1 exemption just because she 

was a transportation industry worker. 

And our argument is not that it's 

sufficient. We think that -- that you have to 

do the Saxon analysis, but the first question 

is, is being in the transportation industry 

necessary? 

And -- and -- and -- and the answer to 

that should be yes, because, you know, ever 

since 1972 in the Second Circuit, the background 

rule has been that you have to be in a 

transportation industry. That's the Erving 

decision that predates Circuit City and was on 

the winning side of the Circuit City split.

the transportation industry in order to be 

counted as a seaman. So how do you square your 

position with that? 

MS. LOVITT: So I -- first, I think 

Saxon in -- informs what it means to be a 

seaman, but -- but, Justice Jackson, I -- those 

cases aren't dealing with the limit here, which 

is you already have Circuit City, and Circuit 

City has already held that ejusdem -- because of 

the ejusdem canon, there are implied limits. 

And one of those implied limits is 

it's not a limitless seamen. It's the seamen 

who are transportation workers. And I think 

that's where Petitioners' definition gets in 

trouble because Petitioners freely admit that 

their seamen are pirates, they're enemy ship 

folks, they're on recreational boats. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: I understand that. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: But can I --

JUSTICE JACKSON: But -- but -- but --

have actors aboard a ship being counted as

Act cases, and --

JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, why does that 

matter when Congress was using the word "seamen" 

as I'm sure it was understood at the time that 

statute was passed? 

MS. LOVITT: Two reasons. The first 

is the Jones Act has a broad remedial purpose, 

and this Court has repeatedly recognized in the 

Jones Act context that it's reaching to the 

outer limit of seamen. 

The second is that there's no other 

federal statute that uses railroad employees and 

seamen together, and Circuit City says that that 

list has meaning and that list means that 

Section 1 seamen are different from other 

seamen. They share a commonality with railroad 

employees. And this Court held in Circuit City 

that that commonality is transportation worker. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

commonality can get very complicated, as your 

friend on the other side said. I mean, where 

did the price structure and revenue approach 

come from?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but 

where did it -- where did they get it? 

MS. LOVITT: I think the court was 

looking to characteristics of folks in the 

transportation industry and giving a more 

granular approach to what are common 

characteristics on the facts of this case. 

And, again, these facts aren't 

disputed. So there's for purposes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, but I 

mean they're not -- they're trying to figure out 

what the transportation industry is. 

MS. LOVITT: Mm-hmm. Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, again, 

I -- I think they just kind of made up, not -- I 

don't use that in a pejorative sense, maybe 

created this price structure and revenue 

approach, but it really imposes a -- a difficult 

burden and it would seem to me a lot of 

different results. I mean, you'd have conflict 

among the lower courts considering how that 

applies.

think are pretty compelling. I mean, is -- is

I'll --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry. 

MS. LOVITT: -- I'll try to keep track 

of them, but the -- the first -- the first 

question, which is about the Second Circuit's 

analysis, I think the Second Circuit was giving 

factors that were relevant to this case. 

I think the test is broader than that 

and it has been broader than that because, 

again, the background rule for -- at -- since at 

least 1972 in the Second Circuit has been you 

have to be in the transportation industry, and 

it's been a line between, are you hauling only 

your own stuff, or is part of your business 

hauling third-party goods as well? 

And that's a very clean line. Let's 

use your Amazon example. I think, in Amazon --

and, again, I don't -- I'm not Amazon's counsel, 

so I'm speaking as purely a consumer. As I 

understand Amazon, they're shipping not only the

question, which is sometimes they use FedEx, 

that's correct, but if FedEx -- if we had used 

FedEx, the defendant in this suit wouldn't be 

Flowers Foods. It would be FedEx because the 

contract of employment would be between FedEx 

and the worker. 

Why would Congress do that? That was 

your last question. I think that's the key

question. And there's a whole lot of reasons 

why Congress would do this. There's -- this 

is -- to us, Section 1, the exemption, is a 

wholesale policy judgment by Congress that 

transportation industry workers are different. 

And we know Congress is making 

wholesale judgments because it had put only two 

classes of workers in arbitration or had federal 

arbitration statutes, railroad employees and 

seamen, in the shipping industry. 

And why would Congress do that? 

Because, up to 1925, there had been many 

strikes, as Petitioners point out, but only 

strikes involving the transportation industry 

brought the country to a halt and caused famines 

in Chicago. And so Congress could reasonably 

say this is different. 

Today, we -- because the economy is 

different, we can think of all sorts of reasons 

why that policy judgment doesn't fit on the 

modern economy, but that doesn't make Congress's 

judgment in 1925 wrong.

If I agree with her about that, do you

MS. LOVITT: Well, I -- I would 

disagree with that, and -- and if I can answer 

that question first, then yours, Justice 

Barrett. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: Sure. 

MS. LOVITT: So in -- the Shipping 

Commissioners Act has two large restrictions. 

The first was in -- and I'm -- I'm citing the 

1925 version -- 46 U.S.C. Section 464 and 

Section 465. 

Section 464 says it's only voyage --

vessels that have voyages from the East Coast in 

the United States to the West Coast and from a 

port in the United States to a port overseas, 

not Canada. And then there's a second limit 

that you can't be earning a profit from the 

things that you're shipping. So you're not --

you're not making your money because you're 

shipping fish and you're selling the fish. 

You're making the money off the transportation. 

Those two limits boil down to the 

shipping industry, and here's where I think a

little bit of history of shipping helps a lot. 

The Panama Canal didn't open until 

1914, so to get from San Francisco to Boston in 

1914 was almost a nine-month journey. You don't 

take that journey and return with an empty ship. 

Those factors that are in the Shipping 

Commissioners Act are isolating the industry. 

And it makes sense because the people 

who need the arbitration remedy, the seamen who 

need the arbitration remedy are those who are 

going from port to port to port to port to port, 

going on a new vessel every time. They aren't 

the employees of -- of -- of a company that's 

making the same journey back and forth and 

they're regularly employed. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: Except you just 

pointed out reasons in the statute that limited. 

MS. LOVITT: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: So you're saying 

this wasn't just any seaman, it was seaman who 

met these particular restrictions. 

Well, Section 1 doesn't have that 

additional language. It just says seamen. So 

why wouldn't Section 1 be a broader subset of 

the narrower subset that you're talking about?

MS. LOVITT: Because, in both New 

Prime and in Circuit City, this Court recognized 

that the rich fabric upon which the Section 1 

exemption was passed was the fabric of the 

Shipping Commissioners Act and the Rail -- the 

Railway Act, and both of those were limited in 

effect to the shipping industry workers, and so 

it would have been unusual at the time to bring 

in all of these seamen who, again, Petitioners 

concede recreational boats are in. 

So, if you work on a yacht, you are --

and you never transport a good and you're just 

sightseeing with, you know, whoever owns the 

yacht, you're a seaman within the Section 1 

construct. That's not a transportation worker, 

and that's not what Congress was getting at. 

They were getting at that narrow subset of 

workers who actually impact the national 

commerce and national security. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: But why do those 

workers have to be in the industry? 

I mean, I can agree with you that the 

statute is about transportation workers and, in 

fact, we've held that. So we're not talking 

about -- I mean, maybe -- maybe I would disagree

with the representation that you just made about 

people who are working on a yacht. Maybe. 

But I think the line there is drawn 

between transportation worker and other workers. 

Both -- you can have transportation workers in a 

different kind of industry. That's why I don't 

understand where the industry limitation is 

coming from. That's not in the statute. 

MS. LOVITT: I -- I think it's coming 

from -- I think it is in the statute. I think 

it's falling out of the enumeration. And as 

Justice --

JUSTICE JACKSON: But the -- we've 

said the enumeration goes to transportation 

worker. Seamen, railroad workers. The other we 

say is limited by that to mean transportation 

workers. Got it. 

Where is the industry coming from? 

MS. LOVITT: So two points. First, in 

-- in Saxon, I think this Court correctly 

recognized that it's never given an exhaustive 

definition of "transportation worker." 

So the industry is coming out of the 

fact that in 1925, seamen were the seamen on 

these merchant ships that run the shipping

companies in 19 -- in the 1920s that had their 

own fleets or own boats or railroad companies or 

lumber companies that had railroad workers that 

-- that were their own, in-house? 

MS. LOVITT: They were almost always 

outside of the Shipping Commissioners Act 

because they were making these little local 

journeys that aren't falling within the 

arbitration provisions. 

And -- and a lot's been said -- if 

you'd indulge me for 30 seconds, a lot's been 

said about these lumber schooners. Petitioners 

actually don't have the history right on lumber 

schooners. Lumber schooners are a kind of boat 

and they were owned by syndicates. The 

syndicates included all people within the -- the

lumber, the people who were trading in lumber, 

the people who converted the lumber to 

two-by-fours, and people who made paper. And 

they had one -- and the master of the vessel. 

And they had one interest, which was to keep the 

vessel full. So, to the extent that they were

foreign or interstate commerce as understood at

that's where I see this argument. I just don't 

see it -- I mean, by the way, as an aside, 

Amazon, who's an amicus on your side, doesn't

brief, they say the focus is not on what the 

employee is doing as part of its duties --

employer is doing, but what -- what the industry 

is. And it says it's what the employee is 

doing. Their argument is, on what I'm saying 

your argument is, we have to look more carefully 

and more narrowly at what foreign or interstate 

commerce means.

the heart of that question, which is, is -- is 

the problem solved by last mile? And no, it's 

not, because, again, the background rule here 

until about 2020 was that the transportation 

industry workers were out, and that's why you're 

not seeing these cases arise until just the past 

year or so. 

And so the problem is you have a lot 

of companies who are -- are like -- I'm -- I'm 

just going to say Acme to keep it, you know, the 

record clean. You have Acme Company, who 

actually has their own drivers who cross state 

lines. That company doesn't see them -- they're 

not in the shipping industry in any -- in any 

way, and they're not preserved by the last mile. 

And so you start to introduce a whole 

class of cases. I mean, every -- in the modern 

economy, every retailer, every manufacturer has 

a shipping department, and those shipping 

departments are inevitably shipping goods in 

interstate commerce. 

And so you'd be -- in -- in light of 

the fact that the background rule excluded

honestly, if you look at Circuit City, it --

Circuit -- this -- cases that the Court affirmed 

in Circuit City, the court of appeals cases, 

were all assuming a transportation industry 

component. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: Ms. Lovitt, do we 

care -- it -- let's -- let's say we do care. I 

want to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's 

question. 

If you win, if we say there is an 

industry requirement, on the last mile -- if 

we've shifted our focus to the industry, does 

that go a long way toward settling the last mile 

driver question against you because then would 

we say, as long as you're a worker in the 

industry and the industry is engaged in 

interstate commerce, you get swept in? Or -- I 

understand it wouldn't resolve it, but would it 

make your argument harder? 

MS. LOVITT: No, I -- I don't think so 

because we're viewing the industry issue as a 

threshold issue. It's a necessary condition, 

not a sufficient one. So you'd still have the 

Saxon analysis. And the reason why that is 

important is because you're excluding a whole

involving manufacturers. 

You'd still need to decide the last 

mile question. And I think, for the good of the 

lower courts, it would be good to take one of 

those cases because that's an additional 

limitation, not an alternative limitation in our 

view and one that would -- again, I think it's 

important to deal with both preventing the wave 

of cases. And, again, Petitioner is not denying 

the fact that this is opening a whole new line 

of cases that, since even before the time of 

Circuit City, were viewed as off limits under 

Section 1. It's -- it's -- it's preventing that 

waterfall and cascade of cases.

was seamen who don't work for what we would call 

a maritime shipping company --

MS. LOVITT: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: -- fell into this 

gray area where they were covered by neither 

arbitration regime, I think was the theory, and

answer. Do you agree with that? 

MS. LOVITT: So just if I could 

restate the question to --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Yeah. Please do. 

MS. LOVITT: -- make sure I understand 

it correctly, is that there -- there were seamen 

who were outside the Shipping Commissioners Act 

or, you know, that -- that don't work in the 

shipping industry. That would be the leisure 

example, right, and the -- the recreational 

boats, the folks who are -- who -- who are on --

on lumber schooners that are just doing 

coastwise voyages, so they're doing -- and those 

are the traditional manufacturers. They would 

be outside of the Shipping Commissioners Act.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And on the -- on 

the rail industry, it's crystal -- well, 

"crystal clear" is a little strong, but it's 

clearer, right, that you had to be an employee 

of the railroad? 

MS. LOVITT: Yeah. We would use the 

word "crystal clear," but in -- in the -- in the 

federal arbitrations provisions governing 

railroad employees, you had to be an employer of 

the common carrier. 

And -- and then just to take it full 

circle to Saxon, I mean, the cases that this 

Court was citing in Saxon for the idea that a 

cargo loader was part of the -- part of 

interstate commerce, those are all rail common 

carrier cases. 

And the holding is, if you're a 

baggage handler on a railroad that's in the 

industry providing transportation services, 

you're clearly in.

You're bringing in the medical

because they need to get their products very 

quickly from one place to another. 

You're bringing in basically the 

entire food industry because, again, these 

point-to -- these point-to-sale shipments like

it. 

But let me just ask, on the other 

side, it may have been straightforward for the 

Second Circuit to apply its test to the facts of 

this case, but will it be straightforward in 

other cases? Will it not involve some very 

difficult line-drawing problems?

Justice Alito, in our view, it's not. 

Ninety-five percent of these cases, it's clear. 

The FedExes, the UPS, the Yellow Freights, the

industry because they're in the business of 

shipping other people's goods. 

And even there are companies like 

Amazon, who ship their own and other people's, 

but the usual course of their business is to 

include other people's goods. There -- you 

know, most companies -- I don't want to use the

has massively shifted and maybe those words mean 

the same thing, maybe they mean what Ms. Bennett 

says they do, but because of the way that 

industry and shipping has changed, no -- just 

kind of as an anachronism, it doesn't really 

make sense, and then wouldn't it be for Congress 

to fix it? 

MS. LOVITT: I -- I think Congress 

already fixed it. And because in -- when it 

enacted Section 1, there is a residual clause. 

Congress was anticipating that there were going 

to be other industries and that -- that would 

have the same kind of shipping element to them. 

And the airline industry, for example, was the 

very next stop. 

And they also now have an arbitration 

provision, which, by the way, to get to your 

question that you asked Petitioners' counsel, 

yes, this is still relevant because we still 

have massive arbitration regimes governing the 

rail industry and the air industry. And if you 

had the FAA coming in, and -- there'd -- there'd 

be a question over, you know, which one is 

preeminent.

new line of cases where people say -- where 

employers are saying, no, we're outside of that 

federal regime. We have a private contract, we 

enforce it under the FAA. So there is 

interference that could be done under the 

modern -- modern statutes. 

But I think, to get to your point, 

it's not an anachronism. I think what has 

changed is that in 1925, industries -- there --

there weren't big long haul, there really wasn't 

a -- a -- a -- an airline industry and there 

really wasn't an over-the-road trucking 

industry. That didn't really come until the 

1950s. And the way people shipped goods is by 

rail. 

And -- and if you were shipping or 

you're shipping long distances in the shipping 

industry in vessels. And so the Section 1 was 

really encompassing the entirety of the 

transportation industry while anticipating that 

the industry was also evolving and that Congress 

might want to get involved there too. 

And if I can just make one last point, 

I -- I think part of the issue here is too is 

there's not been any industry component and now

there's no industry requirement and you combine 

it with the holding in Saxon, it's not only that 

you bring in all of these, you know,

So why would the line be between big 

companies with in-house transportation arms 

versus those that use FedEx? 

MS. LOVITT: I'm glad you asked that 

question. And it's the word "presumably" 

because, if something -- in most labor disputes, 

if you have a labor dispute between the employer 

and their employees, the employer is best 

situated to deal with that dispute. 

The time when that's not true is when 

you have transportation industry workers because 

there are third-party effects that cascade for

again, all sorts of industry disputes, but it 

was only the rail industry dispute that brought 

Chicago to the point of famine, and that's when 

Congress had to intervene and --

JUSTICE JACKSON: Now I just thought 

that was because of the nature of the goods and 

the fact that they were crossing state lines and 

they were sort of intranational. And that's the 

same with Amazon and Walmart and U.S. Foods and 

companies that have internal transportation arms 

today.

take Flowers. If -- if Flowers can't ship its 

bread, that is -- that problem is best addressed 

between Flowers and -- and its employees, but it 

doesn't mean that the nation runs out of bread. 

It means that people are going to have to buy 

other bread for a little bit of time. 

And that's true whenever you're 

talking about a manufacturer. If it's a single 

manufacturer that has a problem, there are other 

manufacturers who aren't implicated. Where you

international and interstate shipping of goods 

and that -- and -- and that industry. 

And, again, we may come up with a lot 

of examples today where that doesn't make sense, 

but in 1925, that was the lesson that Congress 

had learned, and Congress responded by enacting 

arbitration provisions for only two members of 

the economy, two classes of workers, and they 

were both in the transportation industry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just want to 

make sure that the background principles, I've 

got them in my head right. 

MS. LOVITT: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: These contracts 

that these employees have with the employers 

could be enforceable in state court. If they 

require arbitration in state court, if you file 

a suit in state court or they file a suit in 

state court, those arbitration agreements have 

to be honored, correct?

took in the lower court, but there's a circuit

nothing to do with who employed those people. 

And that's the way every statute 

governing seamen worked in 1925. There were a 

bunch of statutes that have a bunch of different 

limitations, but all of them were very explicit 

about what they were, and not a single one was 

employer-based. 

And that's for the second -- to take 

the second reason, which is Flowers says, don't

get at people who could disrupt commerce, you 

know, the way strikes worked in 1925 is they 

weren't employer-based. Everybody who did the 

same job in the same location struck together, 

and that's why they were so disruptive. 

And so, if Congress was trying to get 

at that, they would not have included an 

employer-based limitation. I think that's why 

we don't see one in the statute. 

To Justice Alito's point about 

narrowness, I think you asked that I address 

that in rebuttal. Two points on that. One is 

it's not true that the background rule in the 

circuits has been this employer-based industry 

requirement. 

The Seventh Circuit decision in 

Kienstra I believe was a concrete company. The 

Ninth Circuit has decisions on Amazon. The 

First Circuit does. You know, I'm not aware of 

this requirement being true in any circuit until 

really the Second Circuit made this decision and 

the Eleventh Circuit had some decisions. 

But even in the Second Circuit, when

industry, what it said was a basketball player 

is not in the transportation industry. It 

wasn't saying anything about who the employer 

was. 

And -- and as the dissent in this case 

said in the Second Circuit, the well-established 

rule has been forever that if the residual 

clause covers anyone, it's truck drivers. And 

given that longstanding principle, I still 

haven't seen a single case where you have, you 

know, pizza delivery drivers or pest control 

workers or any of the people they're -- they're 

worried about, actually any court saying that 

they're exempt, despite the rule being 

ordinarily, no court has really looked at 

whether -- at this kind of employer-based test. 

And -- and -- and the other thing is, 

you know, they -- Flowers makes a big deal of 

railroad employees. There are almost no 

railroad employees today. Almost all of those 

jobs are truckers now. And so we're not making 

the exemption broader. We're just taking the 

people who would have been railroad employees 

and now they're truck drivers. And it so 

happens that trucking works just like maritime

shipping, which is that some companies use 

companies like FedEx, and some companies do what 

Flowers did, which is essentially bring a 

trucking company in-house themselves. There's 

no reason that those workers should be treated 

any differently. 

And the last point I want to make is 

just on administrability. Flowers hasn't 

explained how its test or how the Second 

Circuit's test would apply in this very case, 

and that's in two ways. One, there's no dispute 

here that Flowers sells transportation. The --

the retailers that Flowers sells to are not just 

buying bread; they're buying the bread showing 

up at their retail stores. It's not clear to me 

why, for that reason alone, those -- they --

they don't -- Flowers doesn't satisfy its own 

test. 

And the second point is Flowers 

actually has quite a complicated corporate 

structure. And the drivers here aren't 

contracting with Flowers. They're contracting 

with a subsidiary of Flowers that only handles 

transportation for other subsidiaries that make 

baked goods. So that subsidiary is only

transporting other people's goods. And Flowers 

doesn't explain why that too wouldn't satisfy 

its test. 

And what that shows is that its test, 

the employer-based industry test, is going to be 

really difficult to apply, and it's going to be 

difficult to apply even in cases that Flowers 

says, like this one, should be straightforward. 

They're not. 

And, again, this would have been a 

problem in 1925, just as it is today. You know, 

there were lumber companies that owned railroads 

that may or may not have shipped entirely the 

lumber company's goods. And it's not clear --

you know, Congress would have known in 1925 that 

that would have been difficult to apply, and 

there's no reason it would have included that 

requirement in the statute here. 

So, again, we ask that this Court 

reject Flowers' request to add this requirement 

that both has no basis in the text and would 

just make the statute harder to apply. 

Thank you.
