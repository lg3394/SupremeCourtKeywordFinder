 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-108,

 Snyder versus United States.

 Ms. Blatt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Section 666 applies to 19 million 

state, local, and tribal officials and anyone 

else whose employer receives federal benefits, 

including 14 million Medicare-funded healthcare 

workers.  Congress did not plausibly subject all 

of these people to 10 years in prison just for 

accepting gifts, especially when federal 

officials face only two years for accepting 

gifts under 201(c). 

666 punishes corruptly receiving 

anything of value intending to be influenced or 

rewarded.  "Corruptly [...] intending to be 

influenced"  covers classic bribes, where 

officials get upfront payments in exchange for 

official conduct, while "corruptly [...]

 intending to be rewarded"  covers bribes paid

 after the fact and to officials who aren't

 actually influenced.

 The government argues "corruptly"

 under 666 means wrongful, immoral, depraved, or

 evil. But the government tried this case and 

countless others on the theory that "corruptly"

 just meant knowingly.  Regardless, the 

government's new definition is implausible and 

stunningly vague. 

No gratuity statute -- that's none 

whatsoever -- uses the word "corruptly" and for 

good reason.  The government can't tell you what 

gifts are corrupts -- are corrupt.  What gift is 

too much for the doctor who saves your life?  Is 

pornography an immoral gift? 

The federalism and due process 

implications of the government's view are 

gobsmacking.  All states prohibit bribery, but 

localities and states take an -- infinite 

approaches to gifts and outside compensation. 

Affirmance would let federal 

prosecutors second-guess all of these judgments. 

Meanwhile, state and local officials will have 

no way of knowing what gift would subject them

to 10 years in prison.  Remember, extensive 

guidance tells federal employees that accepting 

anything over $20 is a crime.

 It would be downright Kafkaesque to 

subject state and local officials to a 

standardless and severe regime where federal

 interests are at their weakest.

 I welcome questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Blatt, if 

I find a lost pet and return it to the owner and 

the owner's grateful and gives me $10, that's a 

reward, right, even though nothing else happened 

in advance between the owner and -- and me? 

MS. BLATT: So, yes, divorced from, 

you know, a crime that makes it a corrupt --

corruptly giving something of value intending to 

be rewarded, the word "reward," just divorced 

from text of a statute, context, common sense at 

least in this case, sure, "reward" can mean both 

a bribery and -- a quid pro quo bribery and a 

gratuity. 

And we think it's very significant in 

all the statutes that use "reward" to mean 

gratuities, they're vastly different in four 

respects here.  They all say, when "reward" is

used to mean gratuities -- these are cited at

 page 31 of our brief.  They make clear that no 

quid pro quo payment is required. They say you

 can't receive any authorized fee or

 compensation. 

Also, there are 13 gratuity statutes

 identified in the brief.  Virtually all of them

 have no express mens rea whatsoever.  They have

 vastly lower penalties.  And they almost 

exclusively apply to federal officials.  And I 

think that just highlights that gratuity 

statutes are generally prophylactic rules where 

the government has a direct interest. 

And at least here, to use "corruptly" 

in a gratuity statute would make this statute a 

unicorn.  It literally has no accepted meaning. 

It doesn't exist in any other statute.  I don't 

think anyone knows what a corrupt gratuity is. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if -- if -- I -- I 

-- I would think that demanding mens rea would 

cut against you.  In other words, if you add in 

demanding mens rea to the statute, one will have 

less fear that the statute is going to be 

applied in an overbroad way.  So you're using 

that on your side, but I would think that it's

really the government's argument.

 MS. BLATT: No. Government -- mens 

rea can't help you if it's standardless and has

 no -- no meaning and just leaves it up to a jury

 and, I guess, federal prosecutors.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So your view is

 dependent on the vagueness of the standard?  If 

we just knew that it was a serious, a demanding 

mens rea standard, then it would cut for the 

government? 

MS. BLATT: No, it's not just that 

it's vague.  It's also unheard of and 

ahistorical.  And I just don't think the 

government's story holds up.  The government's 

story is, hey, in 1986, we had this gratuity 

language and we add the word "corruptly." 

But that, of course, is not true.  You 

had a statute that was identical to Section 

201(c) that was a gratuity statute.  And the 

government -- the Congress did not just sneak in 

the word "corrupt."  They deleted that statute 

in toto, hook, line, and sinker, and added 

"corruptly [...] intending to be influenced, 

rewarded" in a way that looks much more like the 

201(b) bribery statute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, I 

thought the original 666 covered gratuities, and 

what Congress then did is, instead of copying 

the bribery statute, 201(a), it decided to copy

 the gratuity statute, 201(c).

 So, if they intended bribery, why

 didn't they just copy the statute that meant

 bribery?

 MS. BLATT: So, in 1984, the statute 

read you can't give or accept anything for or 

because official conduct.  And that is the 

gratuity statute.  That language got deleted in 

toto. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that's 

the point.  Why not borrow then the language 

from 201(a) -- the -- from 201(b) -- I'm sorry 

-- instead --

MS. BLATT: 201(b). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- (b) instead of 

(c). I said (a), but I meant (b). 

MS. BLATT: And our point is it looks 

a lot like, more 201(b), which is -- has the 

"corruptly [...] intending to be influenced." 

And I just don't think the story is that adding

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they had that

 language, but they chose something broader and

 different.  And so I don't understand.

 MS. BLATT: I don't think it's broader 

at all, and let me see if I can be clear on

 this. 201(b) is very different. The Court in

 McDonnell had said you can actually be convicted 

if you don't have any intent to be influenced

 under bribery. 

But, under this statute, 666, the 

government has --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They didn't have 

McDonnell in front of them, so I don't know what 

that has to do with anything. 

MS. BLATT: Well, let me -- let --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They -- they had 

clear bribery language in 201(b), and, instead, 

they chose something closer to the gratuity 

language of 201(c). 

MS. BLATT: So it doesn't look 

anything like 201(c) and every -- nor any other 

gratuity statute in the U.S. Code, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Can I 

go to the disparity that you were talking about? 

MS. BLATT: Mm-hmm.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  666, when it was

 clearly a gratuity, had 10-year statute --

 penalty.  So it was always disparate from other 

statutes involving federal officers.

 So what do I take from that?

 MS. BLATT: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning you say 

that Congress couldn't have intended to treat

 state from federal officials differently.  But 

it always did. 

MS. BLATT: Well, all --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It did before it 

amended 666. 

MS. BLATT: I wouldn't consider two 

years always.  It was a short-lived statute that 

was immediately deleted.  So -- and I don't even 

know if the government had any prosecutions. 

But if I could just finish my answer 

on what I don't think the government has a 

response to, if a jury finds that a official was 

not influenced because he would have taken the 

same vote anyway, the jury has to acquit if the 

statute had just said "intending to be 

influenced."  And so "intending to be [...] 

rewarded" is absolutely critical in this

statute, and that is not the case of the federal

 bribery statute.  This statute actually requires 

either an intent to be influenced or an intent

 to be rewarded.

 The other thing I can say about the 

disparate penalties is that no other statute in 

the U.S. Code puts gratuity on par with bribery.

 And the government's -- under the government's 

view, you'd never ever have to either charge, 

much less prove, an intent to influence because, 

under their view, any payment that is an intent 

to reward under their reading renders any need 

to prove intent to influence completely 

superfluous, irrelevant, and unnecessary. 

And that is an outlier in -- in 

history and in the U.S. Code. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And it uses almost 

exactly the same language. It has "corrupt,"

 "corruptly."  It has giving, offering, promising

 "anything of value to [a] [...] person with

 [the] intent to influence or reward."  When I 

look at the legislative history of 215, it says 

-- or 666 says that it's modeled off of 215.

 And 215's legislative history says it includes

 gratuities. 

So I'm just trying to understand what 

you mean about this not looking like anything 

else. 

MS. BLATT: Of course. Let me take on 

Section -- Section 215.  So, you're -- you're 

right, the -- the -- the wording is quite 

identical, and the only court to address the 

issue has held 215 is a bribery statute. 

But, on the legislative history, to be 

sure, a footnote in the legislative history of 

Section 215 mentions that that statute applies 

to gratuity. 

But, if we're going to rely on 

legislative history, I'll take the footnote in 

the legislative history of Section 666 itself. 

When it references the Section 215 statute, it

 But now we're really going to be

 worrying over footnotes in legislative history,

 I'll -- I'll take ours.

 But the -- the other thing I would say 

about 215, which is extraordinary, is that there

 is a provision, I think it's 215(d), that says 

-- orders federal agencies to give guidance.

 So every federal agency has issued 

extensive guidance to bank officials.  There's 

massive guidance, of course, to federal 

officials.  There is no such guidance, and had 

the government issued guidance, it would just 

make the federalism implications all the more 

bizarre. 

So bank officials are told here's what 

you can and cannot do, and there's no --

entities that take federal funds -- and this 

would also channel into them -- apart from the 

pandemic money, are there other reasons to think 

that federal funds would pull private entities 

into this?

largest industries in this country.  It covers 

every nurse, doctor, orderly, anyone in the

horribles also apply to the bribery side of the 

statute? I mean, what strikes me about this 

statute is the number of people that it covers.

 But you can imagine all of your

 horribles being done on the bribery side.  You 

know, I give the orthodontist for my kids hockey

 tickets so that -- and we kind of -- it is a

 quid pro quo so that, you know, my kid gets the 

best appointment or something like that. 

I mean, you can imagine a whole lot of 

cases where, even though there's an explicit 

bribe, it also seems like, really, we're 

criminalizing that?  So I'm -- I'm just 

wondering whether the horribles only apply to 

gratuities, as opposed to there are horribles in 

this statute because of the kinds of people it 

applies to. 

MS. BLATT: No, they -- no, I 

disagree, Justice Kagan, for this reason. Under 

Section 201, there's a 15-year sentence for 

bribery.  Government hates to have to prove a 

quid pro quo.  And there's a two-year sentence 

for gratuity, where it's really easy to get a 

water bottle plus a mug and it's over $20. 

There's vast, vast difference.

The government -- if it's that no big

 deal, let the government just prove quid pro

 quo. Just let them.  It's -- it's much more

 damaging.  The government has a direct interest. 

If you have to prove there was an influence on

 your official conduct, at least the government 

says it impacts the federal program.

 Here, they have six different ways

 where they're defining "corrupt:" if it's not 

benign, if it was against the employer's rules, 

if it's against common sense rules, if you're 

conscious of wrongdoing, which I had no idea 

what it means, if it could skew your official 

decisionmaking.  It is very different to say --

and I do think the fact that all states prohibit 

bribery cold and not all states -- some 

employers in some localities allow gifts.

 MS. BLATT: JA-18 objects to the

 definition of "corruptly" on JA-28 by saying, 

very clearly laying out the sine qua non of 

bribery is that quid pro quo payment and the 

jury would have to convict if it only found a

 gratuity.

 What the government is trying to say 

is that we should have said something other than 

the way the government's prosecuted every other 

666 case on just a knowing theory, and they've 

said six different ways what that would look 

like. 

And if you charge -- again, I'm sure 

you will ask them what the jury should be 

charged what common sense ethical rules are.  I 

mean, the restaurant example alone, I don't know

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But -- but I'm going 

to ask you a little bit more about "corruptly"

 MS. BLATT: Okay.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and -- and the 

mens rea that you think it should import here, 

putting aside the jury instructions and the

 debate over forfeiture.

 You mentioned consciousness of 

wrongdoing, which the Court mentioned also in 

Arthur Andersen if I recall. 

MS. BLATT: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And that -- that 

suggests, I -- I think, that you have to know 

that it's unlawful.  It's one of those rare 

statutes --

MS. BLATT: And willful. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- where perhaps 

ignorance of the law is a defense, if you will. 

What do you think of that? 

MS. BLATT: So, no, that's some other 

case. "Corruptly" has a very, very specific 

definition with bribery.  It cannot possibly 

mean one thing for bribery and something else in 

this statute.  It clearly means quid pro quo.

"Bribery" has always had both common

 law, historic, 201.  "Corruptly" means quid pro 

quo in this context. I think, when you have

 Arthur Andersen, official proceedings, document 

destruction, what have you, "corruptly" can mean

 all kinds of things.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Blatt, it 

makes no sense what you're saying to me. Here's 

a case in which someone is -- that's the 

allegation -- demanding money, gets it basically 

for no services, spends his time giving two or 

three different reasons and services that he 

performed, which he didn't, and there's a series 

of meetings or phone calls, texts, et cetera, 

before the second contract is awarded between 

these people. 

At some point, can't a jury see that 

as a demand for payment for services? 

MS. BLATT: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you're giving 

no definition that would cover that kind of 

behavior. 

MS. BLATT: So, first of all --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I think 

that's different than the situation the Chief

 MS. BLATT: Yeah.  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I want half the

 MS. BLATT: -- it's none of the

 federal government's business if a local 

official is doing nothing wrong with state and 

local laws and complied with all local laws. 

Most of their brief has nothing to do with their

little bit ironic.  But their theory is of a --

okay.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And why doesn't the

 language cover -- I mean, I understand you --

we've -- we're all thinking about this in terms 

of gratuities, and that opens the door to all of

 the, you know, relatively benign examples that

 you bring up, you know, when someone's just sort 

of showing thanks for doing services.

 But the statute does not use the word 

"gratuities."  In fact, the statute uses 

terminology that's very similar to what Justice 

Sotomayor just said, right?  "Someone who 

corruptly solicits or demands" -- and I'm 

skipping here -- "anything of value [...], 

intending to be rewarded." 

MS. BLATT: And the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And that -- and 

those are the facts that the government is at 

least alleging in this case. 

MS. BLATT: And -- and "corruptly" is

"gratuity," and it's very familiar --

 "gratuity."  I'm just looking at the statute.

 Why is -- aren't the facts that the government 

alleges here fitting entirely with the 

statement, the text of this statute?

 MS. BLATT: Because the plain language 

of "reward" can mean bribes, and it has -- it

 has been used that --

JUSTICE JACKSON: And it can't mean

 after the fact seeking a payment in -- for 

something that you've done officially? 

MS. BLATT: "Rewarding" can plainly 

mean bribes to officials who aren't actually 

influenced.  You give me money and either you're 

never going to take the vote or you couldn't 

take it anyway.  It also applies to 

after-the-fact payments. 

And if I can just say one other thing 

because you say on reward about "corrupt," a 

thousand dollar bottle of wine. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, but that's a 

gratuity. 

MS. BLATT: A $2,000 bottle of wine.

if the person is demanding it as a result of 

something that they've done --

there are 13 gratuity statutes.  None of them 

are like this. They have no mens rea because

 they're just prophylactic bright-line rules, you 

can't get that compensation, which is why that 

is the federal rule.

 You get even a dollar, it is a crime

 regardless of mens rea.  And there are 11,000 

pages of guidance to make sure that when you're 

a federal employee you don't go to jail for two 

years. I don't know what every single person --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what is 

"rewarded" doing in this statute?  Because, 

basically, you've defined it as bribery.  And we 

have "intending to in" -- "to be influenced." 

So what is the work of "rewarded"? 

MS. BLATT: Two critical things.  And 

the government has a response -- it's not a good 

one -- on one of them. They have no response to 

my first point.  It takes the issue of timing 

and causation off the table, and where they 

don't have a response is on causation. 

The statute, if it just said 

"intending to be influenced," a jury would have 

to acquit if the jury found the person wasn't 

influenced.  Like a gun -- I don't know, take a

 pro-gun or an anti-gun person who says --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I don't understand

 that. It says "intending to be influenced."  It

 has -- it doesn't say you have to actually have

 been influenced.  So --

MS. BLATT: Well --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I mean, isn't a 

bribery you're intended to -- you're intending

 to be influenced?  Okay. 

MS. BLATT: No, if the jury -- if he 

says, I wasn't influenced, I would have taken 

the vote anyway, the jury would have to acquit. 

I wasn't influenced.  I didn't even intend to be 

influenced because I told my God, my wife, and 

my son that I was going to vote that way anyway. 

I had no intent to be influenced. 

And on -- our second one is after the 

fact. Now I agree you could stretch the English 

language, but I just think it refers to more 

naturally an upfront payment is -- before the 

vote is an intent to be influenced and I'll do 

it, and then after the vote is taken just more 

naturally refers to reward, which is what the 

Fifth and First Circuit found, was that it 

totally takes timing off the table.

 of quid pro quo.  And "intending to influence"

 timing of the payment or the -- the way you

what Congress can do to federalize state 

substantive criminal law here? 

MS. BLATT: Yeah.  So Sabri is 

definitely in the context of bribery, and so the 

question would be if the section -- sorry -- the 

1984 version just criminalized gratuities and 

said for or because of official act 10-year 

penalty, and you would have to -- that -- there, 

you would meet, I think, the Spending Clause 

clear statement and the clear statement under 

Bass to upset the federal/state balance, and you

have a pure Sabri question.

 I mean, it's tough.  I think what the

 government would say, the only thing they

 intimated in their brief is that sometimes the 

gift could be so bad, I don't know, a Ferrari,

 that it might skew your official decisionmaking.

 And the problem with that is they

 don't have an answer, what about the toy

 Ferrari?  I mean, so they still have the 

vagueness problem, but I think their argument 

would be, although it's way less, it's certainly 

much weaker than bribery.  I think their skewing 

is the way they would get around the sort of, I 

guess, whatever you call it, Spending Clause 

authority or Article I authority. 

But it was bribery.  It was definitely 

bribery was at issue --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In Sabri. 

MS. BLATT: -- with the campaign 

finance and with the connection with the federal 

program, was clearly a bribery quid pro quo. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And, here, we have a 

very different scenario with gratuities. And 

did Congress really -- did it clearly mean to 

displace all state law?

 work with the bank and make sure that, you know,

 second-guess the banking rules if we find them

 unreasonable, but they're supposed to at least 

work out ahead of time, but there's just --

 But Congress would not have intended 

to prohibit that same official from steering the

 garbage truck contracts to the company and after 

the fact going to them and saying: Okay, give

 me $15,000.

 MS. BLATT: Yeah.  And --

JUSTICE JACKSON: And I guess I don't 

understand how you have a statute that is 

rationally drawing a distinction between those 

two scenarios. 

MS. BLATT: Oh, Sun-Diamond, Justice 

Scalia goes on and on and on, like his -- one of 

his favorite cases ever, he just goes on and on 

about the big difference between a bribery, 

that's where you pay the money in exchange, and 

a gratuity, that the action is taken is after 

the fact.  201 made that distinction. 

And so the other thing I would say --

and you can ask the government -- the 

government's position does not depend on 

steering.  This could have been the best garbage 

track -- garbage truck contract in the history 

of the planet but didn't like the $10,000 or 

didn't like the type of gift.

They ask -- they say it's okay to give 

coffee and doughnuts to the police who work

 around the clock.  Well, what about the police

 who coerced a confession?  Is that corrupt?

 Same gift, same donut.

 The government's theory to the jury 

has nothing to do with the steering. It's just 

they want to do that to make, you know, the --

the client look bad.  It is simply you got 

something of value after the fact because it 

related to official conduct, which it doesn't 

depend on any misconduct at all by the official. 

And, again, Sun-Diamond is literally 

all about the difference, and even in

federal officials were protected because two

The federal government needs to ensure

 the money it appropriates to local governments 

for public benefits is allocated in a way that 

maximizes the benefits to its citizens, not the 

rewards for local officials.

 Congress therefore enacted Section 666 

to bar officials from corruptly accepting 

payments with the intent to be influenced or 

rewarded in connection with their official 

duties. 

Petitioner ask -- asks this Court to 

weaken Section 666's protection for the public 

fisc by holding that a person does not violate 

Section 666 when he corruptly solicits a payment 

with the intent to be rewarded unless he has 

also agreed to accept the reward beforehand. 

But that requirement of a beforehand-

agreement finds no basis in the statutory text. 

The plain meaning of "reward" readily covers a 

payment given in return for an official action 

or decision that is already complete. 

So a police chief who sends his 

officers to foil a burglary at a store and then 

demands the store owner pay him $10,000 for his 

officers' work, he acts with the intent to be

 rewarded. 

A safety inspector who issues a 

building permit for a dangerous project and then 

solicits a $30,000 payment acts with the intent

 to be rewarded.

 And a mayor who steers a contract for

 a particular business and then asks that 

business to pay him $13,000 for the contract 

acts with the intent to be rewarded, whether or 

not the contractor agreed to give him the reward 

before the contract closed. 

Petitioner's argument to the contrary 

ignores both the plain meaning of the term 

"rewarded" and the statutory history.  In 1984, 

Congress enacted a flat bar on the acceptance of 

bribes and gratuities.  It was modeled directly 

on the one in Section 201(c) that applies to 

federal employees. 

In 1986, Congress narrowed that bar to 

carve out a subset of only the most culpable 

gratuities by adding a corruptly mens rea and an 

express exception for bona fide salary and 

benefits paid in the ordinary course of 

business. 

Now Congress's textual fix worked.

Petitioners haven't pointed to any real-world 

examples of Section 666 prosecutions for the 

sort of innocuous gift-giving activity that

 occurs in the ordinary course of business, and 

I'm happy to explain why the -- the two examples 

in their reply brief really just aren't what

 they are describing.

 But the Court should therefore reject 

Petitioner's invitation to artificially narrow 

the reach of Section 666. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, under 

-- your theory, there are two offenses in 666, 

the gratuity and the bribery. And a gratuity is 

really just a bribery without a quid pro quo, 

right? 

MS. SINZDAK: So, first of all, 

there's a single offense, corruptly accepting a 

payment, and then there are two means of 

committing that offense, either intending to be 

influenced or intending to be rewarded. 

So it's -- it's one offense, the 

corrupt acceptance, and then two different 

means. And, you're right, there -- there --

they overlap a lot of times when you're

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't 

know if they overlap. It seems one is a lesser

 included offense than the other, right?

 Gratuity -- why isn't the bribery thing just

 surplusage?

 MS. SINZDAK: No --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you can 

-- you just show a gratuity and, as they say, 

it's just kind of bribery without the quid pro 

quo. That's all you need to show. 

MS. SINZDAK: No, there are going to 

be situations where somebody is going to accept 

a payment intending to be influenced without 

intending to be rewarded.  So that's going to 

happen.  When somebody accepts a bribe and says: 

Yes, this -- this $10,000, it's going to 

influence me in making this decision, but I 

haven't made up my mind yet, and maybe they turn 

to someone else and say, hey, you know, somebody 

else gave me $10,000 to influence me, sure, you 

know, $20,000 might push me in another 

direction.  At that point, the -- he -- the 

person gets $20,000 and does what the second 

person wanted.

Now, in the second situation, I think 

that is somebody who's both intending to be 

influenced and intending to be rewarded because

 they're going to do something for that $20,000.

 But, in the first situation, there is

 nothing to be rewarded.  So they aren't going to 

-- so they are intending to be influenced, but 

they haven't made a decision. They haven't

 taken an act.  So they aren't intending to be 

rewarded.

so for two reasons.  First of all, I don't think

contract and, hey, it sure would help if you put

have a few different payments happening with the 

intent to be influenced but not rewarded.

 But the second point is that I think 

this lesser included offense comes from the 

relationship between 201(b), which covers 

bribery for federal officials, and 201(c), which

 covers gratuities.

 And the 201(c) offense is a broader

 offense.  It's the for or because of language. 

There's no corruptly mens rea.  There's no 

express exception for bona fide comp -- salary 

and compensation.  So, there, I think it -- it 

actually can be described as a lesser included 

offense. 

But, here, it's not that all 

gratuities are covered within the rewarded 

because, of course, the other restrictions 

within Section 666 still apply.  So it has to be 

accepted corruptly, and we have the exception 

for --

 Andersen decide -- described "corruptly."  It 

said it has to be corrupt, so that means 

wrongful or evil or immoral. And there has --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  How about a $500

MS. SINZDAK: So I think it would be 

helpful to set out what the guidelines are going 

to be here because, when there's a corruptly 

mens rea, what you -- you usually see in the 

jury instructions, sometimes it says 

consciousness of wrongdoing, so you have to know 

that what you're doing is wrong, but sometimes 

what the jury instructions do is isolate what is 

actually wrongful, what is obviously wrongful 

about this conduct.

MS. SINZDAK: Okay.  I just want to 

make sure because I do think, for example, in

 Sun-Diamond, Justice Scalia said that requiring 

this connection with a particular act is going 

to eliminate innocuous gift-giving for federal

 officials --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But you can't --

MS. SINZDAK: -- who don't have --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I'm going to press 

on this. What is innocuous and what is not? 

And, just as important, how is the official 

supposed to know ahead of time, oh, the $100 

gift certificate's okay, but the larger one's 

not, or the set of books or the framed photo --

MS. SINZDAK: So, again --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- or --

MS. SINZDAK: -- I think there are 

three circumstances where the official is going 

to know that what he's doing is obviously 

wrongful. The first one is where he took the 

public act with the intent to be rewarded.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, you're 

collapsing two different things there.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's not my

 hypothetical.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  My hypothetical is 

the person, the official knew nothing about the 

potential for the gratuity after the fact. 

MS. SINZDAK: So that's going to make 

it harder for the government to prove corruptly, 

but there are two other circumstances --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why?  Why? 

MS. SINZDAK: Because corrupt --

because "corruptly" has to get at what's 

obviously wrongful in the statute, which is 

where you are performing public acts for private 

gain. So, if that's --

 So put aside the actus reus for a

 moment.  You say "corruptly" carries with it

 some mens rea.

 MS. SINZDAK: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What is it?

 MS. SINZDAK: Consciousness of

 wrongdoing. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So you think the

unlawful?

MS. SINZDAK: So, again, I think what 

we're talking about here is wrongful in the

immoral.  And sometimes that's when --

the statute is targeting is taking public acts

 for private gain.  So where, again -- and I'm 

just going to give you the three circumstances.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That -- that 

defeats your whole theory -- I'm sorry --

because, if the public act was done, completed,

 I've done -- we're done with the new zoning reg, 

we're done with the new school board decision, 

and then the gratuity, the gift, the thank you 

arrives, you're still going to prosecute those 

cases as corrupt under your theory of what 

"corruptly" means, correct? 

MS. SINZDAK: Where one of three 

circumstances is met. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So that means 

where you haven't taken the public action for 

private gain. 

MS. SINZDAK: No.  I think that's 

where the -- the -- the problem is coming in. 

So, here, for example, imagine that the official 

just knows that the Buha brothers, they pay big 

rewards to people who give them contracts.  So 

what he decides to do is award the contract to 

the Buha brothers.  Afterwards, he's going to

objection if we were trying to prosecute a --

 campaign contributions on a -- sorry -- bona

 fide campaign contributions on a pure gratuities

 theory.

 And -- and, sorry, if I could just get 

-- get back again to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how -- how --

how about this? I mean, this statute applies to 

more than government officials.  It applies to 

pretty much every hospital.  It applies to 

pretty much every university.  So let's say 

billionaire patient comes to a hospital and gets 

extra special treatment.  He gets appointments 

when nobody else would get it. He gets surgery 

scheduled when nobody else would.  And -- and 

it's all done because everybody knows he's a 

billionaire patient, and they're hoping that 

he'll give an eight-figure gift to the hospital. 

How about that?  Does that fit? 

MS. SINZDAK: So it needs to be -- we 

walk through the statutory requirements.  The 

pay -- they -- there needs to be the acceptance 

or the solicitation of money in connection with 

particular business or transactions.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No. I'm just saying

are very hopeful and -- that -- that he's going 

to recompense them for all the special 

consideration that they've given.  Does that fit

 MS. SINZDAK: Well, the hospital has

 to have consciousness of wrongdoing.  So it's

 what the hospital thinks that matters there,

 right? The hospital has to understand that in

 accepting that money, they're -- they are

 committing wrongdoing.  And -- and so --

           JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but there's a 

jury that's going to decide whether they're 

committing wrongdoing or not, and a jury might 

say that sounds pretty corrupt. 

And all I'm suggesting is that given 

that this -- that this statute applies not just 

to government officials but to pretty much, 

like, every important institution in America, I 

mean, that seems quite extraordinary that when 

you do stuff hoping, thinking it might earn you 

a -- a big gift, even if it's just for the 

institution, not to put in your own pocket, that 

-- that that would land you 10 years in prison? 

MS. SINZDAK: Let me say -- respond to 

that in two ways.  First of all, under Section 

201(c), the federal government officials are 

undisputedly bound by these sorts of 

requirements with no corruptly mens rea.

And in -- in -- in Sun-Diamond, this

 Court said that requiring a tight connection 

between the reward and specific -- and a 

specific official acts or, here, you would say

 specific business or -- business or transactions

 worth more than $5,000, that was going to

 eliminate many, many of these cases.

 And I don't think that we -- we

 haven't -- again, Petitioner isn't here pointing 

to a mountain of cases where this has gone 

horribly astray.  So Section 201(c) does it for 

government officials without the "corruptly." 

I'd also note -- and I think you were 

pointing this out earlier with the -- in the 

colloquy with Petitioner -- that it's not going 

to get us out of this problem to just graft on 

an a -- atextual beforehand agreement because 

all that has to happen is that that rich -- that 

rich patient says to the doctors and nurses, 

hey, if you treat me well, there's -- there's 

going to be a nice big gift for the hospital at 

the end.  And -- and then the -- the beforehand 

agreement requirement just isn't going to do 

anything.

yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you said

 the -- your friend on the other side hasn't 

pointed to a lot of examples in the real world.

 But we've had several cases where we've made the 

very clear point that we don't rely on the good 

faith of the prosecutors in deciding cases like 

this. 

MS. SINZDAK: That's right.  And in 

1986, neither did Congress with respect to local 

and public officials.  That's why it added the 

corruptly mens rea, which has to be proved to a 

jury, and that's why Congress added an express 

exception for bona fide salary for compensation 

in the ordinary course of business. 

So Congress really did confront all of 

the concerns that I think the Court is -- is 

reflecting today, and it said we recognize we do 

not want to just cover innocuous gift-giving 

activity.

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  There's no

 applicable -- the state has left the -- the 

regulation of gratuities to the municipalities.

 And a particular town has got 3,000 people,

 2,000 people, 1,000 people.  It has no rules

 about the gratuities that police officers can

 accept.

 MS. SINZDAK:  Look, if the police 

officer can come forward and say, I just had no 

idea this was wrongful because there were no 

applicable rules, there was no applicable state 

law, then the government isn't going to be able 

to prove consciousness of wrongdoing.

it was, and now -- an automatic safe harbor.

jury instruction -- what -- maybe this is a good 

way to say it. What is the exact wording of the 

jury instruction on "corruptly" in your view?

 MS. SINZDAK: So I think there's two

 different options.  One is to isolate what is

 obviously wrongful in the particular case. 

That's what happened here, right?

 So, in this case -- and let me -- I 

think this is a helpful way of seeing how it 

played out.  Petitioner was not saying:  Oh, 

it's -- I -- I didn't know it was wrongful to 

take a $13,000 payment.  What -- what Petitioner 

was saying is: Oh, I wasn't taking a $13,000 

reward, I was actually taking consulting fees. 

So the jury instructions here said: 

What the jury has to find is that the Petitioner 

understood that this was a reward.  So that's 

what separated the wrongful from the innocent 

conduct.  So that's one way of doing jury 

instructions, to look at a particular case and 

just say:  Okay, what would make accepting $8 

million for a hospital patient --

billionaires who come to hospitals and it's sort 

of understood generally that the development 

office is going to be notified and afterwards 

that person might, in fact, be asked to give a 

donation to the hospital that treated him so 

well, et cetera.  That's sort of standard 

practice. 

So, in a situation like that, I would 

think the government's position is that is not 

wrongful from the standpoint of corruption.  We 

could not prove consciousness of wrongdoing

 But, when you have a situation like

 this one, where it's not standard practice for a

 garbage -- a contract to be given to a 

particular company and then the company that

 received that contract to pay out money, $13,000 

for the officials who were involved, that 

doesn't happen very often.

 And so, when we're in that world, then 

perhaps we do have a dispute about whether or 

not there was wrongful behavior, consciousness 

of wrongdoing, et cetera.  But that's what 

separates all these other standard practice, the 

cookies, the gift cards, the whatever, that's

Not the donation to the hospital. 

Talk about something that's more unsavory.

use that guideline then that Justice Jackson is 

talking about about what's standard because 

graft could be standard or gratuities could be

 standard even in unsavory cases.

 MS. SINZDAK: So the government has 

the burden of proof. They need to prove that 

somebody acted corruptly with consciousness of

 wrongdoing.  I certainly agree with Justice 

Jackson that if a person knows that this kind of 

behavior is happening all the time, that's the 

evidence they're going to put in to make it a 

very difficult for the government to meet their 

burden of proof.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see the

 questions before us as twofold.  Does the

 language of -- of this 201(c) include a

 gratuity?  It's very hard for me to think

 otherwise because the language is pretty clear. 

So, if it's clear that it includes gratuity, a 

lot of these questions have to do with what kind 

of gratuity, and that's where I think my 

colleagues are focused on what does the word 

"corruptly" mean. 

And you are fighting their suggestion 

that if you limit it to accepting rewards that 

are unlawful -- I -- I think Justice Gorsuch 

said, "unlawful" defined how?  He would say 

under state law, I think. I don't want to be 

putting words into his mouth, but I think he 

would say unlawful by state law. 

But you want to broaden it. You want 

to say by ethical rules.  But assume we -- we 

put that aside. Can you live with yes, it 

includes gratuities but only if you define 

"corruptly" as being unlawful, the way that 

Andersen suggested that went a little more 

broadly?

 understanding of -- of unlawfulness, yes, 

absolutely. And let me answer that directly. 

Let me also say that I -- I -- I take your

 point, "rewarded" -- I think the reason we're

 talking about "corruptly" is because "rewarded" 

just very clearly does cover after-the-fact

 payments.  There is no beforehand-agreement

 requirement.

 And I think that to the extent there's 

a dispute about exactly how you would define 

"corruptly," that isn't before the Court because 

they did not object to the definition of 

"corruptly." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understand it's 

not before the Court, but it really is because, 

if -- if we -- if it's not defined that way, I 

think there's a sense of then "gratuity" has no 

meaning, that anyone that could -- it would be 

so vague that it would be impossible. 

MS. SINZDAK: It would just be the 

provision that applies to federal officials in 

Section 201(c), which doesn't have the corruptly 

mens rea. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

MS. SINZDAK: That's right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not sure I

 You said that it would be -- that

interpreted to mean unlawful under state law? 

Is that what you said? 

MS. SINZDAK: I said -- I think she 

asked whether we could live with a -- a -- a 

definition, and I said that understanding that 

it was unlawful is a definition I think that 

certainly would be preferable to carving out 

gratuities from the statute altogether. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if something is 

not unlawful under state law, then it cannot be 

prosecuted as a gratuity under 666? 

MS. SINZDAK: If the person -- the 

person needs to understand that what they're 

doing is wrongful.  I mean, this is why we do

good enough, it's not protective enough of city

 would certainly rather you graft on a limit that 

is still going to catch people who are, like

 Petitioner, taking large sums of money after 

they awarded a contract with every intent to get

 that -- large sums of money.

 I would certainly rather you accept --

leave some room for that as opposed to carving 

it out entirely. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  And to -- just 

to summarize so I understand where you are, you 

think that "corruptly" means moral -- immoral or 

wrongful, and it requires knowing, the person 

must know that what is being done is immoral or 

wrongful?

forbidden.  Again, I'm just -- to be honest, I'm 

quoting Arthur Andersen.  So I think, if you're

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- what the definition

 is.

 MS. SINZDAK: So what Arthur Andersen

 said is that "corrupt" needs to be wrongful, 

evil, immoral, and a consciousness of

 wrongdoing.  So that's it. That's what we're

 looking at.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  And where does 

-- where would one look to find the rules of 

wrongfulness and immorality that would be 

applied in that situation? 

MS. SINZDAK: Well, again, I think 

that the criminal laws are a great place to 

look, so where the conduct is obviously 

unlawful.  You can also look at ethical codes 

and regulations if you're not sure whether 

something is obviously wrongful. 

None of this was litigated in this 

case because, again, there was no dispute that 

accepting a $13,000 payment for having granted a 

contract was wrongful, which I think was what he 

was doing.

think we understand that.  But we didn't really

 correctly decided.  We took it to explore the

 meaning of this provision.

 Was the jury instruction here on

 "corruptly" correct?

 MS. SINZDAK: It was in the

 circumstances of this case because there was no

 dispute about whether accepting a reward was

 wrongful.  But, Justice Alia, that's what --

sorry, pardon me.  Justice Alito, that is 

precisely what I'm -- I'm trying to say.  You do 

have to look at the circumstances because you 

have to isolate what was wrongful. 

And, here, there was no dispute that 

taking $13,000 as a payment for having granted a 

contract was wrongful.  That's why Petitioner 

didn't object to the jury instructions.

have seen, there just hasn't really been room to

 argue that the person -- that the -- the

 acceptance of the payment wasn't wrongful

is taking money and then doing everything that 

you can to cover up the fact that you took the

 money as a reward.

consciousness of wrongdoing, right?

the others outside of the Seventh Circuit, the

 "corruptly" is defined as immoral or wrongful?

 MS. SINZDAK: So the Second Circuit, I 

believe, has instructions that ask about a 

wrongful purpose. And, of course, if the -- if

 the defendant thinks, look, I didn't know what 

-- that taking this reward was wrong, then he 

can ask for an instruction saying, I had no --

asking the jury to decide whether he understood 

that the -- taking the reward was wrong. 

So there can be that express request. 

And -- and -- and this is just -- I'm -- I'm 

just sort of taking a page from Arthur Andersen 

on all of this.  "Corruptly" is, I admit, a 

relatively unique -- or a unique mens rea, but 

it's one with a rich historical pedigree.  So 

it's not that the government is making up some 

new limit.  It's not that Congress in 1986, when 

it was trying to -- to eliminate innocuous 

gratuities, was doing something wild and crazy 

by saying, you know, we're going to use the 

corruptly mens rea because that is going to get

that what they're doing is wrongful, that when

because that person is grateful may not know

recipient of this reward.  So is that a defense?

consciousness of wrongdoing, so they need to

wrongful.  These are sort of obscure ethics

JUSTICE ALITO:  There's not going to 

be a conviction because the jury is going to be 

sympathetic to this fellow?

 MS. SINZDAK: No, because it's not

 going to fulfill the corruptly mens rea.  Again, 

I want to be clear because I think we get --

keep losing sight of this.  Section 201(c) bars 

for federal officials just accepting gratuities, 

and it has no corruptly mens rea. 

The corruptly mens rea is a break. 

It's a break that Congress put in as an extra 

help to make sure that people who are bound by 

Section 666 aren't going to be prosecuted for 

all of this innocuous conduct. 

So I think this idea that by putting 

in something to protect -- an extra protection 

for Section 66 -- people covered by Section 666, 

you could somehow render all the coverage of --

of gratuities totally vague and unclear, I mean, 

that just can't be right.

Thank you, counsel.

here was correct.  But I'm reading the Seventh

 Circuit opinion at page 580, and the court is 

talking about that it's recognizing the

 disparate penalties for gratuities between 

federal and state officers, and the difference

 is mitigated -- this is the court's words -- by 

the additional requirement in Section 666 that

 the reward be paid or received corruptly.

 And it defined "corruptly," i.e., with 

the knowledge that giving or receiving the award 

-- reward is forbidden. 

MS. SINZDAK: That's right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  But 

that wasn't part of the charge here. 

MS. SINZDAK: At 41A?  No, because, 

again, the Petitioner was not -- was not 

arguing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- so the 

charge wasn't correct.  It just was not the --

any error was not preserved to be --

 these -- the -- the just a pure charitable

 contribution. 

If you actually look at the facts of

 the cases that they're citing, I think one of 

them is from the Local 150, that's the Donegal

 prosecution, there's actually thousands and

 thousands of dollars and -- of payments of all

 different kinds.  That's actually on -- on 

Westlaw.  You can look at the facts.  They're 

quite dramatic.  So that's not just pure 

charitable contributions. 

Similarly, I think they refer to a 

building inspector case.  In that case, somebody 

was giving -- the building inspector was giving 

permits and then -- and then getting, again, 

large amounts of money from developers having 

given them that -- the permit, so I think we had

got to keep scot-free.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, you in your 

brief make the point that we have to interpret 

"rewarded" your way rather than your friend's 

way because, otherwise, we're going to have a 

superfluity problem. 

In a case we're going to hear in a 

couple of days, the government makes the 

opposite argument and says that -- I think it 

says overlap is not uncommon in criminal 

statutes, and, therefore, we -- superfluity

 Which is it?

 MS. SINZDAK: So I think that,

MS. SINZDAK: Let me explain to you

 why we are.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.

 MS. SINZDAK: So Congress added the

 term -- it added "intended to be influenced or

 rewarded" in 1986, so there, adding the 

"rewarded" to what would otherwise have been

 language closely top -- closely tracking Section

 201(b), they clearly were trying to add 

something to cover more, to cover additional 

material.  So, there, when we have Section 

201(b), which would be the example of what you 

would do if you wanted to cover only the type of 

quid pro quo bribery that Petitioner is talking 

about, they had that, but they didn't just take 

201(b) and plop it into Section 666. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I got it. 

MS. SINZDAK: Instead, they added 

"rewarded." 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, I -- I got 

it. I got it, okay? 

And earlier this term the government 

argued that it would defy common sense for 

Congress not to have required more serious 

sentences for more serious crimes in Pulsifer.

MS. SINZDAK: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And that -- that --

that argument prevailed. 

Here, you're suggesting that it makes

 sense for the more serious offense of bribery

 and the less -- lesser offense of receiving a 

gratuity to receive the same punishment. Can

 you -- can you reconcile that one for me?

 MS. SINZDAK: Of -- of course, the 

government looks first to the text, and we know 

that the text here says that the 10-year penalty 

it did in 1984 when Petitioner acknowledges that 

it undisputedly covered gratuities. 

But I -- I can give you a historical 

reason why I think we have that, you know, the 

two years under 1962 and the -- and the 10-year 

maximum --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That -- that wasn't 

-- that wasn't my question.  Why would -- why 

would both bribery and receipt of a gratuity 

have the same 10-year sentence here and we 

should ignore that, but we were supposed to take 

cognizance of that kind of issue just last 

month?

enacted as part of the 1984 Crime Control Act,

 which also enacted the sentencing guidelines. 

And so Congress was moving from a situation 

where, as it had in 201, it was specifying 

specific sentences for specific law -- for

 specific types of breaking of a law. So there's

 201(b).  It had the two-year maximum for that.

 In 1984, Congress is doing sentencing 

guidelines, so it's saying we're going to have, 

you know, a maximum, but we're not going to 

worry about that because we're going to have 

mandatory guidelines that are going to take care 

of this. And then, in fact, if you look, 

Section 666 is listed both --

Pulsifer, and you -- you said that wasn't enough

finish my point, if you look at the guidelines,

 guideline that applies to Section 666. Under 

the gratuity guidelines, people are not getting

 more than two-year sentences.  And Petitioner 

hasn't pointed to anywhere that has happened.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Last one.

 And it -- this is circling back to Justice

 Kagan. And, again, put aside the -- the

 question about "corruptly." 

It seems to me that -- that the major 

safeguard that you pointed to in that discussion 

was the $5,000 threshold.  Is that right?  The 

$10,000 threshold and the $5,000 threshold? 

MS. SINZDAK: I think the bona fide 

salary exception is pretty important. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Okay, got 

that. Okay. 

With respect to those thresholds, the 

government seems to have argued that they're 

satisfied pretty easily.  In connection with 

business of an organization, the government's 

argued that we can take account of the salary of 

police officers, which are obviously more than 

$5,000.  So, because a police department 

receives $10,000 and the police officer makes

because they were counting up how many salary

because of the appearance problem they present, 

government officials getting payments like that, 

or because they're suggestive of something more 

nefarious that might also be going on with 

respect to the government official.

widespread agreement on that, I think, and I 

certainly do as well agree on that.  I think

was a break on an otherwise broad statute and so 

it's a good thing here, right?

 And I accept that, but the problem is 

the word "corruptly" then creates enormous 

uncertainty and vagueness about where the line 

is drawn.  And so, when you have state and local 

officials who have one set of rules they think 

they're following, coupled with a vague federal 

line that they have no idea where that's drawn, 

and it's up to 10 years in prison, that's a 

problem. 

MS. SINZDAK: So I think, to -- to --

to alleviate that concern, it is consciousness 

of wrongdoing. So, if there's uncertainty -- if 

there's uncertainty about whether accepting that 

reward is wrongful, the government isn't going 

to be able to prove that the person had this 

consciousness of wrongdoing.  So I think --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, you nicely 

anticipated my next question, which is to drill

gratuities entirely? I mean, yes, I'm going to

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And knew that it 

was unlawful?  Because you've said consciousness 

of wrongdoing. 

MS. SINZDAK: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So consciousness 

of illegality.  In other words, this statute 

would be narrowed to a situation where it was 

unlawful under state or local law and you knew 

it was unlawful under state or local law to take 

that gratuity. That's your -- I mean --

 you there?

 MS. SINZDAK: -- then we just go to

 Section 201(c).

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That lends to the

 clarity point, and it's clear there.  But, here, 

when you put "corruptly" in, now you don't know 

where the line is.  You don't know if the 

concert tickets, the game tickets, the gift card 

to Starbucks, whatever, where is the line, and 

so there's vagueness.  That creates the problem 

that there is here.

say -- this is my last question. You said these 

fringe cases as compared to this case.  I -- I 

think the "fringe cases" are the everyday 

concern.

requirement of consciousness of wrongdoing.  So,

was wrongful because it was unclear, because

have a responsibility not to bring prosecutions 

that don't meet the statute.  And what I'm 

saying is that the statute prevents that kind of 

prosecution.  So it's a -- it's a -- it's a --

tell me how your backup position that you were 

just talking about with Justice Kavanaugh works 

for the private university or the private 

hospital employee that Justice Kagan was 

pointing out satisfies the grant amount.  And 

I'll say, you know, as Justice Gorsuch pointed 

out, I don't think that the nexus requirements 

or the $5,000 requirement does a whole lot of 

work and, you know, for the surgery, the 

employee's time, or the police officer's time 

working your case or the professor's time 

spending like -- trust me, tutoring is 

expensive.  I've paid a lot of tutoring bills.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  The hospitals, the

 universities, et cetera, they're going to have 

ethics rules. I don't know about the car

 dealerships.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But what I'm saying

 is, if local -- state and local government rules 

don't apply to them, where do you look for your 

backup position?  Is it like, you know, the 

university ethics rules, the hospital ethics 

rules? 

MS. SINZDAK: I -- I think where --

where I look is whether they had, you know -- I 

think the easiest thing is whether there would 

be concrete evidence that this was wrongful. 

So, yes, if their entity's rules barred the 

thing, then I think that's going to be pretty 

good evidence. 

If it's unclear, though, Justice 

Barrett, I just want to again tell you that 

there has to be a consciousness of wrongdoing. 

So, if there just was nowhere they could look 

and there was no way for them to know that

 show consciousness of wrongdoing and it can't

 prosecute in that case.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Can't show it? 

So -- but -- but -- but you're kind of sliding, 

I guess, into the not backup position but the 

immoral or this is unsavory or this is wrong?

 MS. SINZDAK: No, they need to show 

that the person understood that what they were 

doing was wrongful.  So, if they -- the 

government cannot show that what the person 

under -- that the person understood what they 

were doing was wrongful, was against the law is 

the easiest way to show that, but if they don't 

have any laws to point to, if they don't -- just 

don't have any -- anything that they can point 

to, then they're not going to be able to prove 

that the person would know, would understand 

that what they're doing is wrongful. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But, under your 

first order position, there wouldn't be anything 

to point to, right, because I thought your first 

order position -- like your backup is if it's 

proscribed by law.  But I thought your first

immoral, if people would know this is corrupt.

 MS. SINZDAK: So our -- our position

 is just -- just -- let me be clear, it's that 

the act has to be wrongful and the person has to

 have consciousness of wrongdoing.  That 

requirement of consciousness of wrongdoing, we

 recognize that.  That's not a backup position.

I'm saying that I thought your first order

place to look because you should know it's 

immoral, you should know it's wrong. 

MS. SINZDAK: I -- I think that the

 circumstances you're pointing to, the government

 isn't going to take that position. They're not 

going to be able to say that just because -- you

 know, that -- it has to be obviously wrongful 

because what they're saying is we don't have 

evidence to demonstrate that this specific 

person knew that what they were doing was

 wrongful.

 But this is something that is just so 

obviously inherently unlawful or unwrong --

sorry, not unlawful, I don't want to confuse 

things -- inherently wrongful that the person 

would be bound to know. 

And I agree with you that when it's 

something that is either permitted by ethics 

rules or it's just never governed by ethics 

rules, this isn't something that people even 

think about in the ethics world maybe because 

cookies are just so, you know, obvious, then 

there's just -- the government -- that -- that 

-- there isn't going to be that consciousness of 

wrongdoing. 

The government isn't going to be able 

to show and they're not -- and -- and, 

therefore, the statute does not cover that --

that person because they do not understand that

 it is wrongful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I'm just 

totally confused in a lot of ways because I -- I 

had understood this case to be about a totally

 different part of the statute.  I -- so -- I --

and by what I mean is that suddenly it seems as 

though it's becoming a vehicle to investigate 

the corruptly solicits or demands element as 

opposed to the influenced or rewarded element. 

And I read the question presented to 

be about reward, like what does reward mean. 

You know, the -- the Petitioner's statement of 

the question presented is whether 666 

criminalizes gratuities without any quid pro quo 

agreement to take those actions. 

So I thought we were looking at reward 

and determining whether or not you needed a quid 

pro quo.  But it sounds like there's a lot of 

concern about the "corruptly" element. 

So can I ask you, do we need to take a 

position on "corruptly" here to rule in your 

favor on the question presented in this case?

MS. SINZDAK: No.  To rule in our 

favor, you just have to look and say that

 "rewarded" obviously encompasses rewards that 

are accepted without a beforehand agreement.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And if 

we were going to think about "corruptly," I 

guess I'm trying to understand how this case on

 these facts even really presents that issue.

 I mean, I understand all of these 

hypotheticals about the blankets and the 

Starbucks and the -- you know, the -- the -- the 

gray areas around where people could say is this 

person really acting corruptly. 

But was there a dispute in this case 

that it was corrupt for this official to -- if 

he was taking a reward, to receive the $13,000 

under these circumstances? 

MS. SINZDAK: No.  And that's 

generally the way these cases go.  It's not 

someone saying I took a reward, but I thought it 

wasn't wrongful, so it's not someone disputing 

the consciousness of wrongdoing point.  It's 

someone saying I wasn't taking a reward, I was 

taking something for being friends. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And that's -- so

"corruptly," because he essentially conceded

MS. SINZDAK: Right.  He did not 

challenge the jury instructions on "corruptly," 

even though the district -- the district court 

had already rejected the request to narrow the 

statute to gratuities, so it's not true that he 

didn't protest the "corruptly" definition 

because he was trying to get to -- to get at it

doesn't contest the "corruptly" jury instruction

 here because he wasn't saying it's rightful to

 accept the payment.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  He wasn't in 

the gray area scenario where people could say --

MS. SINZDAK: Exactly. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- well, I thought

 this was right.  He wasn't doing that. 

All right. So final question.  With 

respect to the question I asked Ms. Blatt, if we 

hold constant the "corruptly" aspect of this, 

the demand aspect of this, we assume that's all 

met and now we're really just focusing on 

reward, "intended to be influenced or rewarded," 

could -- can you articulate why Congress would 

not have wanted "rewarded" to include these 

gratuities? 

In other words, it seems as though 

that element is equating bribes, quid pro quo 

bribes, with rewards, what I'm thinking of as 

gratuities in this context. 

If we agree with Petitioner, it sounds 

as though there -- Congress would have wanted to 

prohibit one and not the other, and I can't

figure out why that would be.

 MS. SINZDAK: I -- I can't either 

because, again, gratuities have long been 

recognized to be as corrupt as rewards in many 

circumstances. We have the bar on gratuities in

 our Constitution itself.  We have Blackstone

 saying that the acceptance of gratuities is --

is -- is -- is corrupt and that, you know, the 

Romans were wrong to permit it. 

We have Congress barring not just 

bribery but also the -- the acceptance of 

gratuities without the corruptly mens rea in 

Section 201.  So there's just no reason.  And --

and that's not because Congress was, like, an 

overly -- overly moral being in this respect. 

It's because it's the same harm. 

If there's a beforehand agreement in 

this case, it doesn't change anything because 

it's crystal-clear that what the -- the 

Petitioner was doing was taking a public act 

intending to get that reward. 

And -- and whether there's a 

beforehand agreement or not, the harm is, 

instead of doing the public act for the public 

good, he's doing the public act for his own --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 

I mean, at least we should get a 9-0 

remand because everything that we heard today 

was not charged to the jury.  It is truly, as a 

former government lawyer, baffling how someone 

could just say that it was not contested, that 

this was wrongful. 

No citation. Of course, it was 

contested.  The whole argument was this was a 

legitimate consulting agreement because local 

officials don't make any money. 

And just because the government says 

it at argument doesn't make it true, especially 

when they don't have a citation. There was no 

jury instruction.  And then, at times, I feel 

like we're in a Senate room drafting language.

She literally said, here's what the 

guidelines are going to look like going forward. 

What we're going to do is we're going to isolate

 wrongfulness, we're going to talk about if it 

appears for public sale and on and on and on, 

and then she said "consciousness of wrongdoing"

 36 times.

           "Consciousness of wrongdoing" has

 never appeared, and here's where, if we're going 

to look at text, guess what, "corruptly" applies 

to bribery.  It has to mean the same thing. 

Corruptly as a consciousness of wrongdoing has 

never been the mens rea for bribery. 

And so now every single prosecution 

for bribery, I guess a defendant is entitled to 

an instruction, "I didn't know what I was doing 

was wrongful.  I didn't know it was unlawful. 

My hospital said I could do this."  No. She 

wants a separate rule for "corruptly." 

And to say that it's not part of the 

case is absurd.  "Corruptly" means quid pro quo. 

Intending to be influenced and intending to be 

rewarded are parts of that quid pro quo. 

The other thing I just want to get to, 

and Justice Kavanaugh got on this, there is a

 statute that she -- the -- the statute applies 

to accepting. It also applies to anyone who

 gives. That's 666(a)(2).  So 300 million

 Americans are covered by this.  Anyone who gives 

a gift commits a crime if it's corrupt.

 Now that consciousness of wrongdoing 

has to apply to the person who goes to the car 

dealership or to the billionaire or the poor 

person who wants to give a toy -- a toy truck. 

And then she said, well, I guess it's 

standard practice and you have to ask for it and 

be for sale.  You see something, you say, you 

know, I like your water bottle, it's got that, 

you know, nice little Apple logo.  Here, take 

it. Gratuity, you just give your job away for 

sale. You literally said, you know, you want 

it, you can have it, or they asked for it. 

I mean, this is -- this is 

preposterous that this would go into inherently 

wrongful.  I still can't figure out what about 

escort services.  That seems not standard 

practice to give that to your university 

admissions.  But maybe a plaque would be?  Or 

maybe a crystal -- a crystal would be. There's 

just -- there's literally no guidance here.

And the real irony is at least the 

banking officials would have more guidance. 

This is just kind of made up as -- as like it 

sounds like in moot court they worked this out 

because it would sound good.

 The stuff on the lesser included and

 greater -- greater included was gibberish. It

 is a -- recognized in government manuals that 

this is a greater included offense. 

And she said, well, it only applies to 

"demand."  But the statute says "demand or 

agrees to accept."  So, if you agree to accept 

something, you don't have to demand.  That's 

clearly a bribery.  There is no set of 

circumstances where, if you've proved -- proved 

a reward, you would ever need to prove a 

bribery.  And that's why the government manual 

says go for -- go for broke, go for both. All 

you need to do is prove one, and you'll at least 

get, at least in the federal officials, a 

two-year conviction. Here, you get a 10-year 

conviction.  The government sought six years 

here. We showed examples where they've -- they 

prosecuted for four years.

 line-drawing, I don't know why "can I get a ride 

in the Uber" would not count because that's

 asking for, you know, part of -- part of a -- a 

value. And this definition of consciousness of

 wrongdoing, I don't think it gives anybody any

 guidance whatsoever about what happens day in

 and day out.  So at least we get a remand.

 And -- and, Justice Sotomayor, on the 

harmless error under Nader, I'm not sure why she 

said evidence sufficiency.  The standard is 

beyond a reasonable doubt.  They'd have to show 

the jury instruction, and so there would have to 

be overwhelming evidence of bribery.  And so 

that would have to be worked on a remand.  But 

none of this was in the jury instruction. It 

was adequately yelling to the -- the top of the 

roof that this could only apply to gratuity, 

i.e., gratuities were not wrongful. 

Thank you.
