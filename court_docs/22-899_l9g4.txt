 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-899, Smith

 versus Arizona. 

Mr. Santhanam.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARI SANTHANAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SANTHANAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Jason Smith was denied his Sixth 

Amendment confrontation right when the State 

used a substitute expert, Gregory Longoni, to 

convey the out-of-court testimonial statements 

of the witness who actually analyzed the 

evidence in his case, Elizabeth Rast.  Longoni 

had no personal knowledge of the testing that 

Rast performed.  And -- and in terms of what 

Rast did, Longoni -- Longoni had no personal 

knowledge of what Rast did in terms of her 

testing. 

But what he did do was he conveyed 

Rast's statements from her own documents, from 

her report and notes, where he conveyed 

specifically the tests that she performed, the

 specific items that she tested, the procedures 

that she used. And when he purported to give

 his own opinions, Longoni was actually reciting 

verbatim the same statements that Rast made in 

her report to set forth her conclusions.

 Rast's statements were testimonial 

because any reasonable, objective person would 

understand that she prepared those statements 

for the primary purpose of creating evidence to 

use against Smith in his prosecution.  The 

State's request in this case at Pet. App. 127a 

specifically identified Smith, the charges 

against him, that trial had been set in his 

case, and as the record shows at Pet. App. 99a, 

the -- the State's attorney actually coordinated 

with Rast on her testing. 

And it is no wonder that in this case 

that the United States agrees that the judgment 

below cannot stand. 

The court of appeals nonetheless found 

that Longoni's testimony was permissible, and it 

did so applying the legal fiction that an expert 

may state the basis for his underlying 

conclusions and opinions under Rule 703 without 

offering that basis for the truth.

That legal fiction, as this -- as the 

plurality in this Court recognized in Williams, 

is unrealistic. It's unrealistic to expect that 

a jury such as Smith would understand that 

fiction. And, in this case, for the jury to 

have understood what Longoni's opinions were and 

to have evaluated those opinions, it necessarily 

had to have considered the truth of those 

underlying statements that were offered to 

support them. 

The State here made a strategic choice 

to make Rast a witness against Smith, and in 

doing so, it -- it elicited Rast's statements 

from -- through Longoni, and when it did so, it 

was required to present Rast for 

cross-examination. Its failure to do so 

violated Smith's confrontation right. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Would you take a step 

back and explain why you, first, think that this 

is -- that the -- is -- is testimonial and, two, 

how is it different from what -- the report in 

Williams? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  Sure.  Rast's 

statements here are testimonial because any

 reasonable, objective person would understand 

that they were prepared for the primary and --

and indeed, sole, exclusive purpose of creating

 evidence for Smith's prosecution.

 Again, that -- that's -- that's set 

out from the State's initial request identifying

 Rast, the charges against him, that trial had

 been set, she coordinated with the State's

 attorney, and it was all generated through a 

formalized process in which she prepared notes 

and a report all on typewritten DPS letterhead 

bearing the seal of the DPS.  And -- and it 

bears emphasis that these are documents that 

were served as part of discovery in this case, 

you know, to prove the facts that the 

prosecution was going to put on. 

So all of those circumstances meet the 

primary evidentiary purpose test, they meet the 

targeted individual test, and they also meet any 

requirement of solemnity that's required of 

Rast. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If we're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I was 

just going to ask, why isn't it enough for the 

defense counsel to be able to ask Longoni about

what happened in the lab?  And he's going to 

have to say, you know, I don't know. Well, then 

you're just relying on, you know, what something 

-- somebody told you, right?  Well, on -- what

 basis do you have for that?  You -- you say 

you're relying on, you know, this particular

 type of test.  How do you know that was done?

 How long -- how do -- do you know how long that 

was kept in whatever? 

In other words, it seems to me that 

there is a -- it's a two-edged sword.  I mean, 

you put somebody up there like Longoni, whose 

knowledge is very limited.  It -- he seems that 

he's ripe for cross-examination. It could be 

pretty effective. 

MR. SANTHANAM:  Right. So there's a 

-- yeah, Mr. Chief Justice, to answer your --

your question, this is not a scenario where the 

State put on Longoni to testify about data that 

he reviewed in the abstract, that, you know --

and that would have been fine. There are a lot 

of things that -- that the State could have done 

here that would have been fine.  They could have

 But, at the end of the day, what they

 could have done was simply had Longoni take the 

stand and testify that I reviewed certain data 

in the abstract and that is consistent with

 certain illicit substances. 

What the State couldn't do through

 Rast -- through Longoni was to say recount 

Rast's statements that I -- that she performed 

certain tests on specific evidence in Smith's 

case.  Those came from her testimonial 

documents, and that's what implicates the 

confrontation issue here. 

So the -- we're not suggesting that a 

expert witness cannot rely on others.  It's the 

moment when they introduce the testimonial 

statement of someone else where the 

confrontation right is implicated.

brief and in your introductory statement this 

morning, you've gone out of your way to trash

 Rule 703.  I mean, you just -- what are you

 trying to do?

           MR. SANTHANAM: Well, under Rule

 703 -- I think Rule 703, Justice Alito, operates 

in conjunction or in parallel with the Sixth

 Amendment.  Rule 703, you know, it's -- as a

 rule of evidence, it can prohibit certain 

evidence, and if you pass the hurdle in Rule 

703, when you deal with testimonial statements, 

you have to pass the higher burdle -- burden of 

the Sixth Amendment confrontation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, of course.  But 

703 does not provide that the facts on which an 

expert relies in reaching his or her expert 

opinion are put before the trier of fact for the 

truth of the matter asserted.  Isn't that 

correct? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  We disagree with that. 

Logic tells us, commentators, jurists, legal 

treatises all tell us, that when you put forth 

an expert's underlying statements that are 

offered -- on which the expert bases an opinion 

and the -- those statements can only support the

you're necessarily offering those statements for

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, okay.  Well, I 

understood you in your introductory statement to 

retreat from that, so that's what I want to

 pursue.

 You can win this case if you establish 

that Rast's notes were intro -- were testimonial 

and introduced -- therefore, introduced for the 

truth of the matter asserted.  You don't have to 

take -- you don't have to take out Rule 703 in 

order to do that. 

Now suppose Longoni had testified in 

the old style by answering a hypothetical 

question, which is what I understood you to talk 

about before. 

Would there be a Confrontation Clause 

problem there? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  If it was simply he 

was asked to assume certain facts before 

providing his opinion, we don't think there 

would be a confrontation violation.  And --

 kind of mind-boggling.  There was no request for 

an instruction to the jury that they should not

 accept Rast's statements -- the information in 

Rast's reports or notes for the truth of the 

matter asserted, right? There was no request

 for that?

 MR. SANTHANAM:  That's correct, 

Justice Alito, but our position is that there 

was no need for it because, in this case, the --

when you get to an instruction --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I understand. 

But, really, I don't understand why competent 

defense counsel wouldn't at least do that. 

There was not a request for a judgment of 

acquittal on the ground that there was no 

competent evidence to show that the substances 

that your client possessed were controlled 

substances. 

MR. SANTHANAM:  There was a judgment, 

a motion for a judgment of acquittal. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, on other 

grounds.  All right.  Let me get to the step 2, 

beyond the hypothetical.

 And I think there's a -- to -- a -- to 

kind of explain that, if we look at the delta 

between a scenario where the expert offers an 

opinion based on a hypothetical set of facts and

 what occurred here, which is where Longoni 

specifically stated Rast did certain things,

 reached certain results, used certain

 procedures, the delta between that is the truth 

of the statements. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I understand 

that. But get back to my bench trial.  You --

you don't believe the trial judge?  The trial 

judge says, I'm not going to consider this for 

the truth of the matter asserted.  If you 

Ms. Prosecutor, Mr. Prosecutor, want to prove 

that this was meth or marijuana, you're going to 

have to produce other evidence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so we've now

 very -- strayed very far.  I -- I take your

 point in your brief that the Confrontation

 Clause under anybody's theory on the bench 

that's been articulated previously, if -- if she 

-- if the lab technician had written an 

affidavit, I swear under the penalties of 

perjury that I did X, Y, and Z tests, that these 

were the results, these are my notes, I attach 

them hereto, and the expert got up and read that 

affidavit without saying, I hereby say, that 

that would be a clear Confrontation Clause 

violation? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  Yes.  That's -- that's 

the Court's holdings in Melendez-Diaz and 

Bullcoming. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So the 

fiction of 703 that somehow you read somebody 

else's notes, procedures, conclusions -- I think

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- they gave the

 MR. SANTHANAM:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because, once you 

just give someone else's testimony and it is the 

only basis for your opinion, then it's really 

you being a conduit. 

It's the policeman getting up at the 

Star Chamber and reading your notes and saying: 

This guy is guilty because of that.  Put this 

guy away because he did all these things. 

That's what a policeman did in the 

Star Chamber, right? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  That -- that's 

correct, Justice Sotomayor.  And -- and to -- to

 Now, under this Court's precedent, it 

would be a violation of the confrontation right

 if the report were introduced without

 confrontation.  It would be a confrontation 

violation if the notes are introduced without

 confrontation.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why would that be? 

Let's imagine that he takes the notes, but he 

never actually produces the affidavit.  I -- I 

think it depends how close -- I mean, if -- if 

you stretch out primary purpose tests too far, 

then it covers every antecedent. 

I mean, if he's just taking notes, 

like window was open, footprint was outside, I 

mean, that's not created as a substitute for 

trial testimony anyway. 

MR. SANTHANAM:  Well, a -- a couple of 

answers, Justice Barrett.  In that hypothetical 

of the police officer, we would also submit that 

if a second police officer took the stand and --

and recited statements from the notes, that too 

would be improper.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  He jots it down for

thinks about who he's going to target, he wants

looked like.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why shouldn't we

 adopt that test was the first question.

 MR. SANTHANAM:  Because I think it 

strikes too narrowly. It would preclude the

 Sixth Amendment from applying to a vast swath of

 the types of problems that -- inspired the 

Confrontation Clause to begin with.  It -- it 

would -- it would provide a means for 

prosecutors to come up with ways to introduce 

statements simply by making things less formal, 

and they -- you know, they don't necessarily 

have to do it in a way that is deceptive. They 

could enter -- enact policies where everything 

is done instead of just --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It seems like it 

would be more predictable, more easily applied 

and, therefore, helpful in that respect.  Do you 

agree with that? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  It -- it certainly 

would draw brighter lines.  I -- I -- I agree 

with that. But, at the end of the day, it

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And under that 

test, suppose that test, why do you win here?

 MR. SANTHANAM:  Right. In the -- in 

this case, the notes, the report, however you 

want to consider them, they were created as part 

of a formalized process, a formalized dialogue,

 if you may.  The prosecuting attorney, the 

State's attorney, coordinated with Rast on her 

testing.  She prepared her statements as part of 

a formalized process at a crime lab that 

resulted in her typewriting nine pages of 

reports, three pages -- of -- of notes, three 

pages of a report, all on DPS letterhead.  These 

things were served.  These weren't handwritten 

notes on scrap pieces of paper.  They were 

served as part of discovery in this case to 

prove facts. 

All of those circumstances together 

reflect a level of formality and solemn --

solemnity that we feel meets the -- the --

whatever tests members of this Court have --

Bullcoming, which Justice Thomas signed onto, it 

was signed, even though it wasn't an affidavit

MR. SANTHANAM:  The report was signed. 

That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 Justice Thomas, anything further?

 Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just to follow 

up on your answer to something that Justice 

Sotomayor asked, I thought that when -- when we 

finished our little questioning that you -- you 

were saying that Rule 403 -- I'm sorry -- 703 

created a problem under the Confrontation 

Clause, but do you want to go further than that 

and say that experts not only can't answer 

hypothetical questions but also that they can't 

take into account any facts that are not proved 

at trial in their presence? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  I -- I -- I don't 

think we would go that far.  So I -- I think, 

under Rule 703, a hypothetical question is fine 

so long as you're not saying -- reciting Rast's 

statements that I did X, got X, Y -- Y results.

I think that's fine.

 Where, again, the problem arises is

 when someone like Longoni takes the stand and --

and provides those statements.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  So, you're not 

making the argument that that's what the common 

-- that was the state of the common law in 1791 

and, therefore, that's what the Confrontation

 Clause incorporates?  You're not making that 

argument? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  We're not making that 

argument, but also we --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay. 

MR. SANTHANAM:  -- we ought to be 

mindful that the notion that you can introduce a 

statement through an expert under Rule 703 also 

wasn't around at the time. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Sotomayor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's a circuit

what test exists for an out-of-court statement 

to be testimonial.  That's Justice Thomas's 

position and the one that Justice Kavanaugh

 signed, sworn how and signed, et cetera, et

 Here, I understand Arizona conceded

 that. I know in its brief it raises that

 question.  But the Question Presented, 

everything, centers around that concession that 

it was testimonial, right?

 MR. SANTHANAM:  Well, the seat of 

Arizona, the State did not challenge whether any 

of these statements were testimonial in the 

proceedings below.  That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the question 

before us is whether, under the facts of this 

case, the statements were offered for the truth? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a separate 

question, and that's the second part of the 

split among the circuits, right? 

MR. SANTHANAM:  It -- it -- it -- that 

is correct, Justice Sotomayor.  And, you know,

MR. SANTHANAM:  So I -- we respond

 with, you know, that there are three significant

 practical limitations on the confrontation right 

that would prevent the sorts of outreach that 

the State and the United States complain of.

 The first is that you have to deal

 with statements.  Most of what experts deal with 

are physical evidence, photographs, things found

 at a crime scene.  And we're not suggesting that 

an expert can't rely on that simply because 

someone else collected that physical evidence. 

The second is, is that the -- even if 

a statement is involved, it has to be 

testimonial.  So, as this Court has recognized 

in Melendez-Diaz, Bullcoming, statements that 

are made in a hospital context, for example, for 

treatment purposes aren't testimonial. 

Similarly, most statements in a -- in the course 

of a business that isn't directed to generating 

evidence isn't going to be testimonial.  And 

experts can rely on all of that. 

And then, third, I think very 

critically, the State, the prosecution does not 

have to put on every statement to prove its 

case. And to kind of provide an example here

with this case, what -- you know, again, what

 the State could have done was simply have 

Longoni testify in a hypothetical, abstract 

fashion that he reviewed certain data and that's

 consistent with the -- the findings of -- that

 this is a illicit drug.

 But they went further than that.  They 

had Longoni actually recount, recite statements 

saying Rast did X, she used Y procedures, and 

she reached Z results.  And that, in our sense, 

underscores the truth of the matter asserted. 

That is the reason that they are presenting it, 

because without --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And is it your 

position as well that that really raises the 

Confrontation Clause problem?  Because to what 

extent could a defendant actually challenge 

those statements --

MR. SANTHANAM:  That is --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- that she did X or 

Y, because the person who's testifying did --

doesn't know.  He's just looking at the report 

that says that. 

MR. SANTHANAM:  That -- that's 

correct, Justice Jackson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

 MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

We agree with Petitioner that 

Longoni's testimony here may have gone too far. 

Our principal interest is in making clear that 

careful application of the federal rules can 

avoid confrontation concerns. 

Two main points on that.  Number one 

is that there's no confrontation problem when an 

expert comes up and testifies to the expert's 

bare fact of the bottom-line conclusion that the 

expert's drawn, like these are drugs.  The 

problem comes in when evidence surrounding that 

so-called basis evidence or methodology evidence 

comes in. 

The second point is that methodology

 appropriate cases.

 It's a little bit hard for me to tell, 

admittedly, but I think Petitioner largely 

agrees with us on the first point and to some

 degree on the second point.  So I think the

 Court can resolve this case narrowly without 

suggesting that we need Justice Pryor --

 Breyer's parade of 13 witnesses every time we 

want to introduce a DNA match. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you think that 

Ms. Rast's notes are testimonial? 

MR. FEIGIN: So I -- I'd like to --

Justice Thomas, I think it's very important 

there to break this into pieces. There are 

actually three different pieces of Rast's 

materials in the appendix, and we think that you 

could potentially go different directions with 

each of them, and they kind of match how we do 

it in the federal system as well. 

So there is an attested report on --

or a close to, you know, signed report on 

stationery that's three pages long.  That may 

well be testimonial. 

There are some further lab notes about 

that -- they aren't quite notes, but they're a

 little more data about what the material -- how 

the material was tested and so forth. Those may 

or may not be testimonial. I'd need to know 

more about exactly how they were prepared and 

for what purpose. They may not be testimonial 

if all that was intended to go into court is 

that one report I mentioned earlier, which is 

like the first three or four pages of the Pet.

 App. 

And then, third, you have kind of just 

Rast's notes, and, by and large, we think those 

probably aren't testimonial.  In particular, 

they contain materials the Petitioner appears to 

agree don't implicate the Confrontation Clause, 

like the graphs from the gas chromatographer 

mass spectrometry machine.

little more than that. They think it did go too

 far. What -- what is the basis of your

 reservation?

 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think

 there is some dispute between the parties as to 

how the jury would have understood this, the

 degree to which Rast may have been testifying --

I'm sorry, Longoni may have been testifying sort 

of verbatim from Rast's notes or how well the 

jury might have understood that to be the case. 

And we're not really taking a position on any of 

that. 

All -- all that said, you know, if the 

Court wanted to narrowly reverse this case, we 

think this is a much easier case than a case 

that we think would follow scrupulously under 

the federal rules. 

And we think, under the federal rules, 

you could have done something like this in -- in 

a case like this.  There'd -- there'd be 

basically three steps to it.  Longoni testifies 

to his independent conclusion that these 

materials are drugs, saying that he reviewed the 

GCMS data that even Petitioner agrees is not 

testimonial.

Second, there'd need to be some chain 

of custody evidence that could come in as it did 

in this case from Longoni himself based on his

 personal familiarity with the procedures at the 

lab that would at least supply circumstantial 

evidence that connected up the bottom-line

 conclusion he's drawing with the case.  And 

then, at that point, as you pointed out, Mr. 

Chief Justice, the defense could just savage him 

for not having an -- an appropriate basis here. 

But we think those two things would at 

least get you over the line to sufficiency, 

which is a -- in any event, a state law or -- or 

federal law evidence issue, and it wouldn't 

present any confrontation concerns because, even 

if you gave the jury a not for the truth of the 

matter instruction in a case like that, I think 

the jury would be very confused.

you tell me whether this is appropriate or not 

and, you know, whether -- oh, that -- that's 

fine or no, that's the reason why we're not 

supporting the State as we usually do.

 So this is after Mr. Longoni gets up 

and they establish that he's reviewed the -- the 

Rast report and also the Rast notes.  So the --

the -- the prosecutor says:  Did you notice 

whether the policies and practices that you've 

just described were followed?  Because he's also 

described the lab's policies and practices. 

And he says: "Yes. 

Prosecutor: Were they followed? 

Yes. 

From your review of the lab notes in 

this case, can you tell me what scientific 

method was used to analyze Item 26? 

Answer: Yes. The microscopic 

examination and the chemical color test were 

used.

MR. FEIGIN: They went much further 

here, and we don't think that's the way this 

should come in, and that's not how we would try 

to introduce it in federal court or, if we did,

 we'd have someone who could testify from

 personal knowledge to that. 

There, you might have a problem, and 

that's not even the kind of thing we necessarily 

think you could get in not for the truth of the 

matter asserted. 

The kinds of things you might be able 

to get in not for the truth of the matter 

asserted, to take a couple of -- of simpler 

conceptual examples, are, number one, you could 

imagine some ballistics evidence where one 

expert does it by taking some measurements and 

calculating based on math and another expert 

sets up some sort of experimental setup. 

The jury might not be able to 

understand the -- either the math or the 

experimental physics, but they might have some 

intuition as to which methodology they thought 

was more reliable. 

Another example might be a case where

we'd urge in the federal courts, but they don't

if this Court were to suggest to us that -- or 

to suggest to the lower courts either that you

 can't have even a "substitute expert" who, to be

 clear, is doing the exact same thing a reviewer, 

a second reviewer at the time would be doing, or 

if the Court were to suggest that we really do

 need a parade of witnesses in these cases, I

 think it would get substantially worse, not

 necessarily because the cases would go to trial 

but because defendants -- and I -- I don't 

begrudge them this -- would have every right to 

put us to our proof, see if we can actually come 

up with the 13 witnesses we need at once and 

only then deciding to plead.  And I -- I think

MR. FEIGIN: There, I was applying 

what I think the Court has announced as its 

test, which is the primary purpose of creating

 an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony. 

I think that's basically a direct quote from

 Bryant.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you have a 

position on whether the test that Justice Thomas 

articulated in Williams versus primary purpose 

is more consistent with the constitutional --

Constitution or better in application? 

MR. FEIGIN: We don't have one that 

we're -- we don't have a position that we're 

presenting today because that hasn't really been 

the focus of the case. I think one thing on 

remand would be whether the testimoniality of 

the statements is still open to question. 

But, as between the two of them, you 

know, if -- if the Court wanted to open that up 

again or to adopt Justice Thomas's test, we --

we wouldn't oppose it doing that.  We just 

haven't, as we admittedly might sometimes do, 

exceeded our focused amicus by suggesting the 

Court take this case as an opportunity to do so. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Feigin, you said

 at one point, I can't remember in response to 

who, perhaps Justice Thomas, that Rast's notes

 came in a couple of different categories and you

 stepped through them -- maybe it was Justice

 Thomas -- and you stepped through them and you

 said some might be testimonial, et cetera.  You 

would need to know more, I think you said, about 

the circumstances under which they were 

prepared. 

Could you say a little bit more about 

that? Is that just the application?  I guess I 

just want to make sure -- let's say that I think 

MR. FEIGIN: Sure. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- they're all being 

introduced for their truth. Are you saying that 

you would need more information to figure out 

whether they were created with the primary 

purpose of creating a substitute for trial 

testimony?

of bare report of these are drugs, this was the 

weight, I'm signing this, this is on our 

stationery, to the extent that was created with 

an understanding that it go into court as

 opposed to, I -- I don't know, some, like,

 national security purpose or something like

 that, I mean, that's probably going to be

 testimonial. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah. 

MR. FEIGIN: Then you have these two 

other pieces of it.  One is just kind of a 

further explication of what the expert did, and 

then the other is what we might call raw data. 

We think the raw data is very unlikely 

to be testimonial.  And the middle kind of, you 

know, here's a little more detail could or could 

not be.  And the things you might want to know 

are, number one, was this just being written 

down because of lab procedures or to document it 

for someone else or for some later internal 

review as opposed to for the purpose of it ever 

coming into court. 

And another one just might be, what do 

the accreditation requirements require?

 Because, in -- for a lot of forensic science,

 there are accreditation requirements that 

require that notes be -- notes be gathered and 

-- and made so that they can do, for example, 

reviews of whether you're following your

 accreditation provisions. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: So it sounds like 

your answer would be different. You know,

 Petitioner said in -- in response to the 

hypothetical he raised about a police officer 

taking notes at the scene of the crime that 

because those would be made with the primary 

purpose of creating evidence or establishing a 

fact material to the case, that those would be 

testimonial.  It sounds like, under your 

definition and your approach to Rast's notes, 

you would disagree with that? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, I -- I would agree 

with Justice Kagan that it would depend on the 

facts and circumstances under which the 

notes were taken. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right, but the facts 

and circumstances being he's jotting notes down 

that he's not doing because he anticipates 

incorporating them into a later affidavit.  He's

and he looks, he can say, you know, here was the 

lay of the land, who do I think the suspect

 might be. 

I understood Petitioner to say that's

 testimonial.

 MR. FEIGIN: Yeah, I think something 

that is created for an investigatory purpose, as 

opposed to with a focus on court, may well be --

not be testimonial. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And so, in your 

response to me about Rast's notes, it's kind of 

like the further away the notes get from the 

report she was creating, that's some evidence or 

a factor to take into account in determining 

whether they were created for the primary 

purpose of being a substitute for testimony? 

MR. FEIGIN: I -- I think that's a 

very important factor, Your Honor, because 

particularly -- I mean, there's admittedly a 

little bit of a chicken-and-egg thing going on 

here with the Court's ruling versus how I'm

 knowledge how the methodology is typically taken 

care of in these situations, that that's --

could be okay and no Confrontation Clause 

problem but that the problem arises, I guess in

 this case, when the expert's testimony actually

 relies on the statements in this lab report 

about what was done to this evidence and sort of 

vouches for that, right? 

When -- when the expert says not this 

is the way things are normally tested and I'm 

telling you that from my expert view, but in 

this particular case, the evidence that was 

collected was tested in a certain way, I'm 

assuming that that's actually true and now my 

testimony is X on the basis of that assumption. 

Is it the government's view that that 

is not being offered for truth or it is in the 

latter scenario?

 its truth, right?  Because you're assuming that 

it actually was done in that way, in the way

 that you're testifying.

 MR. FEIGIN: So where the statement is

 that's a problem -- that's problematic. 

I think there might be -- I would 

reserve, Justice Jackson, just depending on how 

it comes in as trial -- at trial and how it 

actually winds up being shaped and what kind of 

limitations there are on it, something like the 

notes purported to say that these tests were run 

in this case, I have no reason to believe 

otherwise and I have proceeded on that 

assumption, that that --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why is that --

think that's okay is because why?

 the circumstantial evidence.  And it's -- it

 shows what --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But isn't he still 

offering it for truth to the extent that he's

 assuming that it is -- that it did happen in

 that way?

 MR. FEIGIN: I think, in that

 circumstance, all the expert's offering for the 

truth is that the expert's assuming it. 

I think, to get back to the Chief 

Justice's point that these people can be savaged 

on cross-examination, you'd say you're just 

assuming that because that's what -- because 

that's what usually happens and that's what 

purported to happen in this case, but, actually, 

you -- you don't know for a fact that that 

happened, do you? 

And I think you could --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  How would a 

defendant ever, without the lab technician, 

actually challenge the assumption?  Are you 

saying the Confrontation Clause doesn't speak to 

the defendant's ability to challenge the 

assumption in a meaningful way?

MR. FEIGIN: First of all, Your Honor,

 I -- I -- I just want to be quite clear that we 

don't think that testimony has to come in in the

 way I was just describing to you for the expert 

to testify. I think the expert can testify very 

simply at a somewhat higher level of abstraction 

in line with what I was --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But, if he

 doesn't --

MR. FEIGIN: -- explaining to the 

Chief Justice. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- my question is --

yeah. 

MR. FEIGIN: But, if he does, then I 

think where the defense gets its opportunity to 

cross-examine -- and, again, nobody is actually 

saying in this circumstance that the expert did 

these things.  The -- the -- sorry, that the 

testing analyst actually did these things.  The 

testifying expert is simply saying, I am -- you 

know, this is how we usually do it.  I've 

reviewed a case file that says it was done in 

this case.  I've no reason to disbelieve that. 

But makes clear I don't personally -- I can't 

personally tell you that's exactly what happened

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. SAMUELS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. SAMUELS: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

This Court has long been clear and 

Petitioner I don't think disputes that evidence 

that is not offered for the truth of the matter 

asserted, is not offered to prove the truth of 

the matter asserted, does not implicate the 

Confrontation Clause. 

Meanwhile, Arizona law has long been 

clear that evidence offered only for the purpose 

of explaining the basis of an expert's opinion 

is not and cannot be offered for the truth of 

the matter asserted. 

In a case like this, everyone agrees 

that a testifying expert like Longoni cannot 

serve as a mere conduit for the conclusions of a 

testing expert like Rast.  That's just not what

 happened here, though.

 Longoni explicitly testified that he

 could form independent conclusions and then

 testified that he had formed independent

 conclusions and revealed what those conclusions

 were. He based those conclusions on information

 in Rast's notes and the computer-generated

 graphs from her testing.

 The trial judge who heard that 

testimony thus correctly found that Longoni had 

testified to his own opinion and correctly held 

that there was no Confrontation Clause 

violation. 

The judgment below could also be 

affirmed on the independent ground that Rast's 

notes were non-testimonial.  That is not 

something that the State has ever affirmatively 

conceded in this case. 

The notes, which were the source of 

the statements here, were neither prepared to be 

a substitute for trial testimony, nor were they 

sufficiently formal or solemn to qualify as 

testimonial. 

The notes differ in many key ways from 

the report, and Petitioner, perhaps recognizing

this, repeatedly tries to make the report the

 focus of this Court's inquiry, but there is just 

nothing in the record to support the assertion 

that any statements from the report were

 referenced at trial here. 

The closest they get to coming to that 

is they say that he recited the conclusions from 

the report. There's no indication in the record

 that's what he did.  He said the same words, but 

it's just a standard conclusion, it's the 

standard language that a lab analyst would use 

that a substance has a usable quantity of fill 

in the blank. 

In this way and in other ways, 

Petitioner encourages the Court to look well 

beyond the unique facts of this case, and he 

sets his sights instead on a far-reaching new 

rule without any real workable limiting 

principle.  We don't think the Confrontation 

Clause requires the anomalous results that would 

result from Petitioner's rule. 

And we think this Court should decline 

Petitioner's invitation to greatly expand the 

reach of the Confrontation Clause, which is what 

they think they -- what we think they invite.

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  You put quite a bit 

of weight on the argument that Ms. Rast's 

statements or notes were not in -- introduced 

for the truth of those state -- of those notes. 

But, if they were inaccurate or just flat out 

wrong, what would be the value of Mr. Longoni's

 testimony?

 MR. SAMUELS: We don't dispute, Your 

Honor, that the value of Longoni's testimony is 

very much directly related to Rast's notes and 

-- and whether they are reliable or not. But we 

think that's exactly what 703 gets at, which is 

that the jury can use that information, the 

underlying, what we've called basis evidence 

here, to evaluate Longoni's opinion, but not for 

other purposes. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the -- you 

don't think that in the context of this trial, 

of a criminal trial, that that has some friction 

with the Confrontation Clause, if the truth does 

-- is necessary in order for the opinion to be 

useful? 

MR. SAMUELS: No, Your Honor.  I -- I 

think it's helpful to take a step back and think

about what this case would have looked like if a 

limiting instruction had been given, because a 

limiting instruction is something that the

 defendant would have been entitled to if he had

 asked for one.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mm-hmm.

 MR. SAMUELS: And if one had been

 given, I -- I think this Court would presume 

that a limiting instruction would be followed. 

It presumes that in nearly all cases, with the, 

you know, one exception I think of Bruton. 

And we think, you know, counsel for 

criminal defendants have stood at this lectern 

and have argued many times in other contexts 

that certain instructions are very difficult for 

a jury to follow and, nonetheless, the 

presumption applies. 

And we think it would similarly apply 

in this case.  That -- that then begs the 

question, well, why does that matter here 

because there was no limiting instruction here, 

but I think the answer to that question is 

simply that the Petitioner never requested the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I go 

back to one point and that was your argument 

that this is non-testimonial.  The government

 says that's not unclear.  To be frank with you, 

I don't see it argued anywhere below and 

anywhere at trial actually.

 You didn't -- I don't see it anywhere 

in your cert stage briefs in the courts below. 

I see it in your red brief, and you argue it 

here, but you sort of have a footnote on that 

argument and that's all. 

I -- I don't know of any time that 

we've ever addressed a question that wasn't 

raised in the cert brief in opposition here, 

wasn't raised by courts below, was raised in a 

footnote at best in the red brief. 

Isn't the entire premise of the 

question before us that the information was 

testimonial? 

MR. SAMUELS: I don't think so, Your 

Honor, and I'd like to say a couple things about 

that. Let me start with the red brief and maybe 

rewind.

 MR. SAMUELS: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where did you

 argue that in the court below?

 MR. SAMUELS: Happy to proceed in the

 other fashion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.

 MR. SAMUELS: So, in the court of

 appeals, there was a citation to Justice 

Thomas's concurrence in Williams, which was only 

helpful for the State on the testimonial 

question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Have we ever had a 

case where a mere citation preserves such a 

consequential argument as overturning precedent? 

Where did you point out that this --

that all components of this report were 

non-testimonial or testimonial? 

MR. SAMUELS: Candidly, Your Honor, we 

didn't further develop the argument in the 

Arizona court of appeals.  There was --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  So now come

don't think that there was any reason to discuss

 it in the trial court given that the -- the

 trial court's ruling was what it was on the

 other question.  And that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah. I mean, but on 

-- in both the Arizona courts and then also in

 your -- in -- in -- in your -- the filing that 

you filed in the Arizona Supreme Court, although 

they never took the case, but in all these 

filings, everything was about the truth of the 

matter asserted? 

MR. SAMUELS: Well, in the trial 

court, that was the focus.  In the court of 

appeals, like I said, it was except for this 

citation.  In the Arizona Supreme Court --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  I mean, it's a 

citation in, like, a 30-page brief which clearly 

focuses on, you know, the first question that 

you started your -- your -- when you got up to 

the podium, you started with.  It was all about 

that. It was all about the hearsay question.

is it had been settled for, I think, a little 

more than a decade at this point in the Arizona 

courts that that first preliminary question, the 

-- the not for the truth question, settled this

 case. I mean, this was a case decided in an

 unpublished opinion without oral argument in the

 Arizona Court of Appeals on that question.

 And so the State didn't develop a 

testimonial argument right there. But I think 

there was -- frankly, there was never going to 

be any relevance to that argument unless the 

very unlikely event that this Court granted 

certiorari. 

Now I would like to talk about what --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I agree with you.

 It's been totally briefed here.  The question is 

whether it's been forfeited below. 

MR. SAMUELS:  Understood.  And -- and 

last thing I'll say, because this is maybe the 

last brief I haven't mentioned yet, is, in our 

brief in opposition at the cert stage, I think 

even Petitioner understood us to be arguing that 

Justice Thomas's view supported our case here. 

Again, that's only helpful on the testimonial 

question. 

In their reply at the cert stage, they 

say -- they assert that we didn't dispute that 

this was testimonial under the tests applied by 

the plurality or the dissent in Williams. 

Notably absent from that is Justice Thomas's 

view and which we laid out and -- and talked 

about how it -- you know, again, not developed 

with very specific facts, I don't dispute that,

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can --

 question for a minute?  I -- I want to start

 with this -- the -- the report question, which I

 think Mr. Feigin said, you know, on any test 

that we've ever used in this Court is pretty 

clearly testimonial. 

And I think you -- you sort of 

acknowledged that by suggesting that the real 

thing is, oh, he'd only relied on the notes. 

But is -- is that really true? I mean, I'm just 

looking -- I'm just going to read you some 

places where the witness really couldn't seem to 

answer questions without, you know, reviewing 

the report. 

So there's a question: "Did your 

review help show how State's Exhibit 26 was 

tested in this case?" 

And Longoni says:  "May I review the 

report, Your Honor?" 

The court says:  "You may. "

 Another question:  "Did you also look

MR. SAMUELS: The word "report," 

Justice Kagan, is all over the transcript, and I 

-- I -- we made this point in the brief, but I 

want to emphasize a close look at the record 

reveals he couldn't possibly have been looking 

at the report for those statements.  So I think 

you're looking at Pet. App. 40.  That first 

question, did you review how State's Exhibit 26 

was tested in this case?  And he's, you know, 

referencing to the report at that point.  That 

information is not in the report.

that point, but it just sort of shows how, in 

this case, he's up there on the stand and he has

both the official report and some of the notes

 in an -- essentially an appendix, and he's kind 

of going back and forth between them.

 And, you know, that just shows how

 closely related the two were.  That's what he 

prepared from. You know, he reviewed the report

 and he reviewed those underlying notes, which --

which basically, you know, went through --

 because the -- the report, as you say, is just 

the conclusions, but it's the notes that tell 

you exactly what Ms. Rast did in the case.  And 

he is repeating the -- the -- the notes 

essentially to say this is how it was tested, 

this is the -- you know, this -- this -- this is 

what Rast did. 

MR. SAMUELS: We don't dispute that 

he's relaying some information from the notes, 

certainly.  But, as it relates to the notes 

versus report question, you know, we're not 

saying here that he never would have looked at 

the report or that he was totally ignorant of

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And he does state the

 exact same conclusions in the exact same words

 after using the notes to say -- you know, to go 

through essentially in the same words again 

everything that Rast said about what she did.

 MR. SAMUELS: He uses the same words. 

I made the point in my opening, and I -- and I

 think it's an important one, that this is just

 standard language for this.  You know, usable 

quantity of X is the legal thing that you have 

to prove in a case like this.  And I think the 

folks at the lab know that. 

I think it's -- it's also the case 

that if you think about what it is that he is 

actually testifying to, if you look at his 

actual testimony, he's asked specifically if he 

can form an independent opinion. I don't think 

he would have said yes to that question if he 

couldn't form it from, for example, the graphs, 

which he specifically says he looked at. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But we don't have to 

-- we don't have to just accept his word for it, 

right? I mean, we -- we do have to kind of 

figure out the extent to which his opinion is 

independent, and I guess that takes me back to

Justice Thomas's initial question about your

 argument with respect to this being offered for 

the truth of the matter asserted.

 And I created a hypothetical that I'm 

hoping you can respond to that would help me to 

understand what you mean about it not being

 offered for truth.

 So suppose we have a murder that the 

police believe was committed with some kind of 

unconventional weapon that they find in the 

defendant's possession. So I'm envisioning 

something like a unique 3D-printed gun or 

something.  And at trial, the state puts on a 

ballistics expert who has not examined the 

weapon himself, but he bases his opinion on a --

a report of a lab technician who has tested this 

weapon. 

And the lab report says how the weapon 

works, it explains how the technician figured 

that out, it says that the technician took the 

weapon in both of his hands, he stood three feet 

away from the target, he lifted it at a certain 

angle, pointed it, the projectile came out at a 

certain angle and velocity, and here is the 

photographs even of the final result, et cetera,

 measurements, the scatter plot.

 On the stand, the expert says, I 

reviewed the report and the photos and the

 measurements and also the pathologist's report 

of the wound on the victim, and in my expert 

opinion, this is the weapon that killed the

 victim.

 I take it that your argument is that 

the underlying lab reports are not being offered 

for truth in that situation, but I guess I don't 

understand why.  The lab report is what is 

explaining to the expert how this weapon 

actually worked since he never tested it, and 

he's unquestionably assuming the truth of the 

testing as the technician laid it out. 

So why -- why is it that he's not --

that -- that -- that it's not being offered for 

truth in this way? 

MR. SAMUELS: Well, in -- in talking 

about that hypothetical, I think it's important 

to emphasize these cases can be very 

fact-specific in evaluating a question like 

that. It's easy to think about two poles, but I 

think there really is a spectrum. And there's a

spectrum in part because of, you know, as we've 

said, mere conduit testimony is not permitted.

 And so I think there's an evaluation 

that's required in any case and in a case like 

that one to figure out is the expert who's 

testifying really adding something and is his --

is his testimony really the central thing that

 matters.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, he's adding 

something in my hypothetical because the 

technician is not saying anything about whether 

this is the actual gun that killed the victim. 

The technician is just saying this is how this 

machine that you found in the defendant's 

possession works. 

But that's a basis, right?  The expert 

is saying, I have to assume that it works in 

this way because I never -- I never tested it 

myself, and on the assumption that it works in 

the way that the technician says it does, my 

testimony is that this is the murder weapon. 

MR. SAMUELS: So I -- it's possible 

that testimony like that, obviously, might not 

come in because of Daubert or other reasons, but

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes.

 MR. SAMUELS: -- setting that aside,

 if -- if the expert was not familiar at all with 

the type of weapon involved, I -- I'm not quite

 sure how they could offer a completely

 independent opinion.  But, again, assume that

 they have enough expertise in -- in this 

particular type of 3D printing or something like

 that to do that.  I do think it's possible that 

the different basis evidence that you're talking 

about there could be referenced. 

And, again, the defendant --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But let me ask you, 

isn't -- isn't this exactly the Confrontation 

Clause problem that the Constitution worries 

about? Because the expert gets up and he relies 

on this report that explains how this machine 

works, but he has not actually tested it.  So 

the defendant could say, I agree with you, Mr. 

Expert, that if the machine worked in this way, 

it is the murder weapon.  What I'd like to do is 

interrogate whether or not the testing of this 

machine was accurate.  And what -- what you 

haven't done, State, is presented to me the 

person who actually tested it.

I want to say, says the defendant,

 that the photographs that are here are not 

really the photographs, this is not what 

happened, or that you didn't really stand only 

three feet, you stood a lot closer in order to

 make this result.  But I can't do that because

 the expert is not -- the person who tested it is

 not before me.

 I feel like that's the real problem 

that -- that the Confrontation Clause is about 

and that you'd say I couldn't do without a 

Confrontation Clause issue. 

MR. SAMUELS: I -- I just think expert 

testimony is different in several ways, and I 

think that is well established for -- for quite 

some time.  And it -- it's different in a few 

ways, I think, that really matter here. 

One is, under 703, there's going to be 

an instruction if the defendant requests it, and 

the jury, we would presume, would follow it. 

And -- and I think that that's really important 

in this context. 

And so I -- I'm just not sure that it 

is what the Confrontation Clause is designed to 

get at because the jury would be told not to

consider it as substantive evidence.

 I also think, in the context of expert 

testimony, this is maybe a less important point,

 but -- but it's still worth noting that there 

are other ways to confront expert testimony that 

are available that are not available in other

 contexts.  So it's, it -- you know, folks from 

this Court and others have noted that the

 defendant could subpoena the analyst, but set 

that aside for a moment. It's also the case 

that defendants can hire defense experts. 

They'll have disclosures about this testing 

before trial.  They can attack this in other 

ways. 

And so I -- I'm not sure that that 

necessarily is critical to the Confrontation 

Clause analysis, but I do think it's worth 

noting that it makes expert testimony -- it's 

yet another way that expert testimony is 

different from the percipient witness testimony 

that we think lies really at the heart of the 

Confrontation Clause.

oh, I'm sorry, please.

expert's opinion is always worthless unless the

 facts on which the expert relied in reaching the

 opinion are -- are true.

 And so, if we were to say that an

 expert cannot -- that anytime an expert

 testifies based on -- on facts, that that 

suggests that the facts are true, regardless of 

whether they are -- the -- the -- the facts are 

omitted because of a hypothetical or the trier 

of fact knows or is instructed that they're not 

admitted for the truth of the matter asserted. 

I don't know what's left of expert testimony, 

but there's the problem of whether those facts 

are proved. 

So, here, what evidence in the record 

shows that the substances in question were meth 

and marijuana? 

MR. SAMUELS: Sure.  And if -- if I

 because it -- it really does change the 

landscape of Rule 703. And so it could have

 implications beyond that. 

To get to the -- the last part of your 

question about what evidence was in the record,

 I -- I want to be clear, but I take Your Honor 

to be asking about the evidence that -- that

 this particular substance was tested, or are you 

asking about that this particular substance was 

what it --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Was.  So, if the --

you know, the facts on which the expert -- on 

which Longoni relied as an expert in reaching 

his conclusion were not offered for the truth of 

the matter asserted, then what evidence is there 

in the record that the substances were meth and 

marijuana? 

MR. SAMUELS: So there is -- there's 

Longoni's opinions, first of all, which 

obviously are offered for the truth of the 

matter asserted.  And I do think there's, as 

there was in Williams, independent evidence from 

which the jury could draw the conclusion that 

this was the evidence that was tested.

 the crime scene to the courtroom.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.

 MR. SAMUELS: So, if I start at the

 end there, the three substances, Items 20, 26, 

and 28, were admitted as physical exhibits at

 trial. So they were present in the courtroom

by Rast, I think, in terms of substantive 

evidence, a lot of the details that are in the 

record obviously couldn't be considered as

 substantive evidence, but I do think Longoni, 

even if you set all that basis aside, basis 

evidence aside, and pretend it never was 

referenced at all, Longoni testified that he was

 asked to evaluate the materials from a

 particular case, a particular case number.  That 

case number was otherwise in the record from law 

enforcement. 

And I think, if you imagine no basis 

evidence at all, I think at the very least he 

could say, as he did here, that he reviewed the 

records from this particular case number, he 

independently reviewed the materials that were 

there, and these are his independent 

conclusions.  And I think --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Certainly --

MR. SAMUELS: -- that's what I 

understand --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- certainly, if he 

had done so himself and -- and replicated the 

tests, I -- I follow everything you're saying.

I also understand that if he had said,

 well, I -- as Mr. Feigin indicated, that I 

assumed that traditional processes were followed 

and here's what those traditional processes are, 

it would still be incumbent upon the State to

 prove up that that assumption's a valid 

assumption because, as it was done in common 

law, a hypothetical is only as good as the

 hypothetical, right, the hypothetical opinion? 

And if -- if the hypo -- if the bases 

aren't proven up, then the expert's opinion can 

be stricken even at common law. 

And, here, I -- I think Justice Alito 

is just pointing out how could it -- the only 

thing that this testimony could have been 

offered for does seem to be the truth that Rast 

did these tests and found these results. 

And I'm just struggling with how is it 

not the truth, counsel? 

MR. SAMUELS: Sure.  And -- and let me 

try to explain why. If you think about the 

hypothetical I just posed where none of that 

basis evidence was ever referenced at trial,

 But, see, that's the whole point.  I -- I -- he 

-- let's put Rast aside. Rast doesn't exist.

 He -- he just comes in and says, I think this is 

meth and marijuana. That would be stricken,

 right?

 MR. SAMUELS: If --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I assume 

something happened and you never prove up the 

assumptions of what happened.  That would be 

stricken? 

MR. SAMUELS: I think the link I'm 

talking about, which is to say he reviewed the 

records from a particular case number, I think 

would be required in order to make the evidence 

relevant.  I -- I'd point out that relevance is 

really not a constitutional concern, but --

JUSTICE GORSUCH: No, of course not. 

We're not talking about relevance.  We're 

talking about Confrontation Clause, right, to 

confront the witnesses against you, right?  It 

doesn't say witnesses who put their testimony 

with wax seals.  It says witnesses, all 

witnesses.

the United States' concern to be. 

Obviously, we don't think they're

record a little bit here.  But set that 

disagreement aside.  I still think under the

 therefore, I have this opinion.  He didn't say,

 well, if somebody did this and then the State 

later comes back and proves Rast did this 

because they called Rast or something else, that

 didn't happen here.  So I -- I get that there

 are many ways to skin the evidentiary cat, but 

this case just seems to fall on the wrong line

 of it.

 And -- and then, when we get to the 

testimonial question, whether it was preserved 

or not preserved, it's a big question, and the 

Court has splintered on -- on that in the past. 

And you're asking us to essentially adopt a --

a -- a very thoughtful view of one of my 

colleagues, but one of my colleagues, and -- and 

that's -- that's a heavy lift in a case where it 

hasn't been argued below, isn't it? 

MR. SAMUELS: Well, a couple things. 

One is, you know, we briefed both Justice 

Thomas's view and the primary purpose tests in 

the briefs, and -- and we think ultimately these 

are non-testimonial under either view.  And 

so --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So we don't need to 

decide that question?

MR. SAMUELS: Well, in terms of what 

the test is, I mean, we do think Justice 

Thomas's view is persuasive, but we don't think 

you need to revisit the primary purpose test 

because we think, even under the primary purpose

 test, for some of the reasons that I think 

Justice Barrett was getting at with some of her 

questioning, the notes here just are

 non-testimonial under that test as well.  So we 

don't think you necessarily need to confront 

whether to get rid of the primary purpose test 

or anything like that. 

And as to the preservation question, I 

do think it's well established that this Court 

has the discretion to affirm on alternative 

grounds.  And this really is a subsidiary 

question to the Question Presented.  I mean, 

ultimately, the Question Presented here --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  Okay.

 MR. SAMUELS: My point was, you know, 

that this Court's rule, 14.1, says that a 

Question Presented comprises every subsidiary

 question.  Really, at its core, the Question

 Presented here was, was there a Confrontation

 Clause violation?  And deciding that question

 without the testimonial issue just doesn't make

 a lot of sense.  Even Petitioner, as I 

understood them this morning, encourages the 

Court to reach that question, I think, unless 

it's going to come out against them, and then 

maybe issue a narrow ruling.  And I -- I just 

think that this Court really should reach that 

question.  I think there's adequate briefing in 

front of it. 

And I would also point out, to the 

extent that the Court is concerned that the test 

-- the Question Presented assumes that 

statements are testimonial, as it's framed by 

Petitioner, that was exactly true in Bullcoming. 

Nonetheless, it was a significant focus in this 

Court. And again, in Williams, Petitioner tried 

to reframe the question that way.  Five Justices 

found that this was non-testimonial.

 test, I assume.

But go ahead. 

MR. SAMUELS: Well, my point is only 

that, you know, we think Justice Thomas is right 

regardless.  But we just ultimately don't think 

the Court necessarily needs to revisit the 

primary purpose test.  And we recognize that's 

the test the Court has applied. And so, you

just don't think you need to reach that question

 our view, we win under either of the tests. 

These are just non-testimonial statements either 

way. And so we just don't think it's a question

It might want to confront it down the road.

 And I guess I'm not sure that it 

really matters in terms of whether or not we

 think it's problematic.  So could you speak to

 that?

 MR. SAMUELS: Certainly.  So I -- I --

I do think the core disagreement between us and 

the United States is, you know, they say in

 their brief that Longoni appears to have 

possibly served as a mouthpiece for Rast's 

conclusions, testimony, et cetera.  Obviously, 

we disagree with that assessment of the record, 

but we do think it matters to some extent. 

So assume the Court is, you know, 

persuaded by the United States' view or at least 

is heading in that direction and thinks too much 

of the basis evidence came out here or the way 

it came out is problematic in some ways.  We do 

think it's still important to preserve the 

possibility to offer independent opinion 

testimony even if the basis evidence itself 

can't be revealed.  And this was what I was 

trying to get at with Justice Gorsuch.

get at that with Justice Gorsuch. And I guess

 I'm trying to understand.  So you think there's 

a difference between an expert who says my 

opinion is that this is drugs because the lab

 report said so, right -- that's world one; he --

he's testifying to that on the stand -- versus

 the opinion -- the expert who says my opinion is 

that this is drugs, period, but it turns out

 that the only reason, the basis for him saying 

that, was because the lab report said so? 

MR. SAMUELS: Well, in the -- in the 

hypothetical scenario I'm envisioning, he would 

reveal what he's looking at.  He would say, I --

I was asked to pull the records from this case 

number, I pulled them, I looked at them, and 

here's my independent conclusion, without 

telling you anything about --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, he'd say it was 

independent.  But that's the question.  Is it 

really independent if he hasn't done the -- the 

testing on his own? If he has no other basis 

for determining that this is drugs other than 

what the lab report says, does it matter that he 

reveals that or that he just says this is my 

"independent position"?

MR. SAMUELS: I think it matters a

 lot, especially as a practical perspective.  So 

take this out of the drug context and put it in

 the DNA context for a second.  Oftentime the key 

witness in the DNA context who -- who is 

evaluating things at the end wasn't necessarily

 involved in the testing or maybe performed one 

out of five key steps, and then, ultimately, 

they evaluate the materials and reach an 

independent opinion, which is what we think 

Longoni did here. 

And so, if the Court were to conclude 

that, in fact, in order for an expert to rely on 

underlying materials when they weren't involved 

in the testing, that's where we really get 

afraid of the multi-analyst scenario where you 

have the parade of witnesses --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What if the 

conclusion is not that he can't rely on it?

 MR. SAMUELS: Well, the Confrontation

 Clause, of course, is a procedural and not a 

substantive right. And I think that type of 

reasoning starts to put it more in substantive 

territory to say that he's allowed to do a

 certain thing rather than to confront the

 evidence that's offered against him.  And we 

perceive the key evidence being offered against 

him in --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is the testimony?

one is the testimony.

 argument in the proceedings below.  So, as the 

case comes here to this Court, it comes here on 

the assumption that the statements were 

testimonial, and the Court can treat it as such 

in deciding this case. 

But, to the extent that the Court does

 reach the testimonial question, we recognize

 that there is going to be a difficulty.  There

 are going to be marginal cases where 

circumstances are different, and it's going to 

be difficult to apply either the primary purpose 

test, the targeted individual test, or Justice 

Thomas's solemnity test. 

But I'd like to emphasize here that 

this is not a marginal case.  This is a case 

where, under any of those tests, the statements 

here are testimonial. And I'd urge the Court to 

take a look at Pet. App. 127a. That is the 

prosecution, the State, telling Rast that this 

trial has been set in Smith's case, that these 

are the charges against him, and that she needs 

to create forensic analyses, evidence, to 

support the prosecution's case against Mr. 

Smith. 

And it also bears emphasis, if you

look at the notes in this case, they start on 

page 88 of Petitioner's Appendix, and if you 

look at the notes, they are written -- they --

 these are not scrap pieces of paper; they're 

written on letterhead of the Arizona Department

 of Public Services with their seal.  They're

 typewritten.  And they were created on the exact 

same day that the report was created as 

essentially an appendix to that report. 

And so these are not some scraps of 

paper that were scrounged up and provided in 

this case.  They are formalized documents that 

reflect the solemnity of Rast's statements in 

those -- in those documents. And so all of 

those factors, we emphasize, were not present in 

Williams with respect to the report in that 

case. 

Now, to the extent that -- and I -- I 

do want to go back to the hypothetical that I 

was discussing with Justice Barrett.  And we are 

not suggesting that notes, any and all notes 

that are created, are going to be testimonial. 

It is, of course, going to be 

circumstance-dependent.  But what is equally 

true is that a set of notes cannot be said to be

 non-testimonial simply because they use 

shorthand to set forth factual statements.

 So going back to the example of the 

police officer, if the police officer is taking

 statements from a witness -- and this is a 

hypothetical that comes right out of Davis -- if 

the police officer is taking statements from a 

witness and happens to do so in shorthand, that

 does not give the prosecution right to put on 

that police officer to introduce those 

statements from a witness.  Nor does it provide 

a license to the prosecution to put on a 

different police officer and read statements 

from those notes, interpreting those shorthand. 

But, at the end of the day, you're conveying a 

set of testimonial statements, out-of-court 

statements, that have not been confronted. 

Now I want to address a few -- few 

other points.  The -- the United States made the 

point that there -- there may be circumstantial 

evidence.  And, in fact, in Williams, the 

plurality recognized that there was ample 

circumstantial evidence in there that -- that 

the prosecution might have relied on in addition 

to those testimonial statements. And that's

likely to be true in a lot of cases, but, you 

know, that is not what was done here.

 In this case, they didn't rely on

 circumstantial evidence.  They -- they could 

have said Longoni looked at certain data and 

reached certain conclusions based on that data

 in the abstract, but they went further.  They 

went further by having Longoni recite and 

recount from Rast's statements the specific 

items she tested, the particular procedures she 

used, and the results she reached. 

And the reason -- and, of -- of 

course, if -- if the State rested on 

circumstantial evidence, their case would be 

much -- not as strong, certainly not as strong. 

But the strength of their case, as been -- as 

has been noted, is not a confrontation issue, 

and it doesn't raise a confrontation violation. 

The reason that the State recognized that it 

needed to introduce Rast's statements into the 

record through Longoni is that it strengthened 

their case, and that in a nutshell underscores 

why her statements were being offered for the 

truth of the matter asserted. 

One other point I'd like to address,

which is this notion of a limiting instruction. 

My friend at the State indicated that several 

times that Smith did not request a limiting

 instruction.

 It bears emphasis that you get to

 the -- the -- the notion of a limiting 

instruction only after you have a legitimate

 non-hearsay purpose for admitting the statements 

in the first place. If in the first instance 

they are offered for the truth, such as when the 

statement is -- you know, would support the 

expert's opinion only insofar as it is true, 

then it makes no sense from a logical standpoint 

to tell the jury do not consider it.
