 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-1238, the Office of the

 United States Trustee against John Q. Hammons

 Fall 2006, LLC.

 Ms. Hansford.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MASHA G. HANSFORD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. HANSFORD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

This case presents the question that 

this Court left open in Siegel, what the 

appropriate remedy is for the uniformity 

violation that resulted when debtors in a small 

sliver of cases, four dozen cases, in the two 

states that use bankruptcy administrators did 

not pay the increased quarterly fees mandated by 

Congress in the U.S. Trustee districts. 

As this Court has recognized time and 

again, the touchstone of the remedial inquiry is 

congressional intent.  And, here, there's 

unusually strong evidence that Congress would 

choose to fix the constitutional violation by 

mandating uniformly higher fees. That means the

appropriate remedy in this case is a mandate of 

higher fees nationwide, either standing alone or

 in combination with a retrospective effort to 

collect the $3.8 million in fees that the BA

 debtors collectively underpaid.

 Now Respondents instead urge a refund 

remedy which when applied nationwide would

 require taxpayers to foot the bill for

 approximately $326 million to fund windfalls for 

the largest users of the bankruptcy system, like 

Respondents, who paid exactly what Congress 

intended that they pay. 

The problem with that approach is that 

as a practical matter, it'll actually make the 

disparity larger.  Worse yet, it goes directly 

contrary to congressional intent.  Congress has 

for decades sought to make the bankruptcy system 

self-sustaining at no cost to the taxpayer, and 

it enacted the 2017 Act fee increase for that 

reason. 

Now Respondents' argument that the Due 

Process Clause compels this topsy-turvy solution 

simply don't hold up. Respondents must 

establish both that the Due Process Clause 

requires retrospective relief and that that

 retrospective relief must take the form of

 refunds.  But they cannot make either showing.

 Respondents had a meaningful

 opportunity for a pre-deprivation hearing here, 

and the Due Process Clause requires nothing 

further. And to the extent retrospective relief 

is required, that relief should be additional

 collections.

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do we normally look 

to legislative intent to determine the 

appropriate remedy for a constitutional 

violation? 

MS. HANSFORD:  Yes, Justice Thomas.  I 

think this Court's cases are crystal-clear that 

the question and in particular the critical 

question here, which is the leveling-up or 

leveling-down question, uniform fees at the 

higher level or the lower level is a question 

of congressional intent. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What's your best 

example of that? 

MS. HANSFORD:  I think that 

Morales-Santana has an extensive discussion of 

how congressional intent is the guiding

 question --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you have any cases 

in which there was a monetary remedy involved?

 MS. HANSFORD:  Yes, absolutely.  So I

 think the tax cases are classic money cases, and

 in those cases, Levin -- Levin versus Department

 of Commerce, McKesson, all those cases lay out 

that leveling up or leveling down might be

 appropriate. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  It seems that both --

that McKesson or Reich, those cases go the other 

-- don't support you, though? 

MS. HANSFORD:  We very much disagree 

with that, Justice Thomas.  I think those cases 

support us both on the prospective/retrospective 

question but also the leveling-up/leveling-down 

question.  So, first, I -- I think those cases 

make clear that when, as here, there's a 

pre-deprivation remedy, you can have 

prospective-only relief. 

But, more significantly, those cases 

make clear that additional collections can be 

the right remedy, and that's because of the 

nature of the violation here.  The violation 

here is not that Respondents paid a fee that

 Congress wasn't authorized to impose.  There's 

no question Congress was authorized to impose

 the fee.  The mistake here was that Congress

 inadvertently let the BA administrators have the 

option of not charging those fees, so it

 accidentally undercollected.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Does Reich help you

 on the pre-deprivation relief?

 MS. HANSFORD:  I -- I think that Reich 

is inapposite here because it's a 

bait-and-switch case, but I think even in Reich, 

a case where there was a bait and switch and 

there was a state statute that promised a 

refund, but, instead, the state courts tried to 

say no refund was available, even in that case, 

the Court left open a determination of relief 

consistent with McKesson, which could be 

leveling up or leveling down. 

And I think it's critical that even in 

those cases, which I think mainly come up in the 

tax context, where there is a due process 

requirement for retrospective relief, that 

relief can be leveling up. 

I don't think there's any dispute here 

that to the extent every penny of those $3.8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Hansford, I --

I'm troubled by one -- by one piece of this 

case, okay?  I do agree that McKesson and Harper 

say, if you have a pre-deprivation mechanism to 

protect yourself, the government can level up or 

down because you should have taken advantage of 

your ability to protect yourself. 

Putting aside Respondents' argument 

that if they didn't pay the fee here, they would 

have been thrown out of court -- and I agree 

that there's examples of people who didn't pay 

the fee.  They put the money in escrow, or some 

actually withheld it and didn't get thrown out. 

So there -- assuming there's a 

pre-deprivation remedy, which I do, okay, and I 

think McKesson would control, there's a part of 

your argument that troubles me, and it's with

the people who invoke the remedy, meaning I

 under -- in normal course of litigation, if you

 think you shouldn't pay something, don't pay it.

 Go to court and don't pay it.  And some people

 did that.

 But now you're saying to them, you did 

the right thing to protect yourself from the 

inequality, but now I can claw back that money 

when I level down -- or level up, I mean.  To 

me, that doesn't seem quite right.  The clawback 

is what's troubling me because, if you claw 

back, there really is no pre-deprivation remedy. 

You're going to end up having had to pay and 

continuing to pay something you thought was 

unequal at the time. 

And so there's my -- the nub of my 

problem.  It's the clawback.  It's less the --

the concept that you can level up or down and 

say that people who paid and shouldn't have, 

well, that's their problem. They should have --

that's -- you know, they knew that they might be 

paying or should have known they were paying 

more and should have protected themselves, and 

they chose not to.  That's forfeiture and 

waiver.

What do I do with the clawback that

 you're asking for?

 MS. HANSFORD:  So -- so, Justice 

Sotomayor, kind of three things I want to say in

 response to that.

 First, just a small clarification, and

 I take that your premise is there was a

 pre-deprivation remedy in this case, and I think

 that's absolutely correct. 

Just as a clarification, I do think 

that McKesson specifically says, when there is 

no pre-deprivation remedy, you can still level 

up or level down.  The requirement is, in 

hindsight, a uniform scheme which can be level 

up or level down.  So I really don't think the 

pre-deprivation question goes to which relief is 

appropriate. 

But, I -- you know, taking the premise 

of your question there was pre-deprivation 

relief, here, I think that the right solution 

for everybody is the same solution that would 

have happened had Respondents filed suit on day 

one under the Declaratory Judgment Act. The --

they would have obtained a ruling that would 

say, yes, this is unconstitutionally un-uniform.

And we look at congressional intent, and

 congressional intent is plainly -- and I think 

the evidence here is overwhelming -- uniformly 

higher fees nationwide, that means the right

 remedy is a leveling-up remedy of collecting

 additional fees in the BA districts.  And so, 

from day one, those BA administrators would know

 they have to collect the higher fees.  They

 can't have the exception.  They have to follow 

the Judicial Conference's standing order. 

I think that's the right solution in 

this case, and that's -- and so that's why I 

don't think there's any reason to treat people 

who exercise --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that goes back 

to the clawback, because you're saying that -- I 

accept you could -- your equality can be

MS. HANSFORD:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This whole fight 

is about the clawback.  Who gets to claw back? 

Who gets to -- do you get a pass on trying to 

get the money from the people who benefited or

withheld it? Can you get it back from people

who didn't pay or escrow?

 MS. HANSFORD:  But I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's the

 whole issue.

 MS. HANSFORD:  But -- but I think the 

point is that in that case, no clawback would be

 required because the just prospective relief of 

saying, everybody has to pay the higher fees

 would take care of it. And that was the right 

answer then.  And I think there's no way that 

Respondents or anyone else should be able to get 

more, which is payment at the lower levels that 

Congress never intended nationwide because they 

waited. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Let's say --

MS. HANSFORD:  And I do think that --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- it's 

retrospective.  I think maybe that's what we're 

talking about.  Let's say we don't accept your 

argument that it's prospective.  We're saying 

that retrospective relief is required and the 

question is just whether you're leveling up or 

leveling down then. 

I take Justice Sotomayor's question to 

be what about debtors like MF Global.

MS. HANSFORD:  So -- so, Justice 

Barrett, I guess first I want to say that there 

are five cases that we're aware of in the

 category like MF Global.  So, if you do think

 the answer is different as to those cases, I 

don't think that would have a big practical or

 other consequence, but I -- so, I -- if -- if 

you're concerned about that set of cases, I

 would really urge you not to craft the remedy 

for Respondents here based on those cases. 

But I think, as a conceptual matter, 

those cases come out the same.  And if you think 

of the AAPC case, the Telephone Consumer 

Protection Act, the people who -- there was a 

disuniform scheme and the problem with that 

scheme was that there was an exception for 

government debt robocallers, which is what 

created the disparity. 

But I don't think there's a question 

that the people who made non-government debt 

robocalls before even at the time when 

mistakenly the scheme was being administered 

un-uniformly remain liable.  They were always 

required to not make the robocalls, and if they 

did, they remain liable.

clear that you don't need to go back in time and 

compensate those people for -- and that's 

another example of a money case, Justice Thomas

those people for financial penalties or

 financial liability that they incurred because

 they were doing exactly what Congress intended.

me -- let me just ask you this.  Let's assume 

that we disagree with you about the prospective 

and we're -- we're accepting just as I said at 

the beginning that it has to be retrospective. 

Do you want to address the practical 

difficulties, like the former bankruptcy judges 

pointing out the practical difficulties of 

trying to level up here and go back and reopen 

these cases and extract money from the debtors 

in the BA districts?

practical problems on both sides.  And I think, 

overall, the practical problems are actually 

much worse with a refund remedy because it needs

 And so how a refund would need to work 

is the debtor would need to come forward and

 request a refund.  And 85 percent of those cases

 are closed.  In -- in some of them, the debtor

 continues to exist, the reorganized debtor.  In 

some of them, the debtor has gone out of

of people who would be entitled to won't be able 

to, and that's the end of it, but Mr. Geyser 

will be happy and his client will be happy.

 On your end, I -- I think we have to 

tell the Judicial Conference to go do something 

in the first instance. I think we have to tell 

the Judicial Conference, who's not a party to 

this lawsuit -- and I know the Chief Justice has 

great authority over that body. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- but I'm not so 

sure about the rest of us. And what order do we 

issue to them I guess is a question I have and I 

think Justice Barrett's getting at.  And --

and -- and how are they going to go do it? 

Who's going to go do it? 

And these -- those are closed cases 

where, okay, it's not somebody asking for 

something who might lose because his case is 

closed and he doesn't care anymore.  You have to 

go claw it back from somebody whose case is 

closed.  And I just haven't heard of anything 

quite like that before, so help me out.

MS. HANSFORD:  So, Justice Gorsuch, a 

lot of really important things in that question 

and I want to get to all of them.

 I think, to start with the first,

 which is, as a practical matter, what would

 happen if this Court ordered the additional 

collection remedy, I don't think there's

 anything unusual about that.  I think that if --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Ordering a non-party 

to the case to take action? 

MS. HANSFORD:  So I -- so, to be 

clear, I don't think the order in this case 

would be an injunction to the BA districts to do 

that. The judgment in this case is the motion 

to redetermine fees is denied because 

Respondents paid the correct level.  But I think 

this is a problem that arises anytime you have 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, but that's 

premised on the idea that -- that a court can 

compel this clawback.  And I guess I'm wondering 

-- again, I -- I -- we've spoken around -- a lot 

around it, but at the end of the day, for it to 

work, somebody has to order the clawback. 

And -- and I think Justice Barrett's

question and mine is just, honestly, I haven't 

seen something like that before. How does it

 work?

 MS. HANSFORD:  So I don't think that

 in a leveling-down case or a leveling-down tax

 case there's any rule that the judgment --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm talking about

 leveling up.  Just stick with the leveling up --

MS. HANSFORD:  Oh. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and the remedy 

you're proposing. 

MS. HANSFORD:  I -- I apologize, 

Justice Gorsuch. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Put aside the 

leveling down. 

MS. HANSFORD:  That -- that's a 

terminology issue.  By leveling down, I meant 

collection remedy.  We can call it leveling up. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  All right. 

Whatever you want to call --

MS. HANSFORD:  So the collection -- in 

the collection remedy --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Whatever you want to 

call it, counsel, is fine by me. How do I do 

it?

MS. HANSFORD:  So, in -- in the tax 

context, where the courts establish that you can 

level up or level down, there's no rule that the 

court's judgment itself has to compel the 

actors, and I think the reason for that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Fine, fine, fine,

 fine. How does it happen?

 MS. HANSFORD:  So the way it happens

 is that the -- the BA administrators read this 

Court's decision and they see that they are 

required to collect additional fees. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Are they?  They're 

not bound by anything.  They're not -- they're 

not parties to this case. 

MS. HANSFORD:  But I think this 

Court's declaratory judgment that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  There's no 

declaratory judgment.  It's -- it's just that 

Mr. Geyser loses.

particular judgment in this case.  But, as

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  There's no judicial

putting that aside, how practically are they

 going to do it?

 MS. HANSFORD:  Oh -- oh, all right. 

So I'll get back to Note 29 in Morales-Santana 

later, but, as a practical matter, what happens 

is you send a collection notice to the 

reorganized -- so I -- I guess, to start with 

the easiest cases, there are 10 open cases, and 

that's --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Put those aside. 

Those are -- those are -- those are --

 1129(a)(12).

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's helpful.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Ms. --

MS. HANSFORD:  So the -- so I think 

that's a big chunk of it. But I think, for the

 other cases, there is in many of the cases a 

reorganized debtor that still exists or an

 individual.  To that individual, the BA

 administrators send a collection notice. 

We think many of them will be able to 

pay. A lot of the amounts at issue are just a 

few thousand dollars. We think a lot of those 

people will have the ability to pay and will 

pay. If not, it gets referred to the collection 

just like any other government debt. 

We admit that there are at least two 

cases, the liquidated cases, that -- which 

represent a total underpayment of I think it's 

about $27,000 where the -- it will not be 

collectable, and I think the good-faith remedy 

in this case, and this Court has been clear in 

McKesson that perfection is not required, will 

have to accept that you're not going to be able 

to claw back --

MS. HANSFORD:  -- those last pennies.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Ms. Hansford, I'm --

I'm wondering whether this isn't -- I read your

 brief and the arguments that you're making as 

though the collection remedy was sort of like 

your second option, that -- that some of these

 problems that I -- concerns that I share and the 

problems that have been addressed are a reason

 why we wouldn't necessarily think that a 

retrospective remedy is appropriate. 

So it's precisely because going back 

and clawing this money from the BA districts 

that got a windfall before because they didn't 

-- weren't required to pay the higher amounts, 

because that's a little unfortunate and may be 

difficult to do, why the government is saying 

really the best remedy here is to just look 

forward and say, from now on, everybody has to 

pay the same fee. 

MS. HANSFORD:  I -- I think that's 

exactly right, Justice Jackson.  We do think 

that to the extent the Court thinks 

retrospective relief is required, a meaningful 

albeit not perfect collection remedy can be 

executed.  I think that the refund remedy would

MS. HANSFORD:  It's all in the

 Constitution. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- so why would we

 think that the retrospective is -- as -- there

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- right?  It seems 

to me the -- not the Petitioner, the Respondent 

in this case is seeking a refund, which I 

understand is retrospective, but he wants a 

refund.  That's one. 

The second is I guess leveling up by 

making sure that the people who in this window 

of time didn't get the amount or didn't pay the 

amount pay. And that's the clawback that we've 

been talking about. 

And then the third is recognizing that 

the government has changed its policy with 

respect to this, that everyone is now uniform, 

that we just go forward doing a uniform thing. 

So why would we -- what is the

 MS. HANSFORD:  I -- I -- I think that 

you should not do a retrospective remedy. I --

I completely agree.  I think Respondents' only

 argument that that's required is an idea that 

the Due Process Clause compels it because there

 wasn't pre-deprivation relief here, and I don't

 think that's correct.

 But the reason that I agree with you, 

Justice Jackson, that prospective-only relief 

makes the most sense here is, if you look at 

this, the disparity is so tiny, 2 percent of 

cases, about 1 percent of the total payments. 

Congress meant to collect $330 million.  It 

collected 326 million of them because of the 

mistake it made, and so we're 99 percent of the 

way there. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah.  And just to 

be clear, I don't know how I feel. You said you 

agree with me. I don't know.  I'm just trying 

to understand what the -- the basis for saying 

we should do this remedial -- retrospectively 

is. 

MS. HANSFORD:  Yeah.  And -- and so I

 disparity is so small and that you're not going

 to get to a smaller disparity by starting to 

give refunds. Yes, Mr. Geyser might be happy if 

his client gets $2.5 million, but as a 

constitutional matter, that will be a disparity 

of 6.3 million instead of a disparity of 3.8

 overall.  That's worse from the Constitution's

 perspective. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I could understand 

your argument, I mean, you acknowledge that this 

prospective-only solution is one that depends on 

whether the party has been given a meaningful 

pre-deprivation remedy.  Is that correct? 

MS. HANSFORD:  Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And others have 

brought up the fact that there are some people 

out there who actually took advantage of such a 

remedy --

MS. HANSFORD:  Yes.

prospective-only solution to them, or is this a 

prospective-only for Mr. Geyser's client, but

 doesn't work?

 MS. HANSFORD:  So, Justice Kagan, I

 think the better answer is that prospective-only

 works for every single person, with the caveat I 

gave Justice Barrett that the people who invoked 

it are a small universe, so if you're worried

 about them, we -- please don't let that drive

 the decision. 

The reason I think the answer is the 

same for everyone is the constitutional due 

process question is was there an opportunity for 

a pre-deprivation hearing, not whether you 

invoked it or not.  And the fact that they had 

the opportunity for a pre-deprivation hearing 

meant that they were able to get a hearing on 

this question, and as McKesson says in Footnote 

21, that -- that's an additional safeguard that 

ensures that their property wasn't wrongfully 

taken. It wasn't here because they paid the 

right level of fees. 

What was wrong all along is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I had thought 

of the McKesson line of cases as sort of a -- a 

forfeiture doctrine.  It's like we're not going

to worry about you.  If you were given a

 pre-deprivation remedy, you didn't take it, you

 now arrive at this situation, we don't really 

care if you overpaid.

 But -- but -- but, if you think of it

 that way, you couldn't make the answer that you

 gave, right?

 MS. HANSFORD:  Yeah, that's right,

 Justice Kagan.  And I -- I -- I'll take another 

stab at why I don't think of it that way.  But, 

again, if you want to say, there is a 

requirement of a retrospective remedy or of a 

refund for these five cases, we really don't 

have a big problem with that. That's not a big 

cost for the taxpayers.  That's not a huge -- it 

makes the disparity a little worse, but it's not 

a big deal. 

The reason that I don't think that 

it's a forfeiture doctrine is we just want to 

make sure -- and almost always there's a 

pre-deprivation remedy.  That's the hallmark of 

due process.  The tax cases are unusual because 

of the special considerations there.

 getting a pre-deprivation hearing, you're no

 worse off. And I think that even those five 

debtors are no worse off because the right 

answer in their case was always you guys were

 paying the right amount.  You are like the 

robocallers who are not collecting government 

debts. All along, you were supposed to pay the

 higher fees.  The problem was some people were 

allowed to pay less, and the retrospective 

question is, do we need to go back and fix that? 

I think there are a lot of good reasons we don't 

need to do that. 

But I think, as this Court put it, for 

instance, in Collins v. Yellen, one way to think 

about the constitutional violation here is that 

the Constitution kind of preempted by its force 

from the outset this exception for the BA 

districts that said that the BA districts may be 

allowed to pay less.  And if you think of it 

that way, the right rule all along was uniform 

fees at the higher levels.  And there's no 

reason that anyone in that world should be 

paying fees at the lower levels that Congress 

emphatically did not intend.

 understand why the government is conceding what 

Justice Kagan said about the prospective-only 

remedy depending on whether there has been a

 meaningful pre-deprivation -- I -- I mean, I 

understand that comes from McKesson and the tax 

cases, but are those cases really on all fours

 with what's happening here?  I could see a world 

-- have we ever applied those cases and that 

concept outside of the tax scenario? 

MS. HANSFORD:  I can't think of a time 

when this Court applied it outside of the tax 

scenario, but I do read those cases to stand for 

the more general proposition that if we don't 

give you a pre-deprivation hearing, you 

shouldn't be worse off before that.  I think the 

reason, though, Justice Jackson, that you 

haven't applied it out of the tax context is 

because almost always there's a pre-deprivation 

hearing available, as there was here. 

And the reason that this issue and 

this requirement -- constitutional requirement 

of prospective-only relief only comes up in that 

context is because the tax context is a -- is a 

situation where we think the government can 

prevent you from challenging first, getting a

 later.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  What about the

 prospective-only remedies in the Morales-Santana

 scenario, et cetera?  Did -- did that turn on 

whether or not there was a pre-deprivation

 hearing?

 MS. HANSFORD:  Well, I -- I -- so --

so exactly.  In that case, there wasn't -- the 

Court didn't have to say -- it didn't have to 

justify why it was allowed to do 

prospective-only relief.  And in AAPC, this 

Court didn't have to justify why 

prospective-only relief were required. 

I think, if we lived in Respondents' 

world where almost always prospective-only 

relief was not an option, those cases could not 

have come out the way they did because there's 

no -- there's no reason that prospective-only 

relief would be constitutionally permissible in 

those cases but not in this one. 

And I think, again, AAPC is a good 

example.  If you start in that case with the 

premise that, no matter what, you have to do 

retrospective relief, you -- you then get to a

for the unconstitutional fees paid under the

 2017 Act.  Under a century of this Court's

 jurisprudence, prospective-only relief is

 insufficient to redress a past monetary injury. 

If the government unlawfully collects funds, it 

is required to rectify that violation with

 meaningful backward-looking relief.  It cannot

 simply keep the unconstitutional fees and 

promise not to do it again. 

The government is also wrong that 

Respondents somehow forfeited their rights by 

failing to invoke a pre-deprivation remedy. 

Under settled law, due process requires 

retrospective relief unless an exclusive 

pre-deprivation remedy is both clear and 

certain.  The government cannot meet any of 

those conditions here, where the code authorizes 

the same remedies and the same relief before or 

after payment. 

The government finally responds that 

if it can't simply keep the money, this Court, 

acting alone, should authorize what Congress has 

refused to do: implement a clawback program 

seeking 800 percent higher fees in administrator 

districts over a half decade after the fact.

This extreme proposal invites chaos in 

bankruptcy courts and promises an administrative

 morass.

 It is neither legally nor practically

 feasible, and there is zero indication Congress

 would endorse a severe retroactive imposition,

 just as Congress refused to apply the 2020 Act

 retroactively.  The government has not 

identified any statutory authority for 

unleashing a massive fee campaign across two 

states, reopening closed and final cases, 

disturbing confirmed and consummated plans, and 

somehow overriding multiple provisions of the 

Bankruptcy Code. 

Even when construing an actual 

statute, this Court refuses to apply provisions 

retroactively unless the political branches have 

clearly confronted and accepted the acute costs 

and unmistakable language. 

It is stunning for the government to 

ask this Court, without a hint of authority from 

Congress, to impose this kind of profound 

retroactive cost on dozens of bankruptcies and 

hundreds or thousands of stakeholders across two 

separate states.  That is a policy decision

hard-pressed to make the arguments that you're

retrospective argument cannot survive because 

you did have that available.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah.

 MR. GEYSER: -- remedy that

 pre-deprivation relief might be enough.  When 

that question was presented in both Reich and

 Newsweek, this Court couldn't have been clearer. 

It said that there has to be an exclusive

 pre-deprivation remedy. 

And the government concedes in this 

case that this remedy under the code is not 

exclusive.  Parties have -- the absolute right, 

and they've had it for a long time, where they 

can assert a challenge to the fees before or 

after the fact. 

The exact same remedies are available 

before and after the fact. No one is on notice, 

just looking to first principles, that they are 

forfeiting their right to challenge an 

unconstitutional fee unless they object in 

advance. 

That's exactly -- that was the core 

rationale of Reich and Newsweek. It is -- that 

is in also the bait and switch.  And it wasn't 

premised on the fact that there was an 

affirmative statute that says, we'll give you

your fees after the fact.

 It was based on the fact that the 

government was saying in advance if they want to

 rely on a pre-deprivation remedy to foreclose a

 post-deprivation remedy, that if you have a 

problem with this, this is your one and only 

time to raise it. The government can't say the

 Bankruptcy Code authorizes these challenges 

before or later, but, in fact, now we're 

deciding you should have done it before, even 

though there was absolutely no -- no notice of 

that whatsoever. 

And I think Reich and Newsweek 

couldn't be clearer on that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but those 

cases had to do with raising the objection at 

all. Nobody stopped you from getting 

prospective relief.  You've gotten the treatment 

of equality that you sought. 

You came in and said, I'm being

be treated equally.  And the government's

 process 101, you have to make clear in advance, 

providing fair notice to a reasonable party that 

if you don't invoke the remedy in advance, 

you're forfeiting something after the fact. And

 I don't think it --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  The thing that I'm

 struggling with is understanding what difference 

it makes in this particular situation whether 

you had a pre- or post-deprivation remedy when 

it seems pretty clear that making that claim 

leads to the determination not that you pay less 

but that everybody pays more. 

Do you -- do you -- do you concede 

that that's Congress's intention not only sort 

of initially but also as reinforced in the 

legislation that it enacted after this problem 

came to light? 

MR. GEYSER: Absolutely not, Your 

Honor. And just to be clear, if you agree with 

me that then the -- that the solution then is 

either leveling up or leveling down, then I 

think that that would be agreeing that a 

prospective-only remedy is off the table, as I 

think it quite clearly is.

 And I'm just saying, I don't see 

anything in the legislative history, in the, you

developed that would suggest that that's what 

Congress would have intended.

better than legislative history because the 2020

we're going to fix it prospectively only.  That

legislative history, this is in the Act itself. 

They said that the debtors in the administrator

 districts should have been paying this all

 along.

 And you would expect then, if Congress 

were fine with retroactive implication, a

 retroactive clawback, the next sentence would 

be, and now they have to pay those fees. But

 Congress --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No. So I take the 

point, Mr. Geyser, that what Congress really 

wanted was a prospective and don't bother us 

about the past, and that seems fair enough. And 

it -- maybe it supports Ms. Hansford if there 

weren't a constitutional problem, which, of 

course, you say there is as to the 

prospectivity. 

But as to the -- let's put 

prospectivity aside, and you have to level by 

refund or level by collection.  I forget which 

one is up and which one is down in this context. 

It seems -- it -- it seems really hard to figure 

out what Congress wanted because it didn't know 

that everything was going to get messed up in 

this way.

But we do know a couple of things,

 that Congress back in the past, before

 everything got messed up, wanted higher and

 equalized fees, and we also know that Congress

 wants a program which is entirely self-funded 

and which does not impose burdens on the

 taxpayer.

 And when you put the former, which I 

agree is sort of like, well back in the past 

with the latter, which is continual, Congress 

never wants to impose burdens on the taxpayer 

with respect to bankruptcy, you know, it thinks 

that the people who use bankruptcy should pay 

for bankruptcy, then it seems to me that there's 

a pretty strong case that Ms. Hansford says that 

it should be equalization by collection. 

MR. GEYSER: Well, Your Honor, I think 

then, if that's true, then it's up to Congress 

to say that and I think for a few reasons. 

The first is that that would be a 

retroactive imposition.  We can -- we can 

disagree whether it's impermissibly retroactive, 

where it actually would be unconstitutional 

under the Due Process Clause to try that kind of 

remedy, but it is at least severely retroactive.

And if it is, it would be

 extraordinary for this Court, I can't think of a 

single case where this Court has said, in 

fashioning a remedy, it can ignore the fact that

 the remedy that the Court itself would be 

unleashing through a judge-made order, it has to 

make up this judge-made remedy and then it has

 to make up that that same judge-made remedy 

applies retroactively, which is strongly 

disfavored in the law. So I am -- so I think 

that's one major obstacle. 

A second major obstacle is that the 

government's suggestion of just sending out 

bills to debtors is simply wrong.  That's not 

the way bankruptcy works. 

And, in fact, the government's 

proposal would violate multiple sections of the 

code. And they can't just wipe -- just waive 

away those violations.  If Congress wants to set 

aside affirmative provisions of the United 

States Code and the Bankruptcy Code that bar the 

government's relief, then Congress can do that, 

but I don't think this Court can. 

I don't think this Court can authorize 

a remedy that's inconsistent with the Bankruptcy

 MR. GEYSER: But -- but it's not so 

good when you're trying to equalize an 

unconstitutional scheme that's been imposed on

 the taxpayers.  When McKesson suggested the

 possibility that a few people slipping through

 the cracks here and there might be enough, they 

didn't say that 35 percent of the people 

slipping through the cracks would be sufficient. 

But --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Geyser, can I 

ask -- oh, sorry.  Finish. 

MR. GEYSER: No. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I -- I was just 

going to ask you, back to this question about 

prospective and retrospective relief -- I -- and 

I -- I'm not sure if the answer to this isn't a 

loaded question -- does it matter if the request 

was for equitable relief or injunctive relief 

versus money damages? 

I mean, it seems to me Justice Jackson 

asked earlier, do we have any cases outside of 

the tax context?  And I wondered that too, you 

know, outside of the Dormant Commerce Clause 

context or the tax context.

But, as I was sitting down, like, with 

my law clerk and we were debating this, we were

 trying to figure out, in many equal protection 

cases, which would be, you know, similar to the 

Uniformity Clause, where you're talking about

 discriminatory treatment, the kind of relief

 sought is just to end the disparity moving 

forward and it's equitable relief that's sought,

citizenship and -- and those sorts of things. 

And, here, what -- what you asked for 

is money.  Does that -- does that matter?  I 

don't know the answer to that question. 

MR. GEYSER: I -- I think it does 

matter in the sense that when you look at this 

Court's cases -- and, you know, my -- my very 

able friends, they would tell you if they had 

better authority than an immigration case where 

retroactive relief is precluded by the 

Constitution and a robocall case where the party 

was seeking prospective-only relief.  All of 

this Court's cases dealing with prospective-only 

treatment is because that's what the party asked 

for. So it was a very easy question for the 

Court.

And this is where the language comes 

from where the Court says, well, what would

 Congress want?  The Court is trying to conform 

the statute to meet the constitutional standard, 

and all they have to do is -- they're asking the 

same question today as they would have asked all

 the way going back to the beginning when the

 statute was originally passed.  What would

 Congress have done at that moment had they known 

the right answer? 

That's a very different question when 

you have time that has passed, you have a 

constitutional exaction, which is an invalid fee 

that's been collected, and now we have to figure 

out how to provide meaningful backward-looking 

relief. 

And the tax cases too, it's not --

Dormant Commerce Clause cases, they do involve, 

basically, disparate treatment.  It's saying, 

you're favoring in-state people over 

out-of-state people.  It's -- I think it's a 

very close parallel to the uniformity problem. 

And some of this Court's cases also 

dealt with equal protection claims where someone 

was exacted some sort of money that -- and it's

 should have paid it anyway.  The point is that 

if Congress wants or a state wants someone to 

pay money, they have to do it under a

 constitutional scheme.

 And if they haven't -- if they haven't

 done that, then their choices are either to

 level up or level down.  And I agree the

 terminology is confusing.  It's actually flipped 

back and forth at each stage of, I think, all of 

these cases that I know of.  But the -- in this 

case, a clawback remedy simply isn't an option. 

And -- and I want to be very clear why 

that is.  One is that there is a constitutional 

impediment to it.  The administrator district 

debtors will have a solid due process claim that 

this is impermissibly retroactive. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But they're not 

before us. Shouldn't we let them make that 

claim in the next case? 

MR. GEYSER: Your Honor, then what 

will happen is, if that claim succeeds, this 

case will somehow have to come back to this 

Court because it will turn out that, in fact,

 But I think you can see right now even 

from the former bankruptcy judges' brief that 

even putting the constitutional concern aside, 

there are provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that

 foreclose what the government wants to do. I

 mean, they -- when they say they're just sending

They have to go into the bankruptcy case; they 

have to upset a final and non-appealable 

confirmation order.  Right away you're violating 

Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code.

not constitutionally permitted, and I'm trying

 collected under this unconstitutional scheme; in

 not good enough.

 Under the Constitution -- again, this

 is going back for -- for over a century now of

 this Court's cases -- when the government exacts 

money that it's not allowed to have, it has to 

provide meaningful backward-looking relief.  It 

can't just --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why do you say 

they're not allowed to have it, though, in this 

situation?  This is what -- I feel like you're 

conflating different legal frameworks, and 

that's where I'm getting confused.  I thought 

you conceded that they could have the higher 

fee, that everybody agrees that the Congress 

wanted the higher fee. So what is it about this 

that they're not allowed to have? 

MR. GEYSER: It -- it's the exact same 

thing they're not allowed to have in an equal 

protection violation or Dormant Commerce Clause 

violation.  No one in McKesson and Harper was

money. If they do get the money, which they 

will, they can distribute it to the plans.

 Almost every bankruptcy plan has 

provisions for what to do with assets that come

 into the plan after confirmation.  That is just 

a settled, you know, component of a bankruptcy

 plan. So it's really as simple as looking up 

who is entitled to it, sending the check in, and 

it's distributed according to the plan terms.

 Now I do want to provide another

 answer to Your Honor's question about, you know, 

what about the inability to get full refunds on

 our side?

 Now, again, we think it's going to be 

pretty close to a hundred percent collection, 

but even if that's wrong, the provision of full 

relief entitles a hundred percent of the injured 

class to collect.  The only people at that point 

who wouldn't collect would be people who are 

voluntarily electing not to do it. So they 

would -- they would not suffer any 

constitutional prejudice. 

The constitutional prejudice is, in 

fact, cured in full by providing a full refund. 

That's the meaningful backward-looking relief. 

Then the Court doesn't even have to worry how do 

we balance these two things?  The -- the entire 

injured class, anyone who wants to assert their 

rights, will be made whole by a refund. 

And the other point I'd like to make

 somewhat to what -- what does Congress really

 want here.  The -- the Court could order a 

refund, and if my friends are right that there's 

actually no due process problem with asking 

people to pay money, you know, well over half a 

decade after the fact and there's no problem

 with disturbing closed and final bankruptcy

 cases where bankruptcy puts a premium on 

finality, there's no problem with overriding a 

confirmed plan of reorganization that is final, 

non-appealable, then Congress can pass a law 

tomorrow, the day after this Court's decision, 

that says, in fact, we don't want refunds; in 

fact, claw back those funds. 

And then my prediction is the debtors 

in the administrator districts will challenge 

that on due process grounds, and I believe 

they'll probably prevail.  But, at least at that 

point, it's Congress that's doing the work 

instead of the government coming to this Court 

and saying why don't you do what we didn't do? 

In 2020, Congress could have had a

bad. You passed an unconstitutional tax, you

 need to provide meaningful backward-looking

retroactively on the favored class and deal with

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It could have done

 problem.  Now, you know, so this is a -- a

 little bit of a constructive enterprise, 

granted, but we can apply to a constructive

 enterprise the things we know about how Congress

 funds bankruptcy.

 MR. GEYSER: Sure, Your Honor.  But, 

it -- normally, again, if this were an actual 

statute that just said, collect fees in 

administrator districts, this Court would not 

construe that statute to authorize a retroactive 

remedy tacking on fees five years after the fact 

unless Congress spoke clearly and unmistakably. 

When -- when even the Court in the 

Bowen case asked, does an agency have the 

general authority just as a background matter to 

apply statutes retroactively when a regulation 

is struck down for technical problems, they're 

basically trying to say, look, we goofed.  We're 

going to do it right this time and cover the 

full period.  This Court said the agency doesn't 

have that authority.

about here is how impossible it is to give a 

retrospective remedy in this case either 

leveling up or leveling down.

 You've made very ably the argument for 

why it's impossible to do it retrospectively

 leveling up.  And Justice Kagan points to the 

argument about why it's impossible to do it

 retrospectively leveling down because it's 

inconsistent with the entirety of the bankruptcy 

scheme as Congress has laid it forward. 

So I guess I'm just trying to 

understand why we couldn't rely on something 

like Morales-Santana and the fact that it -- if 

it's hard to do or impossible to do, then we can 

just go prospective. 

MR. GEYSER: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that if you want to read something from 

Morales-Santana, it's that the government's 

theory of clawing back funds is not a 

permissible theory in this case. It's not an 

option they have because they need affirmative 

relief from Congress to --

 Court wanted to adopt that theory, it would have 

to affirmatively overrule Reich and Newsweek. 

It would really be picking a direct fight that 

-- in a way that can't be squared with those 

cases. 

Those cases made abundantly clear that 

unless there is an exclusive pre-deprivation 

remedy, the government has to provide meaningful 

backward-looking relief.  So, I -- and, again, 

when we look at the most directly --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Have you dealt 

with all three of the government's cases yet?

a -- there was a two-Justice concurrence that

 said that because of the plenary authority of 

Congress over citizenship, the Court doesn't

 have the power to adjust citizenship looking

 backwards.  It has -- it can -- has to do

 whatever Congress has said in terms of whether

 citizen is -- citizenship's conferred or not.

 And the majority opinion didn't spell 

out that rationale, but if you look at the pages 

in the briefs, the parties' briefs that they 

cite for this very point, it spells out exactly 

that rationale.

 question.  It wasn't resolving it. It said,

 the -- the result in this case does not lift the

 fines that have been imposed.

 It didn't necessarily say that if 

someone had brought that challenge, because,

 again, the petition -- the challengers in that

 case, they didn't have any fines.  Their 

contention was going forward seeking prospective 

relief, we'd like to make these calls.  And the 

Court sensibly said, you're violating a general 

robocall provision that's been in place for 

decades and so you can't do that. 

But that's very, very different, the 

fact that they're relying, that the government's 

relying on a case like that instead of cases 

involving an illegal exaction of money under a 

scheme that treats one class differently than 

another, like, it doesn't take a whole lot to

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just -- I just

 wondering if it matters that there are 

individual rights at issue in some of these

 equal protection cases.

 It seems to me that this uniformity 

constitutional provision that's at the heart of 

this is really about limiting congressional 

power. And I guess you could say the same is 

true of the Commerce Clause.  So I appreciate 

that. 

But is there something to the notion 

of we're not going to necessarily worry about a 

meaningful backward-looking monetary remedy for 

a violation that is really about limiting 

Congress's power and has been remedied because 

Congress has changed the statute now and 

everybody's being treated equally going forward? 

MR. GEYSER: So I -- I think, Your 

Honor, you -- you stole my first answer, which 

is that it is exactly the same as the other

 provide meaningful backward-looking relief.

 The second is that this is

 constraining Congress's authority, but it's 

constraining Congress's authority to protect

 individuals.  It's so that certain debtors don't

 find themselves disfavored with respect to other

 debtors.

 So I do think there is an individual 

rights component to the right that's being 

protected.  And now that we've paid that money 

under that unconstitutional scheme, if Congress 

wants to say tomorrow to make this Court's job 

very easy, it could say, Congress hasn't spoken. 

Normally, when the Court confronts these types 

of questions, it gives the state or the 

government a reasonable amount of time to 

respond, and when they don't, they say, the 

injured party doesn't have to wait any longer. 

We're going to order a refund.  And --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MASHA G. HANSFORD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. HANSFORD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

 Justice.  I want to start with Justice Barrett's 

question of whether what the parties asked for

 matters.

 I think both in Levin versus

 Department of Commerce and Morales-Santana 

Footnote 29, the Court said that the -- what the 

parties asked for does not circumscribe the 

relief offered and parties never asked for the 

relief of the withdrawal of the benefit, and the 

fact that you're allowed to withdraw the benefit 

shows that you don't need to reward the 

successful challenger.  That was the case in 

Morales-Santana. That was the case in AAPC. 

Neither one got the relief they wanted, and when 

this Court specifically addressed that and said, 

they may be no better off, but that is not a 

problem. 

To address the Manhart case that my 

friend talked about, I do think that that is a 

great example of a case that was about money. 

There was a specific dispute as to whether money 

should be paid back.

There was no question in that case

 that women paid too much into pension funds 

because they were women and were required for 

that reason to pay too much. And the Court

 said, even in that circumstance that's illegal.

 Title VII prevents it. There is a statutory 

presumption of backpay that the statute provides

 and still we're not going to award retrospective 

relief because this was probably a good-faith 

mistake, there were reasons for it, and the 

financial impact nationwide would be too much. 

I think that reasoning applies a 

fortiori here because the Constitution does not 

provide that backpay should be allowed.  It does 

not have a presumption of retrospective relief 

in this context. 

I would also point you to the Fulton 

case. That is a tax case.  That's where the --

I -- I think what the Court normally does in 

cases when it withdraws a benefit is it does it 

prospectively.  That's more comfortable. The 

exception to that is the tax context because it 

can't do it because of the due process overlay. 

And so Fulton is a case where there was no 

argument there was pre-deprivation relief, so it

had to be retrospective, but the Court left open 

whether it's level up, level down. And on 

remand, the court did impose additional

 collections.

 On the argument that the clawback 

didn't work, I think, as my friend's exchange 

with Justice Kavanaugh made clear, the refund

 also won't work.  And if you think the Court

 needs to wait and see how well we do the 

collections, well, before giving my friend a 

refund, you need to wait and see whether we can 

actually successfully refund the $326 million, 

and until we get to 322 million, things are 

worse off from the Constitution's perspective 

because the Constitution is not like the False 

Claims Act for relators where there's a bounty 

for being a successful challenger.  All the 

Constitution wants here is uniformity in one 

direction or another.  We're 99 percent of the 

way there.  And I think starting to give refunds 

might make the Respondent happy, but it's not 

going to be a more constitutional solution.

the reason that Congress didn't do it on day one 

is because my friend and others waited to bring

 these suits.  My friend waited for two years

 after this was enacted to bring the suit.  He 

could have brought the suit earlier.

 And Congress was incredibly proactive 

here. It responded to the body of lower court 

cases before they even reached this Court, 

before the Siegel decision.  If these suits had 

been brought on day one, Congress could have 

fixed it on day one.  My friend never would have 

been subject to the disparate treatment of some 

BA debtors paying less.  But he would not be 

financially any better off because, of course, 

his injury is not that he paid the 2.5 million 

in fees that Congress wanted him to pay.  It's 

that these 48 debtors paid too little. 

Just one tiny factual point, which is 

my friend talks about how high this increase is, 

800 percent higher.  The fees were, oh, there 

was a 1 percent cap on the fee increase.  So my 

friend's clients overpaid 2.8 million on a 

billion dollars in disbursements.  This is a fee 

on the largest users who are best situated to

 So I guess I would just say that my 

friend's remedy of refunds would undo the 2017 

Act, which was meant to protect taxpayers, and 

it would require them to pay hundreds of 

millions of dollars to reimburse the bankruptcy

 system's largest users.

 It flies in the teeth of congressional

 intent.  It flies in the face of Congress's 

specific findings in the 2020 Act, which not 

only were that Congress always wanted these to 

be uniform, but also Sections 2(a) and 2(b) of 

the 2020 Act talk about Congress's specific 

intent that the system be self-funded at no cost 

to taxpayers.  And the idea that Congress would 

choose a refund remedy of undoing the 2017 Act 

flies in the face of congressional intent and 

the democratic process. 

We ask the Court to reject that 

approach and to reverse.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the case 

was submitted.)
