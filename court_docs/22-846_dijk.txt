 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-846, Department

 of Agriculture Rural Development Rural Housing

 Service versus Kirtz.

 Mr. Snyder.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W. SNYDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SNYDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The question in this case is whether 

Congress unambiguously waived the sovereign 

immunity of the United States when it amended 

the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to provide 

that any person who violates FCRA's requirements 

is liable for money damages. 

The answer to that question is no.  To 

start, there's no basis for claiming that 

Congress has expressly waived sovereign 

immunity.  For all of Respondent's emphasis on 

following the literal text of the statute, he 

ultimately has to concede that nothing in FCRA 

addresses sovereign immunity directly. 

Instead, Respondent is asking this

Court to read an unwritten waiver into the 

statute on the theory that every time Congress

 creates a cause of action that applies to both

 sovereign and non-sovereign defendants, it must 

implicitly intend to eliminate sovereign

 immunity.

 But that argument is wrong for two

 reasons.  First, it's fundamentally inconsistent 

with the nature of sovereign immunity. 

Sovereign immunity is a defense that, by 

definition, has effect only when there is a 

cause of action that would otherwise impose 

liability.  So, if every cause of action that 

covers a sovereign also waived that sovereign's 

immunity, the defense would never matter.  That 

cannot be right. 

This Court has therefore followed a 

narrower rule under which courts may infer a 

waiver of sovereign immunity from a cause of 

action only if Congress has referred to 

sovereign defendants in the cause of action 

itself using language that would be effectively 

negated if sovereign immunity remained available 

and that therefore shows Congress's intent to 

displace the presumptively available defense.

But there's nothing like that here. 

And as the Court's decision in Employees shows,

 the mere use of a general term defined elsewhere 

in the statute isn't enough to eliminate the

 sovereign immunity defense.

 Second, it's in any event far from 

clear that these causes of action apply to the 

United States at all. Even the court of appeals 

recognized that FCRA's criminal provision uses 

"person" in a sense that does not include 

federal agencies, and it's plausible to 

interpret the nearby civil causes of action in 

the same way. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Snyder, the --

putting aside sovereign immunity, the statute 

refers to -- defines a person as any individual, 

et cetera, and any government or governmental 

subdivision or agency.  Putting aside the issue 

of sovereign immunity, wouldn't that suggest 

that it applies to the -- the U.S. Government? 

MR. SNYDER: So we accept that that's 

a plausible reading. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So, if -- if it does 

that as explicitly as it does, why doesn't --

isn't that sufficient to waive sovereign

 immunity?

 MR. SNYDER: So -- so two answers to

 that, Justice Thomas.  We don't think that it

 unambiguously covers the United States.  And I'd 

-- I'd say our argument on that front is under 

the Court's decision in Utility Air. I would 

say that's the best decision for that part of

 our argument. 

You're asking, even if I assume that 

1681n and o use "person" in a sense that does 

cover the United States, does that also take the 

analytically distinct step of waiving sovereign 

immunity. 

And so putting aside the Utility Air 

argument for a moment, on that argument, we 

would say no because all the text of the statute 

does is create a cause of action and it does so 

using a general word that, on hypothesis, covers 

both sovereign and non-sovereign defendants. 

But there's nothing necessarily implicit in that 

to show that Congress must have intended to 

waive the defenses that all defendants covered 

by that cause of action would have available 

under ordinary background principles.

So I don't think anyone would think 

it's strange, for example, if a defendant who's 

covered by the plain text of the cause of action 

but who violated FCRA more than five years ago 

were to assert a statute of limitations defense. 

That doesn't negate anything in the cause of

 action.

 And similarly here, the fact that,

 again, on hypothesis, some defendants covered by 

the cause of action would be able to assert a 

sovereign immunity defense doesn't negate 

anything in the statutory language that Congress 

used in adopting that cause of action. 

Now it is a different --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure I 

understand that, Mr. Snyder.  I mean, suppose 

that we just take the definition and we plug it 

into n and o. What would your answer be then? 

MR. SNYDER: So, if the Court were to 

plug all of the words from the definition into n 

and o specifically, then the only -- the only 

purpose of those words in n and o, the words 

referring to governmental entities, would be to 

make clear that Congress is authorizing recovery 

against sovereign defendants.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, I mean, it falls 

into the whole line of cases where Congress has 

authorized a cause of action against the

 government, and we say, well, that's 

inconsistent with the recognition of sovereign 

immunity.  Sovereign immunity would negate the 

very cause of action that Congress has created, 

right? Those are the line of cases that we 

discussed just last year. 

And what you're saying to me is, yes, 

if you plug the definition into n and o, the 

liability provisions, those cases would -- you 

know, the -- the same answer would follow? 

MR. SNYDER: Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So then -- then 

why does it make a difference that they're not 

plugged in to n and o but instead -- you know, 

the definition has a lot, a lot, a lot of words, 

right? There's a person, there's a corporation, 

there's an association, there's an enterprise,

et cetera, et cetera.  You can see why Congress 

didn't want to say that every time Congress 

meant to refer to a lot of different entities.

 So -- but, you know, it's statutory 

interpretation 101 that we take a defined term, 

we plug the definition in, and that's what the 

meaning of the statute is. So that's what the 

meaning of the statute is.

 MR. SNYDER: So, Justice Kagan, if the 

question here were just what the meaning of the 

words in the cause of action were, I -- I would 

agree with you.  So last term, in Lac du 

Flambeau, for example, there was an express 

waiver of sovereign immunity that made 

absolutely clear that what Congress was 

intending to do was waive sovereign immunity, 

and it did so on behalf of governmental units 

and then defined governmental units elsewhere in 

the statute.  And this sort of subbing in the --

the words from the definition -- definition into 

the waiver of sovereign immunity would have 

worked perfectly there because all you were 

asking was what do the words that Congress used 

mean. 

But, here, you're not asking just what

do the words mean; you're asking about the --

the necessary logical implication of what

 Congress has done.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the -- the

 necessary logical implication of what Congress 

has done is authorize a suit against people, 

persons, as defined in the definitions section. 

Then you go to the definitions section, and then 

you discover that what Congress has done is 

authorize a suit against natural persons, 

enterprises, and governments. 

MR. SNYDER: So, respectfully, Justice 

Kagan, I don't think that's right. At the time 

that Congress adopted that definition, the one 

thing we know is that it wasn't doing so for 

purposes of allowing civil recovery against 

everyone covered by "persons" because the 

statute didn't authorize recovery against 

"persons" at the time. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, but then --

then there was the amendment.  So why -- why 

can't we assume from that that Congress was 

trying to reach all of the defined entities? 

MR. SNYDER: I -- so I -- I think 

maybe that would be a plausible reading of the

 sovereign immunity, you have to conclude that 

it's the only plausible reading of the statute.

 So just --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And why -- why isn't

 it not the only plausible -- I mean, Congress 

amended the statute clearly to expand liability.

 Do you -- do you concede that?

 MR. SNYDER: Yes, we agree with that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And 

it -- and it expanded liability by substituting 

the previous terms, which were narrower, you 

know, specifically referencing only "any 

consumer reporting agency or user of 

information," it expanded liability by striking 

that and putting in the word "person" and the --

or "any person," and "any person" is elsewhere 

defined in the statute to include government. 

So what is not clear about Congress's 

intention to expand liability to include 

government? 

MR. SNYDER:  So -- so we do have this 

other argument about whether it's clear that 

Congress actually intended "person" to include 

the government, and I -- I do eventually want to

get to that.

 But just, I think you're asking me to 

assume that "person" takes the statutory

 definition in 1681n and o and why isn't that 

enough to show that Congress must have intended 

to waive sovereign immunity.

 And my answer is that it's not unusual 

for Congress to create a cause of action that 

applies to a range of defendants, some of whom 

will still have defenses from other background 

principles of the law. 

Now, in the cases that this Court was 

referring to in the Financial Oversight and 

Management Board --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, I -- I'm 

sorry --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Wouldn't --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- to interrupt, but 

I -- I -- I just want to understand the nature 

of your argument in responses to my colleagues. 

It could be one of two things it seems 

to me. One -- one, it might be that n and o 

don't take the definition, or, two, they do take 

the definition and that's still insufficient. 

Which is it?

deal of difference.  We've said they're

 virtually conclusive.

 MR. SNYDER: Yes.  But this Court has 

also rejected the idea that you always just plug

 in the terms wherever the -- the defined term

 appears in the statute.  I think the Court's 

decision in Utility Air is really significant on 

this and, in particular, the structure of the

 Court's reasoning in that decision. 

So Utility Air involved provisions of 

the Clean Air Act that applied to facilities 

that emitted any air pollutant, and EPA had 

concluded that those provisions unambiguously 

applied to facilities that emitted greenhouse 

gases because the Act-wide definition of "air 

pollutant" include greenhouse gases. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why -- we -- we've 

read all that.  I -- I guess I'm wondering, why 

isn't it virtually conclusive here? 

MR. SNYDER: So the reason is that 

just as in Utility Air, there were other 

provisions of the Act that used "air pollutant" 

in a sense narrower than its defined meaning. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And there may be 

other provisions in which it's more narrowly

We're talking about n and o here, though,

 reporting about consumers' debts and 

delinquencies, say that the government should 

turn square corners too, just like other private 

credit reporting agencies, and that when it 

falsely reports a consumer's debt, it should --

it should pay that, n and o.

 Let's not talk about q.  Let's not talk about 

Utility Air.  Let's talk about n and o. You 

have to come up, it seems to me, with some 

argument that it's inconceivable Congress would 

have wanted to do that sort of thing. 

MR. SNYDER: Respectfully, Justice 

Gorsuch, I -- I think our task is to show that 

it's plausible that that's not what Congress did 

here. That's what the clear statement rule 

requires.  And we think that because Congress 

has --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, we're --

the United States, and we think it is therefore 

plausible to think that when Congress used the 

word "person" in n and o, it was also using n

 and o in a sense --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What are your best

 examples of that?

 MR. SNYDER: So we think 1681q, I know 

I've been asked not to talk about that, but --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You can talk about 

it with me. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. SNYDER: We think that 1681q 

clearly uses "person" in a sense that does not 

use the Act-wide definition.  Even the court of 

appeals recognized that it would not be 

reasonable to think that Congress authorized 

criminal prosecutions of the United States just 

through the bare use of the word "person" and 

that it must have meant something narrower 

there. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why -- what --

why is that a definitional change? I mean, I 

think the problem that I'm having is that A, in

 And I understand your point about q,

 but why isn't that just a carve-out?  They're 

just saying that, you know, certain categories 

of persons can't have criminal prosecution, but 

it's not a change in the definition of "person."

 MR. SNYDER: I -- I -- I guess that's 

not the way I read that provision. I think that 

the statutes in both Utility Air and Employees 

had similar provisions that said this definition 

applies everywhere.  In Utility Air, the Court 

said but we know that Congress didn't always use 

the defined term in a sense that carried its 

defined meaning, and so, when it appears in the 

provision at issue, it's not unambiguous that --

 incongruous or why it suggests a problem.  I 

went back and researched the Clean Water Act, 

the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the

 Agricultural Adjustment Act.  At least three --

I didn't canvass the universe -- include a 

criminal provision that applies to the United

 States that's nearly identical to this one. It 

says imprisonment and/or fine.

 So I don't know why copying what has 

been used in other acts for which there's no 

question that there's a waiver of sovereign 

immunity, why the fact that they refer to 

imprisonment or -- and fine means that somehow 

sovereign immunity wasn't waived. 

MR. SNYDER: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's a common 

provision written exactly like this one is, and 

in those acts, we've never said their existence 

calls into question the waiver of sovereign 

immunity.

you referring to criminal provisions in those 

other statutes?

significant thing about the criminal provisions

 elsewhere in the -- the Code, my friend has 

pointed to just one, that when Congress has

 wanted to accomplish that really unusual result, 

it has been just crystal-clear that that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  That's what

 I'm saying to you.  Read the -- the best example 

is the Clean Air Act. It's virtually identical 

to this one. It basically says any person who 

violates the Act -- and there's no doubt that 

the "person" is the government -- is subject to 

imprisonment or a fine. 

So it's written identically to this 

provision.  So, if I have that as text and I see 

it in other statutes, I don't know why reading 

it here would be incongruous to me or suggest 

that somehow Congress didn't intend "person" to 

mean exactly what it means.

Sotomayor, even the court of appeals recognized

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's all 

right. We had the same problem in the Kimel 

case, and in the Kimel case, we had three layers 

of reference to the waiver of sovereign 

immunity, and we didn't require magic words.  We 

just figured out what the definition was, even 

though it referred to another statute and the 

other statute referred to a different provision. 

And yet, no magic words were required. 

And in Kimel, we had exactly the same 

thing. The government argued that it was 

incongruous to permit suits against the state 

because the states hadn't waived their sovereign 

immunity.  But that's a different constitutional 

provision. 

MR. SNYDER: So, in Kimel, there was 

language in the cause of action itself that was 

there only for the purpose of authorizing

suits --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, assuming we 

buy your first argument that any person who is 

negligent doesn't mean the sovereign, if it's

 negligent, is responsible.  We have to take that

 first step, right?

 MR. SNYDER: So that -- just to be

 clear, that's not our first argument.  Our first 

argument is that even if you think the cause of 

action covers both sovereign and non-sovereign 

defendants, as this Court recognized in 

Employees, the -- the question of whether the 

government -- or their -- Congress has lifted 

the sovereign immunity defense is analytically 

distinct from it.  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It is analytically 

distinct.  It can't lift state sovereignty.  So 

it can't do it here either. 

MR. SNYDER: So, in Employees, the 

Court assumed that Congress would be able to 

lift sovereign immunity.  That was -- that was 

before '75. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that was --

Employees is an old case, 1973, analyzed in a 

very different way with a lot of different

 issues.

 MR. SNYDER: So, Justice Sotomayor, I 

-- respectfully, I disagree with that.  I mean, 

I think this idea that Employees and Parden are 

sort of of a piece in the bad old days, I just

 don't think that's a plausible description of

 those cases.  So, if you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We'll let the 

other side answer that.  I don't want to 

monopolize you.  So --

MR. SNYDER: Just briefly on that, I 

mean, in College Savings Bank, the opinion for 

the Court by Justice Scalia said -- points out 

that Employees was written by one of the Parden 

dissenters over the solitary dissent of Parden's 

author and that it began the Court's retreat 

from Parden. So I think Employees is entirely 

consistent with this modern -- this Court's 

modern approach to sovereign immunity. 

The -- the other two parts of the 

answer that I promised Justice Alito I was going 

to get out, we would -- we think it's 

significant that the 1996 amendments occurred 

just months after Seminole Tribe.  The idea that 

Congress adopted this plainly unconstitutional

statute without saying anything at all in the

 statute itself or the legislative history we

 don't think is plausible.

 We also think it's significant that

 these were adopted at different points in time, 

so you don't have Congress adopting a cause of 

action applicable to persons and then saying at 

the same time that for those purposes, we want

 this -- "persons" to include the United States. 

And then, finally, we think there are 

a number of other statutes where, as with FCRA, 

Congress has defined "person" to include the 

United States, but then, in the causes of 

action, when it's wanted to authorize recovery 

against the United States, it hasn't just relied 

on that general definition of "person."  It has 

said in RCRA, for example, that suit is 

"authorized against any person," comma, 

"including the United States." 

And, Justice Kagan, to go back to 

where we started with why that is different from 

a case where Congress has just -- I realize I've 

-- I skipped over Justice Alito, but --

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's okay.  That's 

fine.

be arguing against each other?

 MR. SNYDER: I -- I think that's

 right. I mean, it's a pretty incongruous idea.

 We think that if Congress wanted that result, it 

would have made it much clearer than just using

 the word "person."

 Again, though, the reason that it 

matters why Congress uses just "person" or 

instead addresses the -- the sovereign in the 

cause of action itself is that when Congress 

uses references to the sovereign itself in the 

cause of action, the only purpose those words 

can serve is to authorize recovery against the 

sovereign. 

And so, in Financial Oversight and 

Management Board, the Court said that when 

Congress has expressly authorized suits in that 

way, it would effectively negate the statutory 

language to allow the assertion of a sovereign 

immunity defense.  And in that circumstance, the 

Court has been willing to infer that Congress 

must have intended to waive sovereign immunity. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it does negate 

the statutory language if you do the normal 

thing that we do in interpreting statutes, which

 So, here, plug in the definition to n

you were doing that because of sovereign 

immunity and it's important to protect the fisc 

of the United States against ambiguous 

derogations of sovereign immunity.

sovereign immunity, and the question is whether 

Congress has done so.

 MR. SNYDER: Yes.  And nothing in the

 MR. SNYDER: Nothing in the statute

 says anything about sovereign immunity.  You can 

only do that from implication.  And we think, 

logically, the fact that Congress didn't specify 

sovereign defendants in the cause of action 

itself means that implication is not available

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I do have one

 question.  So putting aside what n and o mean --

we -- we've gone around that tree -- your --

your -- your second argument was that Congress 

needs to be clearer than even that to waive

 sovereign immunity.  Even that wouldn't be

 enough.

 And I guess I -- I wonder why.  I

 certainly understand -- this is kind of a first 

principles question.  I certainly understand the 

clear statement rule this Court has developed to 

protect the Eleventh Amendment and state 

sovereign immunity, separate sovereigns. 

But, here, we have the sovereign 

itself speaking, right?  It's not waiving 

someone else's immunity.  It's not purporting to 

strip another entity of its protections under 

the Constitution.  It's Congress, which it has 

control over the federal fisc, itself deciding. 

And I -- so -- so I wonder why the clear 

statement rule would be appropriate in those 

circumstances. 

MR. SNYDER: So two answers to that, 

Justice Gorsuch.  The first is that Respondent's 

argument has exactly the same effect in terms of

Congress's meaning as to states and in terms of 

its effect as to Indian tribes and foreign

 nations.  If you rule against the United States

 here, you will necessarily be saying that it

 waived sovereign immunity for them too.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You're -- you're --

you're just fighting my question.  I'm -- I'm 

saying it is different. It is one thing to 

waive a tribe, a state, a foreign government's 

immunity.  Congress purport to exercise that 

power under the Constitution, an extraordinary 

power. It's permissible sometimes, but, 

generally, we think of as inconsistent with the 

structure of our Constitution, and that's why we 

have traditionally required a clear statement 

rule. 

It's less clear to me what 

justifications we have for requiring magic words 

to waive sovereign immunity when it's the 

sovereign itself opening itself up to suit. 

MR. SNYDER: So we, of course, don't 

think it's magic words, but that's not your 

question.  This Court has repeatedly said that 

it applies the same standard when evaluating --

asking why.

 MR. SNYDER: So the Court has 

identified a number of justifications for --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What do you think

 it's saying?

 MR. SNYDER: -- the clear statement.

 I'd combine two.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.

 MR. SNYDER: First, as Federalist 81 

said way back at the founding, it was well 

established then that the sovereign could not be 

haled into court without its consent. 

And, second, tracing all the way black 

to Blackstone, it was well settled that courts 

should not interpret statutes to apply to the 

sovereign unless that was the only permissible 

reading. 

And so, by the middle of the 19th 

century, courts had recognized that in light of 

those two principles, you couldn't read a 

congressional enactment to waive sovereign 

immunity unless that was the only plausible 

reading, and, of course, by now, this Court has 

repeated that so many times that it's a 

well-established background principle against

against you, the better interpretation, you can

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So how much

 would it cost here if you were to lose this

 case?

 MR. SNYDER: So we don't have a

 precise estimate of that, Justice Kavanaugh.  I 

will say that there is a -- a case pending in

 the Seventh Circuit right now that's being held

 for this case in -- in which the plaintiff has

 attempted to assert a -- a class action. 

We understand that the damages if they 

were to prevail would be in the millions of 

dollars.  I don't know exactly what that would 

be, but Congress would have anticipated that the 

potential liability here would be significant, I 

think. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And punitive 

damages too, right? 

MR. SNYDER: So we, of course, don't 

think those would be available.  But I -- I 

think, if you accepted that this is clear enough 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If you accept 

their argument down the line, punitive damages 

could be available? 

MR. SNYDER: That's correct.

 on Employees, you've mentioned that case.  And

 that case seems structurally -- I mean, I'm

 going to ask a lot to the other side about this 

-- seems structurally similar to this statute, 

how this one developed.

 But the other side basically says 

don't pay attention to Employees, and I think

 Justice Sotomayor alluded to that, because it's 

old, a 1973 case.  So I want your response to 

that. 

MR. SNYDER: So, I mean, first, we 

don't think this is how this Court treats 

precedents.  Again, as I said, we think that 

this Court has reaffirmed Employees and -- and 

recognized that Employees began the retreat from 

Parden, but even just looking at the text of 

Employees, I think it's consistent with the 

argument and the distinctions that I'm drawing 

today. 

The Court there said that the cause of 

action by its literal terms covered state 

agencies, but it recognized that the relevant 

question was whether Congress had intend --

intended to bring the states to heel by lifting

 their immunity.  So it recognized that was a 

distinct question, and then it said Congress

 wouldn't have done that silently.

 And, in particular, it said that if 

Congress had intended to do that, it would have

 done one of two things.  It -- it either would 

have addressed immunity expressly, or it would 

have amended the cause of action, and in that

 context, what that would have meant was adding a 

specific reference to state agencies to the 

cause of action. 

And because Congress hadn't done 

either of those things, the Court in Employees 

found there wasn't a clear waiver.  We think the 

same thing is true here. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So then, to pick 

up on Justice Kagan's questions earlier, if you 

see Employees on one side of the line and you 

see cases like Kimel on the other side of the 

line, where the -- where the reference to the 

public entities is in the cause of action 

itself, that's slicing it pretty thin. 

Like, what sense does that make or

MR. SNYDER: So I think, in the cases

 like Kimel, there's a superfluity argument that

 unless you hold that Congress has waived

 sovereign immunity, that text in the cause of 

action will do absolutely no work. And so the

 Court has said Congress wouldn't have 

effectively negated that and has been willing to

 infer a waiver of immunity. 

But Respondent has conceded that our 

interpretation doesn't produce any superfluity 

here. So even if you think that probably 

members of Congress intended to waive sovereign 

immunity, there's no necessary implication that 

they must have.  And under the clear statement 

rule and under Employees, that's enough to rule 

for us. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can you give me 

just one quick example of how it's not 

superfluous --

MR. SNYDER: So --

prevail here?

 MR. SNYDER: So the coverage of 

government ensures that the government can

 obtain credit reports.  I mean, the -- the

I would say here is that when you're talking

 about implications, the -- the cause of action 

doesn't expressly say anything about sovereign 

immunity. So you can only find a waiver by 

thinking that in adopting that cause of action,

 Congress must also have intended to create a

 waiver.

 And if you were a member of Congress 

and you looked at Employees and you said: All 

right, I've got a -- a cause of action that 

applies to a general term, if I define that 

general term somewhere else in a way that it 

covers sovereigns, will that lead to a waiver of 

sovereign immunity. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: So Employees is part 

of the backdrop against which Congress 

legislated in its methodology? 

MR. SNYDER: So, I -- I mean, I think 

it makes it plausible to think that members of 

Congress would not have understood just the bare 

creation of a broad cause of action as 

sufficient to take the analytically distinct 

step of waiving sovereign immunity.

question.  Q is your best argument.  If it

 MR. SNYDER: No.  If -- if it wasn't 

in the statute, we would still have exactly the 

same argument under Employees, and things like 

the fact that 1681n and o would be 

unconstitutional as applied to the states, I 

think, would still give us a --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, unless the

 states waive their sovereign immunity. 

MR. SNYDER: Yes.  I mean, of course, 

you could say the same thing about application 

to federal agencies, that there are some federal 

agencies as to which Congress has waived all 

immunity. 

And so, if you want to just read 1681n 

and o as creating causes of action that apply 

when there's a waiver from someone else --

somewhere else, you can do that with the federal 

government too. 

But my understanding of Respondent's 

argument is that Congress was intending to 

eliminate sovereign immunity in 1681n and o, and 

if that's right, then Congress is acting 

blatantly unconstitutionally with respect to the 

states and didn't say anything at all about the

Seminole Tribe decision from just a few months

 earlier.  We think that's unlikely.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Last question.

 Where are you getting the definition that you 

gave Justice Kagan when she asked you what 

"person" would mean there? Is that just kind of

 what ordinary people would understand?  Is that

 the Dictionary Act?

 MR. SNYDER: It's both.  I mean, I 

think the Dictionary Act definition comports 

with how an informed legal reader would 

understand the word "person" in most places, and 

we think that that -- that understanding makes 

sense in 1681q, so we think it makes sense that 

Congress could have plausibly used it in the 

same sense nearby in n and o.

I mean, it seems to me that what 

happened in Employees, to the extent that there 

was some uncertainty about what Congress did, it 

was because Congress amended the definitions

 section, right, to include governments, and that 

definitions section applied to a whole host of

 things in the statute, the duties, the 

liabilities, or whatnot, and so there was 

palpable uncertainty on the Court's part as to 

whether expanding -- what was it -- employers to 

include government actually affected a waiver of 

liability with respect to the liability section. 

It seems to me here, when we have the 

amendment to the liability section expanding, as 

you conceded previously, the liability section 

to include other entities by use of the term 

"person" that had been previously defined to 

include government, we're actually accomplishing 

a different result. 

It seems to me there isn't the same 

kind of uncertainty in the relevant situation of 

whether or not they intended to expand 

liability, which is what we need for the purpose 

of a waiver. 

Can you comment on that?

MR. SNYDER: Sure.  So -- so two

 things in response.  The first is that I -- I 

think this Court has ordinarily said you just 

look at the statute as it exists. I mean, 

Respondent has said you should look at it as it

 exists today.

           JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's not what 

happened in Employees. So, if we're going to go

 with Employees, which -- which is what you --

you're saying, we're going with that 

methodology, they didn't just do a plain text. 

They were talking about what Congress's intent 

was, isn't it strange that Congress amended it 

and didn't amend the liability provision.  And 

what I'm saying is, here, they did. 

MR. SNYDER: So I -- I think, if you 

want to look at that timing, I think the timing 

actually cuts the other way because, in 

Employ -- in Employees, what Congress was doing 

was taking a statute that already authorized 

civil liability against -- against employers and 

saying we want state agencies to be employers 

for purposes of this statute.  We're going to --

we're going to cover them under the same 

definition that until now has covered all

 employers.

 And so, in that circumstance, it might

 have been reasonable to think that Congress 

intended state agencies to be covered in exactly 

the same way as all other employers because 

Congress was specifically focused on state

 agencies.  And yet --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, but it wasn't

 focused on liability for this purpose. That's 

my only point.  Can I ask you another question? 

I guess I hear you suggesting that 

there has to be an express mention of the 

"federal government" in the provision. So I'm 

wondering, is the government not conceding that 

we have said that you can satisfy the clear 

statement rule by implication? 

MR. SNYDER: No, we accept that you 

can establish it by implication. As the Court 

said in College Savings Bank, it has to be 

"overwhelming implication." 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But -- so an 

implication could occur when what?  In other 

words, it seems to me here that there is no

 available defenses.  No one would think it's 

strange that this cause of action applies to

 private parties that violated FCRA more than 

five years ago. By its plain terms,.

 It absolutely covers them.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I -- I don't

 understand that.  I mean, we're -- we're talking 

-- we start from the standpoint of, has there 

been a waiver of sovereign immunity?  That's the 

question that we're asking to begin with. 

That's why we're engaged in this exercise. 

So, when we start there, I'm not sure 

I understand whether or not there are other 

defenses available doing any work with respect 

to us trying to determine whether sovereign 

immunity has been waived. 

MR. SNYDER: So this Court said in 

Meyer that the question of the -- the cause of 

action and the question of the defense of 

sovereign immunity are analytically distinct.

lines, but, logically, there is an implication

 that Congress intends to waive sovereign

 applies only to sovereign defendants or that

 expressly names sovereign defendants.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So it has to be

 explicit with respect to -- it -- it -- it can't

entities and adding in government.  Is that your 

point? It has to either be stand-alone just the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANDAN M. JOSHI

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. JOSHI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes 

civil liability on any person that negligently 

or willfully fails to comply with FCRA's 

requirements. It expressly defines "person" to 

include any government agency.  The term 

"person" is equivalent to its definition, and

Official 

when FCRA's definition of "person" is plugged 

into FCRA's civil liability provisions, those 

provisions create causes of action against

 federal agencies that are clear and specific

 enough to waive sovereign immunity.

 Congress was not required to state 

that "persons" include federal agencies a second 

time in the cause of action to make its intent

 clear. Congress knew what it was doing when it 

amended FCRA in 1996.  When it did so, it 

consistently used the term "person" to describe 

both who would be subject to FCRA's substantive 

duties and who would be subject to FCRA's 

enforcement mechanisms. 

Interpreting "person" to mean 

something different in the enforcement 

provisions would make FCRA's substantive duties 

completely unenforceable against governmental 

furnishers. 

Moreover, Congress knew how to and did 

choose words to alter the scope of liability 

where it wanted to do so. Thus, where 

Section 1681n generally provides for damages 

against "any person," 1681n(a)(1)(B) creates a 

special remedy for certain violations by a

 1996 as well.

 Congress also expressly limited the

 government's liability in FCRA's sister statutes

 in the Consumer Credit Protection Act. It did 

not do so in FCRA, indicating that Congress 

intended no such limitation.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

like you to address that, what the government 

argued, but I'd also like you to consider 

addressing whether or not the -- what's 

necessary to -- for the government to abrogate 

state sovereign immunity, whether that standard 

is the same as the standard for waiving its own 

sovereign immunity. 

MR. JOSHI: Sure.  So, on Employees, I 

think the best sort of empirical evidence of its 

continuing force are the five courts of appeals 

that have addressed this very issue, the -- the 

question of whether FCRA waives sovereign 

immunity. 

That -- there's a 3-2 circuit split on 

that. The government has raised Employees in

each one of those cases. Not one single court, 

not even the two that agree with the 

government's position, thought Employees was

 worth discussing.  It's -- it's too out -- I --

I suggest that's because it's -- the analysis

 does not comport with how the Court reads

 statutes in the modern era.

 Employees, as I read it, was telling 

Congress how to craft an amendment to make its 

intent clear.  The -- the modern -- the -- sort 

of the current way the Court discerns 

congressional intent is to look at the 

provisions as a whole, the amending provisions, 

as well as the original provisions, and construe 

them together.  And Employees is inconsistent 

with that. 

The other thing to point --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I'm sorry.  I -- I 

-- I don't understand that, really, looking at 

Employees, because it relies on the text of the 

provision and says that because the addition of 

public employees -- employers was in a separate 

definitional provision, that wasn't good enough. 

And then the dissent echoes your 

argument.  Justice Brennan's dissent says that

it's the sheerest sort of ritualism to suggest

 that Congress excluded the states from 16(b) 

suits by not expressly referring to the states

 in 16(b).  In other words, Justice Brennan was 

saying you're being too textualist, majority

 opinion, in -- in how you're going about this. 

And the majority said -- I read it as

 establishing a principle -- well, we're going to

 draw the line here.  If it's just in the 

definitional section, that's not good enough for 

a waiver. 

MR. JOSHI: So Employees started off 

by looking at the legislative history to discern 

what Congress wanted to do when it amended the 

FLSA in -- in 1966. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The -- the 

principle rested on the text.  I mean, I 

acknowledge that then it went on to the 

legislative history.  It might have had an even 

looser standard for waiver of sovereign immunity 

than we now apply.  But, even under that looser 

standard, the Court said no, no waiver. 

MR. JOSHI: Well, the -- the textual

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- you're in

At least I want you to respond to that.

 MR. JOSHI: Sure.  I -- I -- I do

 think the text -- the textual part of Employees,

 which indicated the Court would find it 

surprising, I think that's the exact quote, if 

Congress chose to amend the FLSA but did not 

amend it in this way. Now the Court says that 

Congress does not have -- have to use magic 

words and it doesn't have to use a magic 

structure, I would say, doesn't have to state 

its intent in any particular way. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, do you still 

agree there's a clear statement rule that can 

override the better reading of the text? 

MR. JOSHI: There is a clear statement 

rule. We don't fight that.  I don't think --

MR. JOSHI: Sure.  Well, the other --

one last thing I would point out about Employees 

before I turn to federal versus state is that a 

critical part of Employees was that the 

government could -- the federal government could 

still enforce the FLSA against the states.  The 

government's argument here takes us a step 

further and says no one, not even the federal 

government or the state governments, can enforce 

Employees against any governmental furnishers 

because the term "person" does not apply -- the 

definition of "person" does not apply to 1681s, 

which is the administrative enforcement 

provision.  So this would be a step beyond

 On the federal versus state issue,

 Congress -- I -- I don't think there's a

 different textual standard in this Court's cases

 between waiving sovereign immunity and

 abrogating state immunity.  It's simply that 

what Seminole Tribe and its progeny hold is that

 where there's a conflict between what Congress 

wants and what the state wants, the state wins 

absent -- unless the -- it's in a few discrete 

areas where the Constitution abrogates state 

sovereign immunity or it's a Fourteenth 

Amendment case. 

But, if this statute were in the 

Fourteenth Amendment context, I think this 

language would be sufficient to abrogate state 

sovereign immunity just as it waives federal 

sovereign immunity. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, it --

I think it's an unavoidable consequence of your 

interpretation that the statute authorizes 

criminal prosecution of the United States. 

Now, if there were such a prosecution 

and the United States were convicted, what would 

the pre-sentencing report look like?

 MR. JOSHI: So, as a technical matter,

 I -- I would say the proper defendant in a FCRA 

action would be an agency, not the United States

 itself.  That said, I don't think this Court has

 squarely held how far the federal -- the absence

 of criminal liability for federal -- for

 governmental entities extends.  Last year, in

 Halk Bank, you -- I think you said that criminal 

law can apply to foreign states and their arms. 

I don't -- I don't think you've said that in the 

context of domestic agencies. 

In Bennett versus Spear, you suggested 

that perhaps agencies could be criminally --

criminally liable or civilly liable for failing 

to -- to adhere to a biological opinion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you 

agree that your -- your reading of the statute 

leads to that result, that -- that a criminal 

prosecution can be brought against the United 

States, whether it's through a United States 

agency or the nation as a whole? 

MR. JOSHI: That -- that is one 

reading.  This -- this Court -- I mean, I can't 

say it's absurd since this Court has not said it

-- it's absurd previously.  That said, I -- I --

the easier path I think for this Court would be 

to follow what Judge Katsas said in the D.C. 

Circuit in the Mowrer decision, what Judge 

Krause said below, which is that any contextual

 reason you might have for disregarding an

 otherwise controlling statutory definition in 

the criminal context is unique to the criminal

 context. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but how --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why is that? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- does that work?  I 

mean, n and o and q are all added at the same 

time. We can add s to that too because s raises 

its own anomalies.  They're all -- they're all 

enacted at the same time.  And -- and they're 

all different kinds of liability provisions. 

And you're essentially saying -- and 

you're right that Judge Krause said this below, 

Judge Katsas said it, but you're saying, well, 

you -- you know, it fits with n and o, so we'll 

use one interpretation there.  It doesn't fit 

with q, so we'll use a different interpretation 

there. 

MR. JOSHI: So -- so one correction.

Q stems from the original 1970 act that enacted

 the definition of "person."  The 1996 Act, 

Congress amended the civil liability provision

 and amended the administrative enforcement

 provision to extend -- authorize enforcement

 against persons.  But it didn't -- it didn't add

 in the term "person" in 1681q in 1996.  That's

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

MR. JOSHI: It enhanced the penalties 

in that provision.  With that said, each --

there's no -- I think, well, the civil -- q 

rests as sort of a stand-alone self-contained 

provision.  It doesn't interact with the rest of 

the FC -- the rest of the FCRA in any way. 

It contains its own substantive 

prohibition and its own criminal penalties, 

whereas you have the liability provisions and 

the enforcement provisions, which are designed 

to enforce the substantive --

it's punitive damages against the United States,

 very unusual.  State and federal enforcement 

against the United States would be contemplated

 There's an express waiver in another

 provision that was enacted months earlier, the

Privacy Act is a carefully reticulated scheme

 for imposing liability on the government for 

Privacy Act violations.  They're saying that you

statutorily as persons and that carries 

throughout the whole statute.

 But there may be various provisions in 

which subsets of persons are carved out because

 they have other defenses.  I mean, just because 

"person" is there doesn't mean that, you know,

 every person will automatically and always be 

subject to the entirety of that separate

 provision. 

As the government said, they could 

have separate defenses.  They could have other 

reasons why they're not subject to criminal 

liability even though they're still persons for 

the purpose of the statute. 

So, if that's happening, then the 

government's observation that in certain parts 

of the statute persons are not going to -- to --

or governments, even though they're persons, are 

not going to be subject to that part of the 

statute, it seems to me, doesn't really help 

their argument because, as Justice Gorsuch said, 

we don't see even that happening in n and o, 

which is really all that is at issue here.

provisions away from n and o because there is no 

textual basis in looking at n and o for not 

applying the definition as written.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And there's no real

 basis for suggesting that -- that

 notwithstanding the statute saying that

 "persons" is defined at -- in this way 

throughout the entirety of the provision,

 sometimes it's not really defined this way. 

It seems to me that is an implausible 

reading of the text of the statute that very 

clearly defines the term and says it applies 

everywhere. 

So, if it's not actually operative in 

certain places, it's not because the definition 

has changed.  It's because something else is 

going on that would prevent that consequence 

occurring in that particular circumstance. 

MR. JOSHI: I think that's right.  For 

example, in 1681g, subsection g, Congress has an 

expressed alternative definition of "person" for 

purposes of that provision. That doesn't mean 

somehow n and o become ambiguous in terms of 

where the definition applies.

 only --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- do you think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that you

 think that it's right, but under our sovereign 

immunity precedent, that has to be the only way

 of reading it? 

In other words, there's no other way 

and all these other areas where "person" doesn't 

actually mean person the way it's defined in the 

statute but means much less, and there's not 

just one, there's two, there's three, and you 

have to say that changing the reading of 

"person" is the only way you could read that 

because, if it isn't, then there is -- then 

sovereign immunity, it seems, is implicit in the 

statute in a way that other provisions may not 

be. 

MR. JOSHI: Well, I -- assuming the --

the hypothetical, which is that there are 

variations in what "person" means throughout the 

statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not my 

hypothetical, but go ahead.

MR. JOSHI: Yes.  The -- the fact

 remains, if the Court's going to depart from the

 otherwise controlling definition, it looks to

 something else in the statute that provides a

 countervailing argument.

 For example, Utility Air was brought

 up. The Court looked to provisions of the 

statute that said, if we apply the definition of 

"air pollutant" to these provisions, we have an 

unworkable statute. 

And to the extent you conclude that 

"person" doesn't apply to 1681q because that's 

unworkable or improbable that Congress intended 

to extend criminal liability this far, that is a 

-- that is an argument, an interpretation that 

would be limited to 1681q. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say 

in the statute, but I guess the argument is that 

there can be limitations outside the statute 

that would apply as well. 

And I'm thinking in particular of our 

decision in the Bond case, the -- the -- the 

chemical on the doorknob that is under one 

interpretation, perhaps literal interpretation 

of the statute would be covered by the Chemical

 The Court found -- your -- your opinion for the

And, I mean, I agree that if this statute is 

ambiguous, then the -- the sovereign immunity 

canon favors the government. 

But if -- but the -- the -- there, the

there's nothing "improbably broad" about 

defining "person" to include the government.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I 

would have thought -- sorry to interrupt, but

it's not limitless money in the Treasury, and 

it's to ensure otherwise that taxes aren't

 raised.  So we have to be very careful before we

 overstep, as basic separation of powers.

 Do you dispute any of that?

 MR. JOSHI: Not at all.  You have two 

principles that are designed to protect that

 interest.  One is the sovereign immunity canon.

 So, if the -- a statute is ambiguous, the 

sovereign immunity canon would say even the --

the government gets the benefit of ambiguities 

even if that's not the best reading of the 

statute. 

And the second one is the specificity 

requirement, so a broad statute cannot waive 

sovereign immunity.  The -- the statute must 

discuss governmental entities specifically, 

which the definition here does. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, I guess I'm 

a little confused why -- I mean, I -- I can 

understand that you don't need to make the 

argument to prevail in your view, but I -- I'm

constitutional design, embodied in the Tenth

 Amendment even, for example.

 But, when it comes -- if -- if we're

 worried about protecting the federal fisc, I

 would have thought that the answer might be 

Congress is in the best position to do that. 

Article I gives them power over the federal 

fisc. And we have no license to expand or 

contract its instructions artificially but 

follow them in -- instead faithfully.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What isn't

 sensitive?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why -- why is it

 sensitive?  Focus on that if you could.

 MR. JOSHI: Well, I -- I think the 

Court takes holding the government liable,

 especially for damages, seriously.  So it wants 

-- doesn't want to construe ambiguous text in --

in a way that may be different than Congress 

understood ambiguous text.  But, when the text 

is clear, that's a different matter altogether. 

When there's only one plausible 

interpretation of the text under traditional 

rules of statutory interpretation, the Court 

shouldn't be applying a different interpretation 

of the statute. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Some of our cases have 

suggested that the reason we have a clear 

statement rule is to, in this area, prevent the 

waiver of sovereign immunity accidentally, you 

know, that there has to be -- it can't be 

through inadvertence that Congress has waived 

sovereign immunity. 

So you could look at this statute and

especially the q problem and so forth and say

 that the waiver was -- was accidental, it was 

inadvertent, and that's exactly what the clear 

statement rule tries to prevent. So what would 

-- what -- what would be your best counter to

 that?

 MR. JOSHI: So I have two counters. 

One is about statutory interpretation. One is

 FCRA-specific. 

The first one is I -- I -- I don't see 

how you have a workable principle of statutory 

interpretation that looks behind clear text to 

say, did Congress really mean this? 

So, for example, if the 1996 Act had 

reenacted the definition of "person" word for 

word, if the committee report had said we're 

doing this because we want to make clear the 

government is liable, this -- the words of the 

U.S. Code would be the -- exactly the same. 

But, under a rule that looks behind the text, 

the -- the outcome would be completely 

different. 

And the FCRA-specific argument is -- I 

mean, here, you have a situation, as I mentioned 

in my opening, Congress didn't just sort of make

amended the civil liability provision to extend 

to "persons" in Section 2412 of the 1996 

amendment. On the very next page on the very 

next section, 2413, it used the word "person" to 

extend furnisher obligations onto those who

 And I think it -- it's fairly 

implausible that when Congress turned the page, 

it somehow, using the same word, intended a

this one-off outlier, but then, in subsequent 

cases, like Union Gas, it seems like the same 

principles, accepted by all nine justices there,

 in other words, the specific reference to states 

in the original Act in Union Gas, the Court goes 

out of its way to say that alone -- in the 

definitional provisions, that alone would not 

have been good enough to do it and cites --

 cites Employees. 

And then, in College Savings Bank, the 

Court makes a big point that Employees started 

the retreat from Parden, which was a much looser 

standard for waiver of sovereign immunity.  So 

it's not an out -- you know, it's not just this 

case that has never been cited again. 

MR. JOSHI: It hasn't been cited for 

the statutory interpretation point, I think, 

until -- in any subsequent -- in -- since the 

late '80s.  I think, in -- in Union Gas, you're 

-- you're correct, the statute was written 

differently.  There was additional language in 

the definitions section that -- that -- that was 

dispositive to the Court's analysis there.

question the Court might have to address here, 

which is how viable is that sort of method of

 interpretation.  And --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  By method of

 interpretation -- I just want to get back to

 this because I -- I -- it mentions the text and 

it mentions this principle we don't lightly

 interpret the text to waive sovereign immunity. 

And then there's nothing else that would suggest 

-- in the history of it, suggest a waiver 

either.  I don't -- that sounds like an opinion 

you could write now and has been written now. 

MR. JOSHI: Well, there's nothing in 

Employees that sort of grapples with why the 

statutory definition in that case was not --

does not meet the clear statement standard. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I -- I thought it 

said because the reference to government, to 

public employee -- employers was not in the --

in the cause of action provision. 

MR. JOSHI: Well, that -- that -- if 

that's how Employees is read, then that is 

inconsistent, I would argue that with what the 

Court has said since, which is that Congress can 

state its intent in any way it wants.

And if you simply foreclose use of

 statutory definitions in -- in -- in Congress's

 ability to state -- state its intent, I think --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's a thin line,

 but the line has been between in the cause of 

action provision itself is the explicit

 reference and in a separate definitional

 provision, as in -- as in Employees and

 mentioned in Union Gas as well, that's 

different. 

Now that's a thin line.  I might not 

have come up with that if I were starting from 

scratch, but --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But is it -- is it 

really a line at all? I mean, what if -- what 

if we have the definition provision in -- the 

definition provision next to the cause of action 

provision? 

I mean, here, it's in a, fine.  But 

you can imagine a world in which they write 

1681n and 1 is the provision that says "any 

person willfully," et cetera, and 2 is "person" 

means, and they list out the statute, list out 

the entities.

what the Court's going to do, as it did in Lac

words Congress has given us and we're going to

 interpret it.  If it's ambiguous, the government 

gets the benefit of the doubt. If it's not 

ambiguous, we're going to give the text its 

plain meaning. 

And -- and this text is not ambiguous. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Do -- do you -- do 

you take any stock on the amendment history?  I 

mean, you know, I -- I appreciate the plain 

meaning, we just look at the statute and see 

what it says, and maybe, in that world, it is 

parallel to Employees. 

But Employees seemed to put some stock 

in the amendment history as it analyzed what was

action.

 question is -- are -- how do we -- how -- how 

and whether we should be implying some kind of

 intention on Congress's part to extend the cause 

of action to government, is the amendment 

history relevant at all?

 MR. JOSHI: Well, I think it 

definitely is relevant that Congress amended the

 cause -- cause of action. Even if you take 

Employees at face value, that should be 

sufficient.  I think the other things that go 

along with that are the fact that Congress 

amended the cause of action at the same time it 

imposed substantive duties on governments. 

And I think the other thing to keep in 

mind is that governments are not strangers to 

the FCRA.  The -- Congress accommodates the 

government's interests throughout the statute, 

creating exemptions for them, for example, in 

the national security area, exemptions in terms 

of the adverse action response requirements that 

apply to persons, the government has -- in 

the -- in the -- in the context of national 

security, Congress has created an exemption for 

them.

 include the government.  Could you just give me 

your best answer to the argument that n and o

 should be treated the same way?

 MR. JOSHI: N and o deal with civil

 "person" consistently to include the government. 

It's a different context entirely.

MR. JOSHI: We would -- if -- if 

that -- if the case were before me, I would say 

it includes the government because Congress did 

not create an exemption like it did in the Truth 

in Lending Act for governmental criminal 

liability.

MR. JOSHI: But, I mean, I -- I would 

say the better reading is to apply the statute

 as written.  If there are problematic

 applications in a particular criminal 

proceeding, a court can deal with that at that

 time. The court doesn't -- usually doesn't 

avoid a plain language reading of the statute to

 avoid -- to avoid potential pitfalls down the 

line if that's what the statute says. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 

MR. JOSHI: However, the Court doesn't 

have to address, I think, the complicated 

question of criminal liability because --

because of the alternative that was adopted 

below, which is -- which is to say the concerns 

are unique to the criminal context and do not 

apply to civil liability or the substantive 

duties of FCRA.

there's some plausible readings of "person" that

MR. JOSHI: Well, you would address it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W. SNYDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SNYDER: Thank you.  A few quick 

points. 

First, Justice Kagan -- as -- as 

Justice Kagan suggested, one of the purposes for 

the clear statement rule is to make sure that 

Congress has specifically considered the 

question of whether it wants to waive sovereign 

immunity and addressed that. 

One of the reasons to require specific 

references to sovereign entities in the cause of 

action itself is to make sure that Congress has 

made that conscious decision.

Now my friend acknowledged that there

 is a specificity requirement.  He just thinks 

that it's satisfied here in the Act-wide

 definition.  The problem with that understanding

 is that it -- it asks for specificity about the

 wrong thing.

 The definition that Congress adopted 

in 1970 does make clear that in some references, 

the FCRA does cover the government, but it 

doesn't make clear that Congress was 

specifically focused on waiving Congress -- the 

United States' sovereign immunity because it had 

nothing to do with liability at the time it was 

adopted. 

There was also a suggestion that 

perhaps the word "person" means every -- or 

means the same thing in all parts of the 

statute, but there are just defenses that exist 

under the criminal provision perhaps that would 

exempt the government from liability there. 

We think that's right. We just think 

that the same thing is true with 1681n and o, 

that the fact that "person" in those provisions 

might include the sovereign does not answer the 

separate question of whether the sovereign has

defenses to civil liability any more than it 

answers the question of whether the sovereign

 might have defenses to criminal liability.

 And, finally, my friend tried to

 distinguish Employees.  I -- I think, as Justice

 Kavanaugh alluded to, his arguments sound a lot 

like the dissent in Employees, which accused the 

majority opinion of engaging in ritualism by 

focusing very carefully on exactly what was and 

was not in the statutory text. But, of course, 

this Court's decisions today focus the -- follow 

the approach that the majority took there, not 

the dissent. 

And -- and one other distinction that 

he attempted to draw was that in Employees, the 

statute allowed for enforcement by the FTC. 

But, of course, that's Respondent's position as 

well. He thinks that FCRA is enforceable by the 

FTC. 

So, if you decide that "person" 

includes the United States throughout the rest 

of the Act, FCRA is on all fours with Employees, 

and -- and we would win even on that -- that 

understanding. 

Thank you.
