 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-721,

 McElrath versus Georgia.

 Mr. Simpson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SIMPSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SIMPSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The most fundamental principle of 

double jeopardy law, going back hundreds of 

years before even the adoption of the 

Constitution, is that if a jury in a court with 

jurisdiction returns a verdict of acquittal, 

that that verdict is final.  It may not be --

the defendant may not be subjected to a second 

prosecution ever, no questions, end of 

discussion. 

This case is the paradigm in which 

that example applies or that principle applies. 

Mr. McElrath went to trial before a jury in 

Georgia.  The jury found him not guilty of 

malice murder by reason of insanity.  No one has 

questioned that that jury deliberated in

 accordance with Georgia processes.  It returned

 a verdict in return -- in accordance with 

Georgia processes. The State and the defendant 

both affirmatively indicated they had no

 objection to the form of the verdict.  The court

 accepted it and entered judgment.  According, 

that is the end of it as far as the malice

 murder charge is concerned.

 The State contends that Mr. McElrath 

can be subject -- subjected to a second trial 

because that acquittal is repugnant to a 

conviction on separate offenses. And this 

Court's analysis has always been offense by 

offense.  He was found guilty but mentally ill 

as to felony murder and guilty but mentally ill 

as to aggravated assault.  This repugnant 

verdict exception to the double jeopardy 

principle does not stand, cannot withstand 

analysis. 

The State really makes two arguments. 

The first is that this Court's inconsistent 

verdict cases do not apply because they're --

there's a difference between a repugnant verdict 

and an inconsistent verdict and, in particular, 

that with a repugnant verdict, there is no

uncertainty as to what the jury did.

 That is wrong as a factual matter 

because the uncertainty is the same, but, more 

importantly, it does not matter because an

 acquittal is final regardless.  There -- it does 

not matter why the jury reached that conclusion. 

The acquittal is final and conclusive.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So your client filed 

a motion to vacate the -- the conviction as 

repugnant.  What is the effect when -- when a 

verdict is determined to be repugnant?  What's 

the effect of that? 

MR. SIMPSON: Well, this Court has 

held in --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, I mean the 

Georgia -- court. 

MR. SIMPSON: In Georgia?  In Georgia, 

before this case -- and the Turner case in the 

Georgia Supreme Court was -- is the leading 

example -- the acquittal would stand and the 

conviction would be vacated. 

In this case, the Georgia Supreme 

Court for the first time held that both the 

acquittal and the conviction should be vacated.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think the -- if I 

understand the opinion below correctly, the

 Georgia Supreme Court says that because of the 

repugnancy there was no verdict. And that's

 what I'm trying to understand.

 If you -- if -- with respect to your 

motion earlier, was it your goal, was the

 argument that the verdict was void because it 

was repugnant or simply that it should be 

vacated because it was repugnant? 

MR. SIMPSON: Our argument was that 

the conviction should be vacated -- the 

convictions should be vacated because they were 

repugnant.  Neither side in the -- in McElrath I 

raised any question about the acquittal 

standing.  So, on appeal, we argued to the 

Georgia Supreme Court you should throw out the 

conviction.  But neither side argued that the 

acquittal was in question. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- as a 

general matter, do you agree that it's a matter 

of state law when jeopardy terminates?  Because 

that's the -- that's the -- that's the basic 

question, right, whether the defendant is being 

put in jeopardy more than once.  So you have to

have the first jeopardy terminate before you can 

get to the question of whether it -- or not he's

 in jeopardy a second time.  As a general matter,

 is that a question of state law?

 MR. SIMPSON: As a general matter, 

yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but that is subject to 

this Court making the ultimate determination as 

to what constitutes an acquittal. This Court 

has held that jeopardy terminates when there is 

an acquittal.  And so, within broad ranges, the 

state has discretion, subject to constitutional 

limitations, due process, speedy trial, et 

cetera, to set procedures. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if one of 

the procedures is that the verdict form has to 

be signed by the jury foreman, okay, and the 

jury reaches a verdict, you know, 12 -- 12 to 

nothing or whatever, that the defendant is not 

guilty, but the jury foreman, you know, as he's 

presenting the verdict or whatever, decides, you 

know -- you know, I'm -- I'm -- I -- I -- I have 

second thoughts, I'm not going to sign it? So, 

as a matter of state law, is that verdict --

terminate the first jeopardy or not? 

MR. SIMPSON: No, because that -- the

 Georgia Supreme Court opinions acknowledge this 

-- is that there was not one verdict; there were

 verdicts.  No one questions there were verdicts. 

And to determine that that verdict was void, the 

-- the -- the acquittal, the Georgia Supreme 

Court looked at the acquittal, looked at the 

conviction, compared the two after the fact, and 

concluded that they were repugnant and, 

therefore, declared them to be void.  The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So would --

you would say the question before us is whether 

Georgia as a matter of state law can say that a 

verdict -- that -- that jeopardy has not 

terminated until, for example, they determine 

that the verdicts are not repugnant? 

They draw a distinction between 

inconsistent verdicts, on which, of course, we 

already have established law, and repugnant 

verdicts. So, I mean, what if they have a 

system where, once the jury has reached a 

verdict, it's not effective for a week to give

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that seems to

 make the rule that you're asking us for, you

 know, pretty insignificant, right, if -- if we 

come out of this case and it turns out that when 

the jury form is given to the judge, the judge 

can look at it and say, no, I don't think so, 

that looks inconsistent, that looks repugnant,

 whatever word you want to put on it, go back and

 try it again. 

You know, then -- then -- then, in the 

next case, the judge is just going to do that, 

and so this will be a one-case-only sort of 

ruling. 

MR. SIMPSON: And, Justice Kagan, that 

is not our position.  Our position is that once 

the jury returns the verdict, that -- that that 

double jeopardy protection is triggered, that 

the jeopardy has ended. 

I wanted to make the point that 

there's a distinction, that's not what happened 

here, but we believe that once the jury has 

returned the verdict and there is an acquittal, 

that's the end of it. The judge may not send it 

back.

 double jeopardy precedent from this Court or, 

for that matter, from lower federal courts 

saying that a state cannot have a procedure like 

the Missouri procedure? 

MR. SIMPSON: The repugnant -- oh, oh, 

the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  A state can't have a 

rule that says the trial judge is not to accept 

inconsistent verdicts --

MR. SIMPSON: I am not --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- or repugnant 

verdicts.  That's a violation of double 

jeopardy. 

MR. SIMPSON: I -- I'm -- I'm not 

aware of a case directly on point on that issue. 

The principle, I think, would be the same as --

as raised here.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Another related

 question.  This is my other point of concern

 about this case.  You seem to agree in your

 reply brief or at least you don't contest the 

proposition that if a jury returns inconsistent 

verdicts or repugnant verdicts on the same 

count, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not 

prohibit the judge from saying, no, you can't do

 that, go back and deliberate some more. 

Is that a violation -- is that 

correct, that's not a violation of double 

jeopardy? 

MR. SIMPSON: If -- if, in your -- in 

your hypothetical, from those inconsistent 

verdicts one cannot ascertain whether there has 

been an acquittal or a conviction, then we 

believe that is distinguishable. 

And -- and going back to your earlier 

question, going back again to 1896 and Ball, 

this Court did hold that the return of the 

verdict terminated jeopardy, notwithstanding 

that the indictment was -- was invalid 

ultimately.  So I think that's -- is -- is close 

to on point. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Did --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- what principle 

distinguishes -- one more question along these

 lines. What principle distinguishes the

 situation where there are inconsistent jury

 determinations on one count from the situation 

where there are logically irreconcilable jury

 determinations on two counts?

 I -- I don't -- maybe there's a 

principle that explains that.  Other than a --

a -- a -- a formal difference, I don't really --

it doesn't jump out at me why that should be 

different. 

MR. SIMPSON: Now, the -- the 

difference, Justice Alito, is that double 

jeopardy has always been analyzed on an 

offense-by-offense basis.  So the question is --

is, was there a verdict on the particular 

offense? 

And if what the jury returns does not 

show that there has been a verdict, you can't 

tell what the jury determined, then it's 

appropriate to ask them to delay -- deliberate 

further.

 two verdicts and say we're going to compare the

 jury's findings on this count with its findings

have a multi-count indictment, it's still 

offense by offense.  And the logical principle, 

it's -- it's a different crime.

 deliberations, right?

 MR. SIMPSON: Yes, Justice Jackson, 

and that's exactly why we propose this test of 

looking at the contents. What the State can't

 do and what -- what it's -- is seeking to do 

here is to look at the contents of the jury's

 findings on two different crimes and say we're 

going to compare those after the fact and throw 

out the acquittal. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But how is it 

different from Justice Gorsuch's question to say 

the defendant's both guilty and not guilty, and 

then, in the next case, the jury says the 

defendant's both sane and not sane? 

MR. SIMPSON: The -- the difference is 

that those verdicts in the second example are on 

separate offenses.  And so it's like -- it's no 

different than one of the cases this Court has 

dealt with, the defendant is convicted of 

conspiracy to possess cocaine but acquitted of 

possession of cocaine.  That's impossible.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And we allow -- I

 guess the principle, we allow juries to 

compromise in ways that are maybe not completely 

logical, but when it gets down to one count, 

they can't do guilty and not guilty. That's not

because insanity is an affirmative defense in 

Georgia, the defendant has to prove it by a 

preponderance of the evidence, and, here, there 

was one single episode.

 Now, on different facts -- and -- and, 

in fact, the Georgia Supreme Court in -- in 

McElrath talks about a different case in which

 you could be sane -- a -- a defendant could be

 sane and insane at -- at different times.  I 

believe that one was shooting one person and 

then going down the hall --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah. 

MR. SIMPSON: -- and shooting a 

different person.  But, here, it -- it --

because the issue is the affirmative defense, 

it's exactly the same as to the three charges. 

The point again, though, is the jury 

can go back -- can nullify, and we don't know 

why they did what they did.  It could just as --

the uncertainty is the same.  We don't know why 

they found him sane on one count and insane on 

the other, just like we don't know why the jury 

convicted on possession with intent to sell but 

not on possession.

MR. SIMPSON: Okay.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- but I guess what 

I'm saying is there, you know, the -- the judge 

just waits, but the rule says, you know, at six 

hours, it's a line, it's a mistrial, but the

 jury does still come back and return a verdict 

of acquittal.  It's just that it violates this 

procedural requirement. 

Which side of the line does that fall 

on? I mean, the jury's returned a verdict of 

acquittal, but state law says it just doesn't 

count if the jury's deliberated for more than 

six hours. 

MR. SIMPSON: Well, one of the 

interests protected by the Double Jeopardy 

Clause is the defendant's right to have a 

decision by the jury that's empaneled.  And so I 

think the question would be, is a six-hour 

period that automatically triggers a mistrial so 

unreasonable that, in fact, violates double 

jeopardy?

 would be the issue.  The -- can a state deprive 

the defendant of his right, her right, to have a 

decision by the particular jury that was

 empaneled?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So what kinds of 

procedural requirements can a state impose?

 MR. SIMPSON: They have very broad

 discretion, as I said, subject to due process 

and right to jury trial, et cetera, but 

evidentiary, we don't -- if you look at the 

amicus brief here, we don't question evidentiary 

rule -- rules can be set. Does the -- all of 

the jurors sign the form or just the foreperson? 

Do you poll the jury?  Hours that are 

deliberated?  All -- all of those procedural 

points. 

And the test that we think captures it 

is looking at the contents, and that -- that's 

the red line that the State crossed here, is 

that they acknowledged -- the -- the Georgia

state law as determined by Georgia's highest

 court. Under Georgia's narrow, sensible 

repugnancy rule, a jury cannot issue special

 affirmative findings that facially contradict

 each other.  These incoherent, contradictory 

statements do not constitute a verdict in the

 first place.  They don't resolve the factual

 inquiry.

 In practice, this rule means a jury 

cannot declare a man both sane and insane at the 

exact same time with respect to the exact same 

act, as the jury purported to do here. That's 

why the Georgia Supreme Court held there was no 

verdict, no acquittal, and no convictions. 

McElrath does not challenge that 

underlying Georgia Supreme Court decision, 

which, of course, benefited him, and he doesn't 

explain why we should ignore it now, why we 

should assume that there was a verdict, even 

though state law tells us there wasn't. 

To the contrary, you have to look to 

the underlying state law to identify whether 

there is some final verdict or judicial order 

that could even potentially terminate jeopardy 

in the first place.  And, here, because there's

no verdict, there's no termination of jeopardy, 

then the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't apply.

 Now other states can have different

 rules about verdicts, but I think that Georgia's

 repugnancy rule, if anything, is the most 

sensible way of responding to a very rare set of

 circumstances.  It's a generally pro-defendant

 rule that ensures the parties obtain an actual

 determination of the critical facts.  And the 

critical fact of McElrath's sanity was not 

determined here.  Therefore, he can be retried. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

charge here, malice murder, would there have

that up to that point, until you void the 

verdict, you have what constitutes a verdict.

 It's not procedurally defective.  There's not a

 jurisdictional problem.  You have a verdict that 

is subsequently voided because it's inconsistent

 with a separate charge.

 And I don't know how you get around

 the notion -- and -- and that requires you, by 

the way, to look at the substance of the 

verdict.  And I don't know how you get around 

the notion that before you can do that, there 

actually is a verdict. 

MR. PETRANY: Well, no, Your Honor, to 

be clear, here, in this case, there was never a 

verdict because, again, the jury issued 

something simultaneously.  It said at the same 

time, speaking out of both sides of its mouth, 

he's both sane and insane at the same time. 

And these were special findings.  As 

we explain in our brief, there's a big 

distinction between a jury coming back with a --

you know, a general verdict of not guilty, 

which, you know, a jury has the authority to --

to do that for any reason or no reason at all --

you're saying the jury was asked is this person 

insane, and their answer was simply yes in one

 situation or with respect to one count and no

 with respect to the other.

 But the jury was asked about the 

elements of a particular crime and whether he 

was guilty or not guilty. So their verdict was 

not guilty by reason of insanity with respect to 

one of them and guilty, right --

MR. PETRANY: Well, Yes, Your Honor, 

but --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- with respect to 

the other? 

MR. PETRANY: -- but not guilty by 

reason of insanity by definition means that you 

did commit the crime and the only reason that we 

have said you're not guilty is because you are, 

in fact, insane. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I understand.

in the way you sort of set it up at the

 beginning.

 MR. PETRANY: Well, actually, as a

 practical matter, Your Honor, I think that --

that they were.  I mean, this -- even setting

 aside the -- the more mundane aspects of this 

case where the entire trial was about sanity,

 they were given a special verdict form that has

 four options.  The judge did, in fact, instruct 

them that they could say not guilty. They 

always had that authority. 

So it's not like Georgia is somehow 

trying to force the jury into, you know, giving 

up its general power to just say not guilty for 

any reason.  And part of the -- the reason that 

we think this case is different from, you know, 

the in -- you know, the seemingly facially 

inconsistent verdict cases is precisely because, 

in this case, the jury didn't do that.  It 

actually made special determinations about --

 substance and without looking into how they fit 

with other counts and said a jury is a check on 

judges, it's a check on prosecutors, it's a

 check on overreach, it's part of our democratic 

system, and we do not ever talk about whether

 they make sense to us.

 They may be products of compromise. 

They may be inconsistent with verdicts on other 

counts.  We don't question them. And this is 

the first time this issue has arisen here. 

Shouldn't that tell us something? 

MR. PETRANY: I don't think so, Your 

Honor. As we point out in our briefs, the fact 

that Georgia has a different rule from other 

states -- and, again, I would hasten to add it's 

not clear that the rule is different so much as 

other states just haven't addressed this issue. 

In a lot of states, you might not have 

the same sort of defenses or states of mind that 

would so easily come into conflict, although, 

again, here, I think this is a rare 

circumstance.

They had the option to do that, and, instead,

 they gave completely contradictory answers about

that raises the question about Missouri's brief,

 Here, we're dealing with not -- not

Court has talked about this and every time the 

Court has made rulings about this, it's always 

talking about a general verdict of acquittal. 

It's not talking about a circumstance 

where you have special findings that did not 

have the same sort of status, the same sort of

isn't an acquittal if it's a special verdict

 form?

 MR. PETRANY: No, what I'm saying is 

it's not an acquittal if the jury did not, in

 fact, resolve the factual question that

 supposedly underlies that acquittal.  And in

 this particular case, we know because they said

 two contradictory things that they didn't, in 

fact, resolve that particular factual point. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  We also know that 

the jury was polled.  They stood by this 

verdict.  We know that there were no objections 

contemporaneously by Georgia prosecutors.  And I 

think we also know that the attorney general at 

least below said that acquittal is an acquittal. 

MR. PETRANY: Well, no.  What the 

attorney -- well, the -- what the brief below 

said -- and it was a tangential footnote that 

really wasn't getting into the issue -- is that 

where there's an acquittal, double jeopardy 

applies.  And we're not contesting that at all, 

much like McElrath here today and throughout his 

briefing, he just sort of assumed --

Petitioner on the murder count would, of course,

 violate double jeopardy.

 MR. PETRANY: Assume -- yeah, on the

 basis that there was an acquittal.  But that

 brief didn't really get into that issue.  And 

the primary brief in the case, the -- the DA 

brief, did reject that particular position.

 But I'd also say, going back to, well, 

did Georgia, you know, have a problem with this 

at the time, well, no, because Georgia wanted 

everything to stay the way it was, of course. 

From Georgia's perspective, from the 

prosecution's perspective, it was -- it got what 

it wanted, right?  There was, in fact, a -- a --

accept these as verdicts, to the extent you

if there is a verdict, the rule doesn't really

special about a general verdict of not guilty.

 the -- the exact same thing really. I mean,

 when -- when a jury comes back with inconsistent

 verdicts, we don't really know what happened.  I

 mean, one possibility of what happened is the

 jury made a humdinger of a mistake.

 And another possibility of what 

happened is that the jury made no mistake at all 

but instead decided to compromise something out 

or decided to show leniency of a kind that it is 

within the right of a jury to show. And so too 

here, the jury might have made a humdinger of a 

mistake in the way that you're suggesting, but, 

in addition, the jury might have decided to 

compromise things out or to show leniency. 

And in that sense, we would be 

intruding into the jury's deliberations as much 

in your case as in the inconsistency cases if we 

adopted your rule.

don't think that that's true, Justice Kagan, is,

guilty and we're not going to tell you why.

 But, in this circumstance, although 

the jury had the authority to do that, was 

instructed on doing that, they didn't do that. 

Instead, they came out and said: We think he's 

sane and insane at the same time. 

So I do think that that's a -- that's 

a fundamentally different out -- you know, issue 

from the jury. And I think, when a court looks 

at that and says, actually, you've decided the 

same issue in two different ways, I think it is 

a bit legally fictitious to say: Well, they 

were really deciding two different factual 

issues. 

I mean, I know it's a -- at least a 

little bit legally fictitious because, you know, 

the -- this Court, you know, applies collateral 

estoppel rules to jury findings on a particular 

count. So we all acknowledge that there really 

is one fact that's being decided here, which is 

his insanity at the time of the crime, and the

jury said yes and no.

 And just -- just to give one example 

of why I think McElrath's argument here is -- is 

a little bit formalistic, suppose the jury form

 were slightly different and suppose it had an 

option for guilt and then it had a different 

option for insanity, and they said guilty on all

 counts on insanity -- or on -- on the guilt

 question, but then, on insanity, they said yes 

and no.  I mean, that's -- that's the same 

circumstance that we're in here. It's -- it's 

not fundamentally different.  It's a jury not 

actually deciding whether or not they have come 

to a conclusion.  That --

-- you're guilty as sin, all the facts are 

there, but we don't care, we're going to hold --

say not guilty anyway.

 So you can never know that what they 

did was factually inconsistent. They might have 

just said, yeah, you did it all, but we're going 

to let you off on this particular count. So I

 think it's just a matter of -- of logic.  You 

can never know that two general verdicts are 

absolutely inconsistent with one another. 

That's why in our brief we refer to it 

as kind of seemingly inconsistent, but because 

the jury could be deciding this on a totally 

non-factual basis, you can't know that they're 

actually inconsistent. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But wasn't Justice 

Gorsuch's point that even if we know that they 

are inconsistent, so what? I mean -- the -- the 

point is that we've said a jury can issue 

inconsistent verdicts.  So your -- your argument 

seems to be, well, there's -- the distinction 

that Justice Kagan was asking you about is that 

in one situation, we don't know it's 

inconsistent, and in another situation, this 

situation, we do know.

Okay. I mean, fine.  So it's

 inconsistent.  Why -- why does that mean that

 the court gets to say you aren't able to do

 that, jury?  You -- you know, you can retry this 

person or you have to set it up so he can be 

retried because that's not a valid thing for the

 jury to do. 

MR. PETRANY: Well, two points, Your

 Honor. The first is it's not -- you know, I'm 

not speaking from nothing when I say that the 

inconsistent verdicts cases are different 

because we don't know what the jury has done. 

This is what the Court has said. We don't know 

what the jury has done. 

But the second reason is I think the 

reason that the jury can issue a -- a verdict of 

not guilty, a general verdict of not guilty, and 

a state can't say, oh, that's not really a 

verdict because it -- it may or may not be 

inconsistent with this other one is because of 

the right to a jury trial and the fact that, as 

this Court has explained on numerous occasions, 

a jury always has that authority. A state can't 

say you don't have the authority to issue this 

general verdict of not guilty.

brief, I don't think McElrath even denies --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess my question

 is why --

MR. PETRANY: -- that with special

 verdicts --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I -- I guess my

 question is why is it -- and I think your 

argument is turning on this -- that a state can 

tell the jury they have to be factually 

consistent?  So, even if I accept your 

distinction that you are drawing with Justice 

Kagan in that -- you know, in this particular 

world, we have evidence that there's a factual 

inconsistency with respect to the way they 

rendered their verdicts, why is it okay for the 

state to say you can't do that? 

MR. PETRANY: Again, two points, Your 

Honor. The first is I think that as a matter of 

sensibility, the jury is supposed to find facts. 

If they don't find the facts, if they instead 

tell you two opposite things, it makes a lot of 

sense to say the jury has not, in fact, found 

this fact.

McElrath's burden to identify why a state can't

 do this.  It is the strong presumption that a

 state does have authority over its own criminal

 laws and procedures.  And unless there's

 something in the, you know, kind of fundamental

 right to a jury trial or something like this --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't it the

 Constitution?  I mean, I thought -- I -- I -- I

 guess my question is, isn't there -- isn't this 

a matter of federal law as to whether or not 

what is happening here is an acquittal or not an 

acquittal for the purpose of the Double Jeopardy 

Clause? 

MR. PETRANY: So what a state order or 

finding or something like that, the effect that 

it has for the purposes of double jeopardy is 

ultimately a federal question.  But what the 

state order is and whether it exists in the 

first place, that's not necessarily a federal 

question.  And I would point the Court to Smith 

versus Massachusetts and Sattazahn versus 

Pennsylvania. 

In Smith versus Massachusetts, the 

Court did hold that this mid-trial judicial 

acquittal triggered the Double Jeopardy Clause,

 this wasn't a final order, that it could be 

revisited, that they could come back to it 

later, well, then it wouldn't trigger double

 jeopardy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so then 

-- well, what if the state had a rule that the 

foreman has to sign the verdict in blue ink, all 

right, and he signed it in -- in black ink, and 

the judge -- you know, it's supposed to be blue 

ink; go back. He goes back, and then one of the 

jurors changes their mind.  Is that rule of 

state law sufficient to constitute a 

determination of when jeopardy was terminated?

guess the argument would be, even in the context 

of your understanding, that it's the only state

 that has done this in 230 years, and maybe

 that's outside the -- or -- normal

 understanding.

 MR. PETRANY: Yeah, so that is -- at

 the very least, that's the right kind of

 argument that McElrath should be making here,

 but I -- the reason I reject that is because, 

first of all, I don't -- I don't accept the 

notion that no other state has ever had a rule 

anything like this. 

It's true that no other state appears 

to have actually come across facts exactly like 

this, but we point to examples in our brief, and 

the Missouri amicus brief has others of kind of 

similar situations, where they do, in fact, have 

rules that appear at least similar or analogous 

to -- to our rule here. 

And we also point to cases like in the 

Morgan article from before the founding where --

where cases -- especially where special verdicts 

seemed to be inconsistent with even general 

verdicts of --

a general verdict, but couldn't the inconsistent 

or repugnant special findings be the product of

 compromise or leniency?

 MR. PETRANY: Well, I think that this

 goes back to my answer to Justice Kagan earlier, 

which is we don't look behind what the jury did

 to sort of understand their motivation.  So they 

issued special verdicts that are completely 

incomprehensible when put together. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But they could --

couldn't they be the product -- I guess, to go 

back to my question, couldn't they be the 

product of compromise or leniency? 

MR. PETRANY: Yeah, they could have --

I mean, what the jury did, I have no idea. I 

wasn't in the room.  And that's kind of the 

point. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But it -- but it 

could be compromise? 

MR. PETRANY: It's at least 

theoretically possible that the -- the jury 

wanted to do something like be lenient or 

something like this.  But the reason that a

 really you're saying that the jury doesn't have 

a right to do leniency and compromise?

 MR. PETRANY: No, Your Honor, they

 obviously do and they could have in this case

 with a general verdict of not guilty.  But, to 

be clear, when they issued this, you know, 

purported verdict, assume you accept it, it has 

consequences for McElrath. 

So it -- the -- the idea that the jury 

can, you know, consign him to a mental health 

hospital until he is, you know, determined not 

to be dangerous anymore as sort of some version 

of leniency I think is getting way outside of 

the ordinary general verdict of not guilty as 

the jury's ultimate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm

leniency, whatever.

A general verdict is are you guilty or

whatever special defenses.  And almost always 

you had is he guilty by reason of insanity or 

not. That's what they did here, right, on the

Smith last year, we said an acquittal takes

 place when there is a merits-related

Here, the jury was given malice 

murder.  Some of the fact -- one of the factual 

elements is the mental state, guilty by reason 

of insanity or not.  They said not.  I don't 

know how this doesn't fit Smith's definition of 

what an acquittal is.

jury did.  And the jury said not guilty by

charge with a potential inconsistency that you

 now admit could have been by reason of jury

 compromise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly,

 counsel.

 MR. PETRANY: Yeah, Your Honor, I 

don't think states are prohibited from trying to

 avoid incomprehensible compromises.  I think 

it's just leniency that they have to leave in 

there with general verdicts of not guilty. 

As far as whether this is a special 

verdict or not, the Georgia Supreme Court 

understood it that way.  McElrath understood it 

that way.  You know, that was the basis of his 

argument all the way along, including in his 

plea and bar in this case. 

And so the big difference ultimately 

is that the jury always has the authority to 

just say not guilty, we don't want you to be 

guilty of this crime.  I don't think there's any 

historical or other support for the idea that a 

jury must have the authority to issue 

incomprehensible special findings. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If you do not 

prevail in this case, I have two questions.  One 

is, can't Georgia going forward solve the 

problem that you've identified by simply saying 

that the guilty verdicts stand even if 

repugnant? 

MR. PETRANY: Yes.  So, if we were to 

lose this case, I think not only could they, but 

that is the only logical thing for the Georgia 

Supreme Court to do because the basis of this 

rule was there are no verdicts at all.

 Georgia accepts the basic idea that if 

-- if these are seemingly inconsistent, we'll

 just -- we'll just accept them as they are.

 The basis for this rule was we don't

 think these are verdicts at all. If this Court 

says, yeah, they are, then I think basically 

whether McElrath or the next person in his shoes 

is just going to be stuck with the

 life-in-prison conviction. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Is that still 

possible in this case? 

MR. PETRANY: I -- yes, I think so. I 

mean, obviously, it's going to be up to the 

Georgia Supreme Court to figure out what to do 

going forward, but the initial decision was 

based on the idea that there was no verdict 

here. 

And so, if this Court were to vacate 

and remand and say, no, there was a verdict 

here, then we -- I -- presumably, the Georgia 

Supreme Court would at least take seriously the 

argument of, okay, well, then we just reinstate 

the judgment because the United States Supreme 

Court just said there was a verdict. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

 Mr. Simpson, rebuttal.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SIMPSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SIMPSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court: 

Justice Thomas, you're exactly right 

that under Georgia law, each of these counts, if 

it had been charged separately, would -- at --

at the verdict would be a final verdict under 

state law. It's only by comparising them --

comparing them that you get to repugnancy. 

It is true that Mr. McElrath appealed 

in this case.  He had the right to do that under 

Georgia law.  And going to Justice Kavanaugh's 

question, under Powell, states may, as the 

federal government does when there are 

inconsistent acquittals and convictions, may 

allow the -- the conviction to stand. They 

can't touch the appeal.  It's "may," not "must." 

Many states throw out the conviction.  It's --

it's a state choice at that level.

And there was the -- the -- the 

Georgia Supreme Court in the Turner case in 

2006, I believe, dealt with what it had said is

 repugnant verdicts, and it did exactly that.  It 

let the acquittal stand, but it vacated the --

 threw out the conviction.

 We would hope that Georgia would 

continue to follow that rule. It'll be its

 decision, but there's nothing about a decision 

by this Court that would require Georgia to 

change its rule.  And in the -- in the context 

of Turner, it reached exactly the result of 

allowing the -- the acquittal to stand and 

throwing out the conviction. 

In -- in terms of repugnancy, I -- I 

think the key point, as the questions indicated, 

there really isn't a principal difference. 

Here, Mr. McElrath was acquitted of the most 

serious charge, convicted of the lesser charge. 

Could have been leniency, could have been 

compromise.  We don't -- we don't know why the 

court reached -- I'm sorry, the jury reached 

that verdict. 

And then, finally, the reference to 

issue preclusion.  Where there's a conviction
