 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 23-235, the Food 

and Drug Administration versus Alliance for

 Hippocratic Medicine, and the consolidated case.

 General Prelogar.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

FDA approved mifepristone based on the 

agency's scientific judgment that the drug is 

safe and effective.  It's maintained that 

judgment across five presidential 

administrations, and millions of Americans have 

used mifepristone to safely end their 

pregnancies.  Respondents may not agree with 

that choice, but that doesn't give them Article 

III standing or a legal basis to upend the 

regulatory scheme. 

At the outset, Respondents lack 

standing.  They now concede they can't rely on a 

statistical theory of injury like the lower 

courts did.  Instead, they have to identify a

 specific doctor who faces imminent harm.

 But their theories rest on a long

 chain of remote contingencies.  Only an

 exceptionally small number of women suffer the

 kind of serious complications that could trigger

 any need for emergency treatment.  It's 

speculative that any of those women would seek

 care from the two specific doctors who asserted

 conscience injuries.  And even if that happened, 

federal conscience protections would guard 

against the injury the doctors face. 

And there's no basis to conclude that 

any of that would be traceable to the 

incremental changes that FDA made in 2016 and 

2021 as opposed to the availability of 

mifepristone in general.  Respondents' theories 

are too attenuated as a matter of law. The 

Court should say so and put an end to this case. 

If the Court reaches the merits, FDA's 

actions were lawful.  The agency relied on 

dozens of studies involving tens of thousands of 

women. Respondents don't identify any evidence 

that the agency overlooked.  They just disagree 

with the agency's analysis of the data before 

it, but that doesn't provide a license to

 agency's expert judgments.

 Finally, on remedy, the relief entered

 below would severely disrupt the federal system 

for developing and approving drugs, harming the

 agency and the pharmaceutical industry.  It

 would also inflict grave harm on women across

 the nation.  Rolling back FDA's changes would

 unnecessarily restrict access to mifepristone 

with no safety justification. 

Some women could be forced to undergo 

more invasive surgical abortions.  Others might 

not be able to access the drug at all. And all 

of this would happen at the request of 

plaintiffs who have no certain injury of their 

own. The Court should reject that profoundly 

inequitable result. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, if we agree 

with you on standing, could you give us an 

example of who would have standing to challenge 

-- to challenge these FDA actions? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: As a general 

matter, we've seen lawsuits in the past that are 

brought by, for example, prescribing physicians

or patients who want greater access to a drug.

 Sometimes we've seen theories of competitor

 standing, where a competing drug manufacturer

 might sue and claim that FDA's approval of a 

drug creates a competitive harm or in -- or

 injury in that sense.

 You know, Justice Thomas, I think that

 if the question is whether there would be

 individuals who generally oppose abortion who 

would have standing and want to challenge FDA's 

actions, the answer to that is no, but the 

reason is because those people aren't regulated 

in any relevant way under FDA's decisions here. 

You know, take these Respondent 

doctors.  They don't prescribe mifepristone. 

They don't take mifepristone, obviously.  FDA is 

not requiring them to do or refrain from doing 

anything.  They aren't required to treat women 

who take mifepristone.  FDA is not directing the 

women who take the drug to go seek out care from 

these specific doctors.  And so they stand at a 

far distance from the upstream regulatory action 

they're challenging. 

And the Court has said in -- in many 

cases that in a situation like that, when you

regulation, it can be substantially more

 difficult to establish standing.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But isn't that sort 

of a criticism of some of our associational 

standing cases and organizational standing

 cases?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think it is

 for a couple of different reasons. 

With respect to associational 

standing, this Court has said time and again 

that the association needs to identify a 

specific member who is suffering a concrete 

harm, a cognizable injury that's 

non-speculative. And I don't take Respondents 

now to take issue with that fact.  They're 

agreeing that it would be necessary to come 

forward and identify a specific doctor. 

The problem with their associational 

standing theories is that they rest on this 

chain of remote possibilities, so many different 

steps in the process that would have to occur, 

each one layering one's speculative remote odds 

of a chance of injury on top of another to get 

to the ultimate harm they're claiming on behalf

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you 

emphasized the remote nature of the injury, the

 small number of adverse effects, the likelihood

 that they'll -- the -- the patients will go to

 the emergency room and so on.

 Is there a number at which your

 argument would -- would change?  A significant

 number of consequences?  A higher likelihood of 

an emergency room visit?  Doctors who spend more 

time in the emergency room?  At -- at -- at some 

point, does this analysis lead to the other 

result? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It's hard for me to 

imagine that it could, and -- and there are a 

couple of different reasons for that.  I take 

the point that you might pick out different 

links in the chain and suggest that there are 

ways to wildly depart from the facts here and 

suggest maybe, as a statistical matter, one or 

two of those events could be probabilistically 

more likely to occur. 

But we have an objection here to the 

underlying theory as a legal matter because it 

rests on so many different things that would

turn on independent decisions made by third

 parties who are strangers to this litigation, 

who are not part of the suit.

 So we think that brings the case 

within those like Clapper or Summers, where this

 Court has recognized that when the theory of

 injury really turns on so many different 

intervening events separated by independent 

decisions, it can mean that there is just an 

insurmountable hurdle to establishing standing. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you provide a 

more specific answer to the first question that 

Justice Thomas asked you?  Is there anybody who 

could challenge in court the lawfulness of what 

the FDA did here? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  In this particular 

case, I think the answer is no. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that wasn't my 

question. Is there anybody who can do that? 

Let's -- let's start with the states 

that intervened below.  Will you say in that 

litigation, fine, you can challenge it, and 

let's get to the -- to the merits of this issue, 

the lawfulness of what the FDA did?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. We think the

 states lack standing.  They're asserting 

indirect injuries that would, if it provided a

 basis for standing, mean that states could 

always sue the federal government. And the

 Court cautioned against that result in United

 States versus Texas, Footnote 3 of that

 decision.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  How about a --

a doctor who opposes abortion? So she's on duty 

in an emergency room when a woman comes in with 

complications from having taken mifepristone, 

and the doctor is the only one there on duty who 

can attend to this woman's problem and, as a 

result, in order to save her life, the doctor 

has to abort a viable fetus. 

Now would that doctor then have 

standing to seek injunctive relief, or would you 

say that's too speculative?  This was like being 

struck by lightning and there's no -- it's not 

sufficiently likely that this is going to happen 

to this doctor again? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We would agree that 

that would represent past harm, so we're not 

disputing that that kind of conscience

 conscience, would be cognizable. But, yes, we

 think that that situation has never come to

 pass. Respondents haven't identified any 

incident in more than 20 years that mifepristone

 has been available on the market that resembles

 that kind of hypothetical situation.

 And so, yes, our view would be it's

 unduly speculative.  And you have to think about 

all of the events that would have to transpire 

to get to that moment in time. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Sure.  No, I -- I 

understand the argument. 

Now how about a woman who suffers 

adverse consequences from having taken 

mifepristone? Would she be able to sue for 

damages, or you would say that's barred by 

sovereign immunity? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I expect that we 

would have sovereign immunity arguments in that 

kind of case.  I -- I recognize that respect --

with respect to traceability, that's a harder 

argument for us.

whether what FDA did was lawful? And maybe what 

they did was perfectly lawful, but shouldn't 

somebody be able to challenge that in court?

 Who in your view?  Who would have standing to

 bring that suit?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that with 

respect to these regulatory changes, it's hard 

to identify anyone who would have standing to 

sue, but the Court has said time and again that 

the fact that no one would have standing doesn't 

provide a basis to depart from Article III 

principles. 

It said that in Raines, in Richardson, 

in Valley Forge, and in Clapper, and so I think 

it's clear that even if there is no alternative 

person here who could sue, that doesn't mean 

that the Court should dispense with the 

indispensable requirements of Article III. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  I understand 

that. And Article III is important. 

So your argument is that it doesn't 

matter if FDA flagrantly violated the law, it 

didn't do what it should have done, endangered 

the health of women, it's just too bad, nobody 

can sue in court?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Certainly, we think

 that these --

JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no -- there's

 no remedy?  The American people have no remedy

 for that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I -- I -- I 

think that it would be wrong to suggest that if 

FDA had made a mistake and a drug were actually

 producing safety consequences that there would 

be nothing to be done. I -- I don't think that 

these Respondents could invoke Article III 

jurisdiction to have the Court step in. 

But FDA takes very seriously its 

responsibility to ensure the safety of drugs. 

It conducts ongoing surveillance and can make 

adjustments to the regulatory regime if safety 

situations emerge.  The drug sponsors themselves 

remain responsible at all times. We have a tort 

system in this country, and that can help ensure 

that if there are safety problems that come to 

pass, the sponsors will take action in reaction 

to that. 

So, if the premise here is that unsafe 

drugs could somehow remain on the market, I 

think that that's incorrect.

 argument here is -- and as I said, I have great

 But your argument here is that even if

 the FDA acted unlawfully, nobody can challenge

 that in court? I mean, that's basically the 

argument you made last week, right, in the

well, these plaintiffs can't bring suit, right?

clear that FDA's regulations here don't require

 doctors to -- to -- to not grant an in-person

 visit if they think that that is the best way to

 provide a standard of care here. So they are 

not directly required to dispense mifepristone 

through any particular arrangement.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, can I ask

 you a question about the conscience injury.  So 

that's one of the roadblocks you identify in the 

speculative chain because you say a doctor could 

invoke federal conscience protections to refuse 

to complete an abortion that was when the -- the 

embryo or fetus was still alive. 

So I just want to be clear, the 

federal government's position is that their 

doctor would have conscience objections -- I'm 

thinking about the EMTALA litigation, and the 

Fifth Circuit criticized the government's 

inconsistent positions -- but it is your 

position that such doctors would have recourse 

to the conscience protections of federal law? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, absolutely.

misunderstand our arguments and Respondents have

 repeated that misunderstanding here.

 The federal government has never taken 

the position that EMTALA would override an

 individual doctor's conscience objections.  We 

said exactly the opposite. If you go and look 

at our Fifth Circuit reply brief in the Texas 

litigation, we disclaimed that understanding of

 EMTALA and made clear that we understand the 

conscience protections to continue to apply and 

shield a doctor who doesn't want to provide care 

in violation of those protections. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Would that be true 

in a healthcare desert as well? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So we don't 

think that EMTALA would override conscience 

protections for the individual doctor.  It, of 

course, imposes obligations on hospitals, and 

hospitals have all kinds of plans in place to 

address these types of contingencies.  You know, 

they have staffing plans.  I understand, as a 

matter of best practices, they often ask for 

doctors to articulate their conscience 

objections in advance so they can take account 

of that in staffing.  They have cross-staffing

 And in the government's experience

 enforcing EMTALA -- this is almost four decades

 of experience -- we are not aware of any

 situation where there has been that kind of 

direct conflict between EMTALA and conscience

 protections.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Just one last

 question.  This is about the association's 

standing, so its own standing in its own right 

I'm talking about, not its standing that based 

-- is based on injury to one of its members. 

So the injuries that the association 

is arguing sound in the Havens Realty 

associational standing, and they're the kinds of 

allegations we see by immigration advocacy 

groups, diversion of resources, increased 

expenses that result from the complications of 

having to address and explain the new changes. 

And I'm not talking about the expenses 

of filing the petition.  That's not what I'm 

talking about.  Let's just talk about the 

diversion of resources. 

Can you distinguish that from Havens 

Realty?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So I think 

Havens itself was trying to distinguish between

 two types of potential organizational injuries, 

and what Havens said is that in that case, the

 organization had come forward with direct and

 concrete demonstrable injury to itself.

 And there the organization had a 

contract to provide low-income housing or -- or 

search to secure it for clients and the racial 

steering practices directly interfered with 

that, made it more difficult for the 

organization to carry out its contractual 

obligations. 

But Havens itself said that it was not 

blessing a theory of standing that would allow 

an organization to assert a setback to its 

abstract social interests.  So I think that 

reflects the Court trying to distinguish between 

more concrete, direct demonstrable harms on the 

one hand and that kind of abstract setback on 

the other hand. 

And I recognize -- and you -- your 

question touches on it, Justice Barrett -- that 

some lower courts in particular have seemed to 

read -- read Havens to -- to endorse far broader

theories of standing, including in the

 immigration context.

 The government has been routinely

 resisting standing because we think that that 

would essentially mean that any advocacy

 organization could say it opposes what the 

federal government is doing and so, therefore, 

has to devote resources to that opposition.

 If that were enough, then every 

organization would have standing and it would be 

a vast expansion of ordinary Article III 

principles.  So we would welcome an eventual 

clarification from this Court on organizational 

standing, but, here, I think that the 

organization's assertion of injury falls in the 

bucket of the abstract setback and doesn't come 

close to the kind of demonstrable harm that was 

at issue in Havens.

I'm sorry.

think that the three changes made in 2016 would 

be more dangerous in combination than they were 

individually.  But isn't that -- isn't that 

obvious, that three things that may be innocuous 

or not excessively dangerous, if engaged in by 

themselves, may become very dangerous when 

they're all done together?  And why shouldn't 

the FDA have addressed that?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think the only 

way that that would be true would be if the

 three changes are interconnected and mutually

 reinforcing, guarding against the same kind of

 safety risk.  So I agree that if there were a

 reason to think that the -- the reason why 

mifepristone is safe up to 10 weeks' gestation

 is because it's being prescribed by doctors 

instead of nurse practitioners, for example, 

then those changes would be interconnected 

because one change would effectively be the 

safety net for another. 

But there was nothing like that in 

this record.  The studies that FDA examined 

instead demonstrated that these changes -- and 

-- and it was an exhaustive examination -- were 

safe not because there were other different 

safeguards in place to guard against risks but, 

rather, because, if you go up to 10 weeks of 

gestation, there is no observable increase in 

serious adverse events, no matter who's 

prescribing. 

So, in the absence of that kind of 

correlative effect of the changes, I don't think 

you can fault the agency for not giving even

more explicit attention to this issue.  And it

 did. It cited multiple studies that combined 

multiple changes precisely because the standard 

of care had evolved over the 15 years

 mifepristone had been approved, and many of the 

changes were already being deployed together

 safely.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Shouldn't the FDA have 

at least considered the application of 18 U.S.C. 

1461? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I think 

that the Comstock provisions don't fall within 

FDA's lane.  FDA, under the FDCA, can only 

maintain restrictions under the REMS program if 

it's necessary to ensure safe use.  In 2021, 

what FDA determined is you don't need in-person 

dispensing for safe use, so the FDCA did not 

independently require that REMS restriction, 

and, in fact, it couldn't be imposed once FDA 

had made that determination. 

Now that doesn't affect other sources 

of law.  FDA was not affirmatively approving 

mailing in violation of Comstock, even if you 

interpreted it that way.  And we don't think it 

means what Respondents suggest it means.  But,

at the very least, I don't think that it was

 FDA's responsibility to consider that, nor could 

it have permissibly considered that under the

 statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it didn't say 

any of that. It didn't say anything about it.

 And this is a prominent provision.  It's not

 some obscure subsection of a complicated obscure

 law. They -- they knew about it.  Everybody in 

this field knew about it. 

Shouldn't they have at least addressed 

it? You have answers to the arguments that are 

made on the other side.  Shouldn't the FDA have 

at least said we've considered those and provide 

some kind of an explanation? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Let me give two 

responses.  One is that I don't think it would 

have even been permissible for FDA to consider 

maintaining this restriction because of 

Comstock.  If you look at the relevant statutory 

section here -- it's 355-1(g)(4).  This is 

reproduced at page 6a of the appendix to our 

brief. It's very clear that the only thing FDA 

can take into account for restrictions are 

safety and efficacy concerns in deciding whether

to maintain a REMS program.

 But the other thing I would say, 

Justice Alito, is that the agency did have a

 memorandum on Comstock.  It's at JA 535.  That 

was the advice that FDA received from OLC

 conveying the interpretation of Comstock.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It -- they got the 

advice from OLC, but it didn't refer to that,

 did it? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  In the 2021 

decision, no.  But the REMS was then modified in 

2023, and this was part of the administrative 

record for that. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  One -- one last 

question.  The plaintiffs say that the studies 

that the FDA relied on for the 2021 amendments 

say that mail-order mifepristone suggests more 

frequent trips to the emergency room. 

Now this is what I see as the FDA's 

response to that.  "Although the literature 

suggests there may be more frequent emergency 

room care visits related to the use of 

mifepristone when dispensed by mail from the 

clinic, there are no apparent increases in other 

serious adverse events related to mifepristone

use."

 Does that really count as a reasoned

 explanation to the suggestion that the data

 shows there are going to be more emergency room

 visits?  This is -- the -- the increase in

 emergency room visits is just of no consequence?

 It doesn't even merit some -- some comment?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That is a reasoned 

explanation. What FDA was observing in that 

passage is that although it acknowledged the 

fact that some of the studies reported 

additional emergency room visits, that didn't 

equate to additional serious adverse events. 

And, in fact, one of the studies, half 

of the women who went to the emergency room 

didn't get any treatment at all. Many women 

might go because they're experiencing heavy 

bleeding, which mimics a miscarriage, and they 

might just need to know whether or not they're 

having a complication.  But, in that kind of 

circumstance, the woman is not having a -- a --

a serious adverse event from mifepristone, and 

so it doesn't call into question the safety 

determinations regarding the drug. 

And, you know, at the end of the day,

gleaned with respect to safety and efficacy. It

 fully explained its decision-making, and I think

FDA, correct?

it overlooked this aspect of the studies. 

I also want to emphasize, Justice 

Sotomayor, that the studies were far from the

having with Justice Barrett about the conscience 

objection and just ask you -- I'm sure that 

you've read the declarations carefully, and I'm 

sure Ms. Hawley will have things to say about

what is the conscience objection?  What -- what 

are the doctors objecting to exactly?

declarations are specific on this point.  There 

are only seven doctors who regularly practice 

and submitted evidence, and the declarations are 

relatively short.  This is at JA 150 to 200.  I 

encourage reading them because there are only 

two doctors out of the seven who even provide 

any information about their specific conscience 

objections. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Those two are who?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Those are Dr. Skop 

and Dr. Francis. The relevant language for Dr.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The other five don't

 refer to conscience objections?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  They don't refer to

 their own conscience objections or provide any

 specific detail about exactly what care would

 violate their conscience.  Dr. Francis is at JA 

155. Dr. Skop is at JA 167.  Both describe the 

injury in the same terms.  They object to ending 

the life of a human being in the womb and fear 

that they might have to complete an abortion for 

a woman who has an ongoing pregnancy. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, as you understand 

those declarations, they do not object to 

providing whatever care is necessary to a person 

who may have complications from taking 

mifepristone?  In other words, for example, 

suppose somebody has bled significantly, needs a 

transfusion, or, you know, any of a number of 

other things that might happen.  As you 

understand the declarations, there's not an 

objection to that?

fairest reading of the declarations is they are

 not objecting to that. Now I acknowledge that

 Respondents, in their red brief, have suggested 

there's a broader conscience injury in play here 

and that there might be other doctors who have a

 broader concern about providing any care.

 Even if that broader conscience injury

 had been in this declaration, we think still, as 

a matter of law, they could not demonstrate that 

they have a non-speculative injury, in part 

because of all of the upstream things that would 

have to happen in terms of a woman having the 

serious event, going to these specific doctors, 

but also the fact the federal conscience 

protections are specifically designed to deal 

with this issue, and they would cover the range 

of conscience objections that exist in this 

context. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right, there are 

obviously conscience objections of all kinds.  I 

was just asking --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- about the 

particular declarations of these particular 

members of the organizations.

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think, 

on these declarations, they have not asserted a

 broader injury.  But, even if they could 

conceivably come forward with other doctors or 

try to adjust their declarations in some way,

 still that would not suffice.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Can I just ask 

a quick question about the merits? You -- you

 open your brief with a -- a somewhat arresting 

statement, but it starts with, "To the 

government's knowledge," and this was written a 

few months ago, and since then, I'm sure that 

you've had lots of time to think about this case 

and to get all background information on it. 

So I'll just read you this sentence 

and ask you whether it's still true to the 

government's knowledge.  "To the government's 

knowledge, this case marks the first time" --

and I'm going to say is it -- is it the first 

time, is it the only time -- "any court has 

restricted access to an FDA-approved drug by 

second-guessing FDA's expert judgment about the 

conditions required to assure that drug's safe 

use." Is it still the only time?

 that. We have seen a disturbing trend of courts

 sometimes also overriding FDA's judgment to try 

to grant greater access to drugs when that

 overrides FDA's expert judgment about what's

 necessary to ensure safe use.

 And no matter which direction you come 

at it from, we, on behalf of FDA, think that 

courts have no business making those judgments 

in the absence of the kind of arbitrary and 

capricious error that would satisfy the APA.

brief.

 The Church Amendments have the most 

comprehensive protection here, and we think that 

those amendments guard against the kind of

 injury that Respondents are asserting.  There 

are also state law protections that often apply

 in this context.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Would that be true 

even if the declarations were interpreted as 

Respondents do to say that they regard any 

participation, even transfusions or D&Cs after 

the abortion is otherwise complete because 

tissue needs to be removed? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, I think that 

would be true.  So the most relevant Church 

Amendment provision is 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(d), and 

its language says that a doctor shall not be 

required to perform or -- or assist in any part 

of the healthcare program that would violate the 

doctor's religious or moral beliefs.  So it's 

tied to the nature of the doctor's beliefs 

rather than particular procedures.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And one other

 question, and this goes to the merits.

 As I understand it, the serious 

adverse consequences that have to be reported or 

that FDA considers risks are death and

 transfusion but not, say -- I mean, it -- it 

seems to me, and I think the data bears this

 out, that the elimination of the in-person 

dispensing requirement or, you know, the 

in-person visit at the outset would lead to 

mistakes in gestational aging, which could 

increase D& -- the need for a D&C or the amount 

of bleeding, et cetera. 

But that does not count, correct, as 

an adverse event? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I want to 

be careful because there's a list of serious 

adverse events and I'm not sure that I have all 

of them down to be able to recite them to you, 

although they're in the record, but I -- I do 

think the premise of the question is wrong. 

This idea that the change to in-person 

dispensing would necessarily increase the risk 

of those events, that was not reflected in the 

data that FDA consulted, and I would point you

to JA 383 to 384 in particular --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- where FDA -- FDA

 explained that even in person you're not

 necessarily getting an ultrasound.  That's never 

been required. And so the relevant question

 might be is your -- your provider going to ask

 you a series of screening questions, like when 

was your last menstrual period, in person or via 

telemedicine, and there's no evident reason why 

that difference would actually lead to different 

safety outcomes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So there was not 

even a -- I thought that there was a small 

percentage increase in the tracking.  I'm wrong 

about that?  Which I may well be. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So --

JUSTICE BARRETT: You know the JA way 

better than I do, General. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah.  So I -- I --

I think that with respect to the ER visits, 

there was some evidence that there were 

increased ER visits, although, as I explained to 

Justice Alito, that wasn't actually correlated 

with an increase in serious adverse events.

You know, I -- I don't want to

 represent all of the different --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- findings of the

 different studies because they varied a little 

bit, but FDA's ultimate conclusion was that

 mifepristone could safely be dispensed without

 in-person visits.  It had voluminous evidence, I

 think, to support that conclusion in 2021.  And 

there's been no contrary evidence that's been 

introduced. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So there was no 

requirement of either an ultrasound or detecting 

a fetal heartbeat or anything like that even 

before the doctor could just go based on the 

woman's recounting when her last menstrual 

period was? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  And 

that dates all the way back to the initial 

approval of this drug in 2000.  It has never 

been a required condition of use to have an 

ultrasound.  FDA has always left that up to 

medical judgment.

remains true under the REMS now. Prescribers 

still have to have that capability, and they 

have to deploy whatever mechanisms they believe 

would accurately allow them to identify

 contraindications for use of mifepristone.

 But it's wrong to suggest that if the 

Court reverses 2021 changes, then every woman's

 going to get an ultrasound.  That's never been 

the -- the state of play in how this drug has 

been administered. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  How, even under the 

pre-2021 REMS, was it possible to detect an 

ectopic pregnancy without an ultrasound unless 

the woman was presenting with pain? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So there's a set of 

screening questions that are often deployed. 

You can ask things like, do you have unilateral 

pelvic pain?  Did you become pregnant while you 

had an IUD in or after a tubal ligation?  Are 

you experiencing unusual bleeding?  You could 

ask whether the woman has had a prior ectopic 

pregnancy. 

And if the woman has those kinds of 

risk factors, then imaging may be necessary, but

The prescriber has to be confident that it has 

excluded those kinds of conditions before

 prescribing this drug.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Jackson? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Good morning, 

General. 

So I'm worried that there is a 

significant mismatch in this case between the 

claimed injury and the remedy that's being 

sought and that that might or should matter for 

standing purposes.  I don't know that our 

doctrines sort of capture this, but I -- I guess 

I see it that the injuries that the Respondents 

allege, as you've articulated them, are a 

conscience injury, that they are being forced to 

participate in a medical procedure that they 

object to. 

And so the obvious common-sense remedy 

would be to provide them with an exemption, that

they don't have to participate in this

 procedure.  And you say, and you've said here 

several times, that federal law already gives

 them that.

 So I guess then what they're asking 

for in this lawsuit is -- is more than that. 

They're saying, because we object to having to

 be forced to participate in this procedure,

 we're seeking an order preventing anyone from 

having access to these drugs at all. 

And I -- I guess I'm just trying to 

understand how they could possibly be entitled 

to that given the injury that they have alleged. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I agree, Justice 

Jackson, and -- and I do think it's relevant to 

standing.  There's a profound mismatch here 

between the claimed injury and the remedy they 

were seeking. 

And, you know, you can almost think of 

this as a -- a type of zone of interest kind of 

analysis.  You know, if the doctors have a 

conscience injury, there's a specific statute 

designed to deal with it, to specifically 

tailor-made guard against the risk of that 

injury occurring.

kind the lower courts issued, and that runs 

counter to ordinary Article III principles of

 party-specific relief.

 But I just think it shows that there's 

something wrong with the theory of injury in the

 first place because it's so attenuated and 

because they claim they would need so much

 relief all over the country. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let me ask you 

another question.  In addition to the challenges 

that we have here, the Respondents below 

challenged the FDA's initial decision to approve 

mifepristone in -- in the year 2000. 

Of course, that occurred a very long 

time ago.  The Fifth Circuit found that that 

challenge wasn't timely because of the statute 

of limitations.  As -- as you're aware, in the 

context of another case we heard this term, the 

Court is currently considering the statute of 

limitations issue. 

So setting aside standing, have you 

thought about how a ruling from this Court on 

the statute of limitations in either direction 

might impact what happens in these kinds of 

cases with these kinds of challenges?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I -- I -- I

 think that it just reflects the stakes of the 

Corner Post case and provides a vivid example of 

the way that it might be possible, if this Court 

were to approve the request for a broader theory 

of the statute of limitations in that case, the 

way it could open the door to plaintiffs coming 

in and saying, well, I only became a doctor

 later, or I only started working in an emergency 

room later and would try to unsettle 

longstanding agency actions that maybe occurred 

decades previously. 

I do want to say that I understand the 

Corner Post petitioner to have suggested maybe 

there would be equitable defenses that the 

government could raise in those kinds of cases. 

We would certainly want to raise that type of 

defense with respect to the approval of 

mifepristone, which I think has generated 

tremendous reliance interests and proven to be 

safe and effective over decades of use.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSICA L. ELLSWORTH

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

DANCO LABORATORIES, L.L.C.

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 In 2016 and 2021, FDA made certain 

changes to the labeling and use restrictions for

 Danco's drug, Mifeprex.  The decision below 

stops Danco from selling Mifeprex in line with 

that scientific judgment based on a highly 

attenuated claim that an unknown doctor could be 

called someday to an unknown emergency room 

after a series of decisions by third parties. 

No facts causally link that possible future 

encounter to a specific change FDA made in 2016 

or 2021. 

Respondents' view of the Food, Drug, 

and Cosmetic Act is so inflexible it would upend 

not just Mifeprex but virtually every drug 

approval and REMS modification FDA has made for 

decades. 

Reversal is required for two reasons: 

First, Article III standing is not an 

academic exercise in what's conceivable. 

Respondents lack standing under every prong of

the analysis.

 Second, on the merits, FDA

 exhaustively considered the evidence and 

reasonably explained its conclusions, which is 

what is required to do.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  The government, the

 Solicitor General points out, would not be

 susceptible to a Comstock Act problem.  But your 

-- in your case, you would be. 

So how do you respond to an argument 

that mailing your product and advertising it 

would violate the Comstock Act? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Justice Thomas, we 

agree very much with the government that FDA's 

charge under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is 

limited to looking at safety and efficacy 

considerations.  That's true for new drug 

approvals.  It's also true for REMS 

modifications.  FDA routinely approves drugs 

whose manufacture and distribution is restricted 

by other laws, like the Controlled Substances 

Act, environmental laws, customs laws, and so

 about the mischief it would invite if it allowed 

agencies to start taking action based on

 statutory responsibilities that Congress has 

assigned to other agencies. 

On the merits, this issue was not

 presented below -- excuse me -- was not ruled on 

below, and in any event, I would also point out 

that in 2021, FDA's decision allows use of

 brick-and-mortar pharmacies, in addition to 

mail-order pharmacies. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, my problem is 

that you're private.  The government -- I 

understand the government's argument.  But 

you're private, and the statute doesn't have the 

sort of safe harbor that you're suggesting, and 

it's fairly broad, and it specifically covers 

drugs such as yours. 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Your Honor, we 

disagree that that's the correct interpretation 

of the statute, but we think that in order to 

address the correct interpretation, there would 

need to be a situation in which that issue was 

actually teed up. 

This statute has not been enforced for 

nearly a hundred years, and I -- I don't believe

that this case presents an opportunity for this 

Court to opine on the reach of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'd 

like to ask you the same questions I was posing 

to the Solicitor General. You know, our

 precedents, Clapper and Susan B. Anthony List, 

talk about requiring a substantial risk that 

harm will recur, and you argue that's not

 present here. 

How are we supposed to find the spot 

at which the risk becomes substantial? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Your Honor, I -- I 

think this Court has always thought about these 

standing inquiries as really a question of 

degree, and you're trying to evaluate whether 

something is actual and imminent or whether it's 

conjectural and hypothetical.  And these terms, 

"substantial risk," "certainly impending," which 

has been used dating all the way back to 1923, 

get at where a claim falls in this spectrum. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I 

mean, we toss around a lot of adjectives, but 

I'm just trying -- as a practical matter, how do 

you figure out -- I mean, what percentage of 

adverse consequences would be enough?  What

percentage of emergency room visits would be

 enough?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  I think the way 

Clapper got at that question -- and -- and you 

can see this in Footnote 5 of the opinion -- is

 to really think about whether there is an 

attenuated chain of contingencies that have to

 happen.

 And in situations where there is this 

kind of attenuated chain of circumstances 

involving third-party decisions that have to 

play out in a particular way -- and, here, that 

chain is quite long -- that that squarely puts a 

plaintiffs' theory on the side of the 

conjectural or hypothetical and not the 

certainly impending injury. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  How is your company 

aggrieved by the challenge that is brought in 

this case?  I -- I gather this is -- your 

version of mifepristone is the only product you 

are currently marketing, is that right?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  That is correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  And so I 

gather your injury is that you think you're

 going to sell more if the restrictions that

 previously were in place were lifted?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So you're going to

 make more money? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  The -- the injury is 

that we are prevented from selling our product 

in line with FDA's scientific judgment about the 

safe and efficacious use of the drug. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you're going to be 

harmed because you're going to sell more? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  I think that certainly 

a company's ability to market its product is a 

part of how it considers the regulatory scheme 

that governs its conduct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  During the questioning 

of the Solicitor General, the statement was made 

that no court has ever previously second-guessed 

the FDA's judgment about access to a -- to a

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think the FDA

 is infallible?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  No, Your Honor, we

 don't think that at all.  And we don't think 

that question is really teed up in -- in any way

 in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Has the FDA ever 

approved a drug and then pulled it after 

experience showed that it had a lot of really 

serious adverse consequences? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  It -- it has certainly 

done that.  And, Your Honor, I think that 

underscores why the adverse event reporting, the 

post-market surveillance that FDA does, the 

ability that these plaintiffs have, even if they 

don't have standing, certainly, if there are --

if they are seeing patients who are presenting 

with adverse events, if they are doing studies 

that show there is some unknown safety component 

that FDA should acknowledge, they can take 

significant steps to bring that to the agency's 

attention, to bring that to Danco's attention.

 reporting of non-fatal consequences?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  Your Honor, the FDA 

decided not to continue that reporting 

requirement in 2016 based on more than 15 years

 of a well-established safety profile when that

 reporting was required.  There is no drug on the 

market today under any REMS that requires the 

kind of reporting that the plaintiffs are saying

 should be reimposed here. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So why would that be a 

bad thing?  Wouldn't your company -- you don't 

want to sell a product that -- that causes very 

serious harm to the people who take your 

product, relying on your tests and the FDA's 

tests. Wouldn't you want that -- that data? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Your Honor, that --

that data is certainly something that we are 

looking for all the time.  It is part of the 

reporting obligations for a manufacturer to be 

aware of any data that's becoming available 

through any means.  We have a 1-800 number on 

our website.  There is a 1-800 number on the 

labeling.

gets at concern I heard in some of the earlier

 questioning about who would have standing if

 these plaintiffs don't have standing.  And one 

of the things I want to note is that drug 

manufacturers are very frequently subject to 

tort litigation, product liability suits,

 failure to warn suits, deceptive advertising 

suits, when someone is claiming harm from a

 pharmaceutical manufacturer's product.

 What is so, I think, revolutionary 

really about the -- the arguments here, both on 

standing and the merits, are the way that they 

attempt by individuals who do not use this 

product, do not prescribe this product, and have 

a conscience right not to treat anyone who has 

taken this product, those individuals want to 

prevent anyone else from using it in line with 

FDA's considered scientific judgment.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you go --

along the same lines.  Does your company think 

that what the FDA has done preempts state laws 

that prohibit the dispensation of mifepristone 

within their borders?

what is your company's position on it? You

 haven't even thought about it? One of your

 competitors made that argument, right?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  That's right.  There 

are some lawsuits that have been brought by the 

generic company that do make that argument.  And 

I think that is for later courts to -- to sort 

out.

-- could you talk about that a little bit? What 

are the normal standards for adverse event

 reporting as you understand them?  Why are they

 there? What instead were you subject to in the

 past?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  May I answer the

 question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  Justice Kagan, what 

changed was not Danco's adverse event reporting 

responsibility.  Danco's adverse event reporting 

responsibility has been the same throughout this 

period. 

What changed was that from 2000 until 

2016, prescribers were obligated to report 

adverse events to Danco and then Danco then had 

its separate reporting obligation to FDA. 

So what -- in -- in 2016, the REMS for 

mifepristone were aligned to be more consistent 

with the reporting requirement that applies to 

all 20,000-plus FDA-approved drugs.  There are 

only today seven REMS that continue to have even 

the limited higher adverse event reporting for 

deaths that apply to -- to mifepristone.  So it 

is only one of seven that have that.

 bit about what they say?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  I -- I'm -- I'm happy

 I think the -- the reality is -- and

example of it. You have a district court that 

among other things relied on one study that was 

an analysis of anonymous blog posts. 

You have a -- another set of studies 

that he relied on that were not in the 

administrative record and would never be because 

they post-date the FDA decisions here.  They 

have since been retracted for lack of scientific 

rigor and for misleading presentations of data. 

Those sorts of errors can infect 

judicial analyses precisely because judges are 

not -- they are not experts in statistics. They 

are not experts in -- in the methodology used 

for scientific studies, for clinical trials. 

That is why FDA has many hundreds of 

pages of analysis in the record of what the 

scientific data showed, and courts are just not

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIN M. HAWLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. HAWLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

FDA approved abortion by mail based on 

data it admitted was "not adequate."  That 

violates the APA.  The lower court's decision 

merely restored longstanding and crucial 

protections under which millions of women used 

abortion drugs. 

We've heard a lot this morning about 

standing.  Article III is satisfied here 

because, one, the FDA relies on OB hospitalists 

to care for women harmed by abortion drugs. 

Two, the FDA concedes that between 2.9 and 

4.6 percent of women will end up in the 

emergency room.  And, three, the FDA 

acknowledges that women are even more likely to

 care without an in-person visit.

 According to Guttmacher, nearly 

650,000 women take mifepristone every single 

year. It's no surprise that Respondents have 

experienced an increase in emergency room visits 

and, indeed, treated women suffering from 

abortion drug harms tens of thousands of times 

-- excuse me, dozens of times, women have 

suffered tens of thousands of times. 

That Respondent doctors will be forced 

to manage abortion drug harm is not a bug in 

FDA's system but part of its very design. 

Ruling against Respondents on standing here 

would allow federal agencies to conscript 

non-regulated parties into violating their 

consciences and suffering other harm without 

judicial recourse.  Article III neither demands 

nor permits this. 

FDA's outsourcing of abortion drug 

harm to Respondent doctors forces them to choose 

between helping a woman with a life-threatening 

condition and violating their conscience.  This 

Hobson's Choice is intolerable. 

On the merits, FDA failed to comply

with basic APA requirements.  In 2021, it 

eliminated the initial in-person visit based on

 data it says elsewhere is unreliable.  And in

 2016, it failed to consider or explain the

 cumulative effects of its wholesale removal of

 safeguards.  These actions fall far short of

 what the APA requires.  This Court should

 affirm.

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, you assert

Alliance of diverted time and resources. 

Isn't that just the cost of 

litigating, of -- of pursuing this litigation? 

MS. HAWLEY: I -- I don't think so, 

Your Honor, for a couple of reasons. 

First, what Respondent doctors have 

done here is chosen their particular practice, 

as well as structured that medical practice to 

bring life into the world. 

When they are called from their labor 

and delivery floor down to the operating room to 

treat a woman suffering from abortion drug harm, 

that is diametrically opposed to why they 

entered the medical profession.

MS. HAWLEY: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

So we think Havens Realty is on all fours with 

this case.  The best evidence of that, I 

believe, is the FDA's reply brief.  The 

government resorts to the underlying briefs in 

the case to say that there was a contract and an 

economic harm, but this Court's case 

specifically said that the fact that the harm --

the nature of the harm was "non-economic" did 

not prevent the Court from finding an injury. 

In Havens, the Court looked to two 

things, whether there -- whether there was an 

impairment of the organization's mission and, 

second, whether there was an expenditure of

 resources.  Both things are satisfied here.

 If you look at how our organizations 

have been harmed, they've been forced to divert

 resources from speaking and advocating for their

 pro-life mission generally to explaining the 

dangers of the harm from abortion drugs.

 One of the primary reasons that that's 

required is because, in 2016, FDA took away the

 requirement that abortion providers report 

adverse events --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well --

MS. HAWLEY: -- aside from deaths. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- but that would be 

anyone who is aggressive or vigilant about 

bringing lawsuits.  Just simply by using 

resources to advocate their position in court 

you say now causes an injury.  That seems easily 

-- easy to manufacture. 

MS. HAWLEY: So I don't think that's 

true in this case, Justice Thomas.  I 

acknowledge that the lower courts have cabined 

Havens to say where you have sort of prelude to 

litigation types of activities, in those sorts

In this case, if you look at 

Respondents' declarations, they note that they

 have performed studies.  They've analyzed 

studies. Several of those are in the record and 

-- and they're not short.

 They came -- comb through Medicaid

 data, they comb through FAERS data, so they get

 at the true nature of adverse events.  And all

 those sorts of things are neither a prelude to 

litigation, nor would they have occurred but for 

FDA's unlawful conduct in this case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, in the 

line you quoted about economic harm, that had to 

do with the fact that they didn't intend through 

their testers to rent an apartment, and so there 

was no economic loss to them or gain to them 

from renting the apartment. 

But what was, I think, the SG is 

pointing to is that they provided services on 

their own. It wasn't just the member services 

that they were relying upon.  They were 

providing services to people to help them rent 

apartments. 

And so that's a very important 

distinction from here. Separate from the

 individual defendants' claims of -- of standing

 based on wasted resources, their resources, the

 organizations are not losing anything.

 MS. HAWLEY: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Their job is to do 

exactly what you're talking about and they're

 doing it. They're investigating certain

 problems, but that's not an injury that's

 redressable by this -- by vacating this rule. 

MS. HAWLEY: So a couple of things, 

Your Honor.  This Court's opinion in Havens did 

not rely on the economic nature at all. Again, 

I'd point Your Honor to the line in Havens where 

the Court says the non-economic nature of 

respondents' interest in housing.  They were 

speaking broadly. Again, you have to dig to the 

underlying briefs to find the economic interest 

that this Court did not rely on. 

With respect to our own injury, it's 

absolutely redressable.  For example, if the 

regulations are put back in place, the 

protections whereby individual abortion 

providers need to provide information about 

adverse events, that would provide our 

Respondent organizations with more accurate

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- can I ask you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- about the remedy 

and sort of the way that I was talking with the

 SG. I mean, it makes perfect sense for the 

individual doctors to seek an exemption, but as 

I understand it, they already have that, and so 

what they're asking for here is that in order to 

prevent them from possibly ever having to do 

these kinds of procedures, everyone else should 

be prevented from getting access to this 

medication. 

So why isn't that plainly overbroad 

scope of the remedy the end of this case? 

MS. HAWLEY: So, with respect to the 

premise of that question, Justice Jackson, I 

don't think our doctors necessarily are -- are 

able to object for two reasons. 

One of this -- this is the emergency 

nature of these procedures.  As the FDA 

acknowledges, many women do go to the emergency 

room, and if we just think about what that might

situations.  Respondent doctors don't 

necessarily know until they scrub into that 

operating room whether this may or may not be 

abortion drug harm.  It could be a miscarriage, 

it could be an ectopic pregnancy, or it could be 

an elective abortion, Your Honor.

and while we would love for this Court to adopt 

that position, they told the district court the

 very opposite.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me 

ask you this. If we were to find that there are

 conscientious objections that, say, hospitals 

take them into account and these doctors do have

 a way to not do these kinds of procedures, 

should we end this case on that basis? 

MS. HAWLEY: No, Your Honor.  We would 

welcome that holding, but it's not broad enough 

to remedy our doctors' harm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why? 

MS. HAWLEY: Because these are 

emergency situations, they -- they can't waste 

precious moments scrubbing in, scrubbing out --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, no. I'm 

saying -- I'm saying, assuming we have a world 

in which they can actually lodge the objections 

that you say that they have, my question is, 

isn't that enough to remedy their issue?  Do we 

have to also entertain your argument that no one 

else in the world can have this drug or no one 

else in America should have this drug in order 

to protect your clients?

 I -- I -- I think Justice Jackson's 

saying let's spot you all that, okay, with

 respect to your -- your clients.  Normally, in

 Article III traditional equitable remedies, we 

issue and we say over and over again, provide a 

remedy sufficient to address the plaintiff's 

asserted injuries and go no further. 

We have before us a handful of 

individuals who have asserted a conscience 

objection.  Normally, we would allow equitable 

relief to address them.  Recently, I think what 

Justice Jackson's alluding to, we've had one 

might call it a rash of universal injunctions or 

vacaturs.  And this case seems like a prime 

example of turning what could be a small lawsuit 

into a nationwide legislative assembly on -- on 

-- on an FDA rule or any other federal 

government action.  Thoughts?

-- to raise a -- a conscience objection.  But --

but, even spotting that, I think the -- the 

district court remedy here was perfectly

 appropriate under Section 705.

 Section 705 grants the reviewing 

courts the authority to issue all necessary and

 appropriate relief.  And as the government

 acknowledged in oral argument in Corner Post, 

when the parties before the court are 

non-regulated parties, the only avenue in which 

they can possibly get relief -- and, of course, 

that's sort of the sine qua non of equitable 

relief, is that the parties before the court get 

it, and that's for, as in this case, a stay to 

issue or -- or another case is a vacatur, and 

that's because, without that sort of relief, the 

very parties before the court won't get it. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think --

Agency, you can't do this anywhere?

 MS. HAWLEY: So -- so I think, Your 

Honor, that might be impracticable. If we're 

thinking again about the emergency room 

situation, would Dr. Francis, again, have to

 know when she's in the emergency room whether 

this is a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy, or 

an elective abortion? This is what she does day 

in and day out. 

And so it seems like to say that --

that these would run to particular plaintiffs 

would be missing that the FDA regulations would 

still be in place and permit things like 

mail-order abortions.  They would have removed 

the reporting requirements. 

And if we look at the merits of what 

FDA did in 2021, FDA relied on two things. They 

relied first on the FAERS data. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel -- counsel, 

before you pivot back to the merits, and I can 

understand your impulse there, but -- but I went 

back and looked, and there are exactly zero 

universal injunctions that were issued during

And over the last four years or so, 

the number is something like 60 and -- maybe

 more than that, and they're -- they're a 

relatively new thing. And you're asking us to

 extend and -- and pursue this relatively new

 remedial course which this Court has never

 adopted itself.  Lower courts have kind of run

 with this.  And I -- I just want to give you one

 more shot at that. 

MS. HAWLEY: Sure, Your Honor.  So, 

again, the APA, of course, encapsulates 

equitable remedies.  And as Pomeroy and others 

have said from the beginning of the 19th 

Century, equity requires that the parties before 

the court get relief. 

In this instance, again, as the 

government pointed out in Corner Post, where you 

have non-regulated parties, those -- those 

parties could be farmers, they could be 

ranchers, they could be the seed farms in 

Geertson, but their only availability for relief 

is if the court does something to the FDA order 

or regulation at issue.  Otherwise, those 

parties are simply out of luck, and that's 

inconsistent with equity.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  May I ask, Ms. Hawley,

 about your basic theory of standing?  And just 

-- this is a clarification question as much as

 it's anything.

 When you did your 1, 2, 3 in your

 opening statement, it sounded very probabilistic

 to me. I mean, I don't remember exactly what

 the 1, 2, 3 are, but, you know, let's say it's

 something along the lines of we represent a lot 

of doctors, and there are a lot of women out 

there taking mifepristone, and some fraction of 

them are going to have adverse events, and some 

fraction of those are going to come to the 

emergency room, and -- and so there's some 

probability or likelihood that one of our 

doctors who has a conscience objection is going 

to come face-to-face with one of these women who 

has an adverse event. 

Is that your theory? 

MS. HAWLEY: No, Your Honor.  What we 

think really shows that Respondents have 

standing here is FDA's own acknowledgments.  I 

would point you to JA 384. And in regulating 

mifepristone, FDA has continually said that 

emergency room doctors and OB-GYN hospitalists

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think then it 

is your theory. I mean, you're just saying even

 FDA admits that there are going to be some

 adverse events, people are going to show up in 

emergency rooms, people are going to come

 face-to-face with one of our doctors who objects 

to some aspect of the treatment. That's the

 theory, yes? 

MS. HAWLEY: Well, we certainly think 

all of that is true, but we don't think it's a 

problem with probabilistic standing, as was the 

case under Summers, for three reasons. 

First, Summers involved unidentified 

members.  Here, we have seven named plaintiffs. 

In addition, no one in Summers at least that was 

still part of the case had --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So does your 

theory really depend on your having at least one 

person?  Because I take Summers to be saying 

these probability theories, they sound very 

nice; they have nothing to do with our Article 

III requirements.  You need a person.  You need 

a person to be able to come in and meet the 

courts' regular standing requirements.

Dr. Francis, at the beginning, there's been some

the conscience harm.  But, if you look at JA

That echoes the CMDA declaration at 142 and 143.

 It's also consistent with --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Has she ever been --

 because I -- I -- I -- I read that declaration

 pretty carefully.  Has -- what actual emergency

 treatment has she participated in that she 

objects to and that -- and that she has stated

 an objection to?

 MS. HAWLEY: So the prior page, Your 

Honor, JA 154, talks about a D&C which she was 

required to perform due to a life-threatening 

emergency. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  She herself performed 

that?

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And did she have an 

opportunity to object?  Did she object? 

MS. HAWLEY: No, Your Honor.  Again,

objections, the way people with conscience 

objections do this is they make those objections

 known. And, you know, that may be harder.  It

 may be easier in a particular context, but most

 hospitals have mechanisms in place, routines in

 place to ensure that doctors who are allowed to 

do this, you know, in advance, right, and are 

allowed to do it at the moment, they say so. 

And I -- I -- when I looked at 

Dr. Francis's and Dr. Skop's, there's just 

nothing that you have there that suggests --

federal conscience protections intended them to

 apply in emergency situations.

 So it's a lot to ask our Respondent 

doctors to go up to the top floor and litigate

 this with the general counsel when the federal 

government's telling them they don't have a

 conscience protection.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Counsel --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it true that our 

standing decisions have not relied on 

probabilistic determinations like the Department 

of Commerce case?  The Court said there was 

standing because, if a question about 

citizenship was included on the -- on the -- the 

questionnaire, a certain percentage, an unknown 

percentage of residents would then not fill out 

the census at all and, therefore, it was 

probable that there was some risk that New York 

State would risk losing a representative in the 

House of Representatives or would risk losing 

money under some federal program, and you put 

together this chain of probabilities and that 

was sufficient to establish standing.

with that, Justice Alito.

 In particular, you can look at the

 Geertson Seed Farms case, which also involved

 non-regulated parties, and this Court looked at 

the distance that bees might fly in order to

 pollinate seed farms.

 So it's certainly true that data is

 appropriate to consider in determining whether

 there's a substantial risk under SBA List. 

Here, the FDA admits -- this is at 533 -- that 

between 2.9 and 4.6 percent of women will go to 

the emergency room.  It acknowledges -- this is 

at 542 -- that up to 7 percent of women will 

need surgical intervention. 

And when the FDA talks about there 

being no increase in adverse events from the 

increased gestational age, the only way they can 

say that is by ignoring surgical interventions, 

and that's because, at JA 207, the FDA --

people are illegally breaking the law and

 supplying it contrary to law, but what does that

 do to your probability, which is -- it's already

 infinitesimally small because there are

 thousands of hospitals in the country, 50

 states, I don't know how many territories,

 thousands and thousands of -- of -- of places 

where pregnant women go who may be suffering 

from miscarriages or otherwise, to know or to 

even imagine how one doctor is going to ever 

actually see a patient that it's going to be --

that he or she is going to be forced to 

intervene on their behalf, but then add to it 

that this is illegal in these states. 

MS. HAWLEY: So I think the -- the 

best answer, Justice Sotomayor, is that past is 

prologue.  In our declarations, we have three 

doctors who have treated harms from abortion 

drugs at least a dozen times. 

We have two examples when women went 

out of state.  And if you go out of state, 

there's a higher likelihood you're not going to 

have a follow-up visit.  What FDA's regime has 

done is turn ER rooms into those follow-up 

visits.

We've had that happen with both 

Dr. Jester, where a woman went to New Mexico and

 returned to Texas, as well as Dr. Johnson, where 

a woman went to Illinois and returned to

 Indiana.  Indeed, according to Guttmacher, one 

in five abortions take place out of state in

 certain states, like New Mexico, like Illinois, 

the border states in which our doctors reside.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Ms. Hawley, can I 

take you back to the affidavits and some of 

Justice Kagan's questions? 

You were talking about Dr. Francis. 

And as I read her allegations or her -- her --

as her affidavit reads, she said that her 

partner was forced to perform a D&C when there 

was a living fetus, and she said she performed a 

D&C on a woman who was suffering serious 

complications, but the fact that she performed a 

D&C does not necessarily mean that there was a 

living embryo or a fetus because you can have a 

D&C after, you know, a miscarriage. 

So, if that's right, I mean, I think 

the -- difficulty here is that at least to me, 

these affidavits do read more like the 

conscientious -- the objection is strictly to

 the life of the embryo or fetus, and I don't 

read either Skop or Francis to say that they 

ever participated in that.

 So do you want to address that?

 MS. HAWLEY: Sure.  So -- so, first, 

Justice Barrett, I think Dr. Francis's, combined 

with CMDA, can be read for the broader

 conscience harm.  Again, that's how the district 

court up -- understood that. I'd point you to 

pages 7 and 8. That's how both the state panel 

and the Fifth Circuit understood Respondents' 

conscience harms to extend beyond simply 

requiring the ending of an unborn life. 

And with respect to -- to even the 

more narrow conscience harm, to whether a doctor 

may need to end a life, we think there's still a 

substantial risk of that occurring.  If you look 

at the numbers of the increase from 7 to 10 

weeks in gestational age, that means that 

3.1 percent of pregnancies will be ongoing, 

requiring a D&C.  We know at JA -- or, excuse 

me, ROA 870, that 55 percent of those D&Cs occur 

in the emergency room. 

This is a substantial number of women

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But not all of those

 D&Cs will involve a pregnancy that would 

otherwise be viable or an embryo or a fetus that

 would otherwise be living, because you can have 

complications or excessive bleeding even after 

the abortion is complete in that respect, but 

there's pregnancy tissue remaining? 

MS. HAWLEY: So with the 3.1, Your

MS. HAWLEY: Yes, Your Honor.  I'd

conscience harm to be either taking the life of 

an unborn child, which would sometimes be 

required, Dr. Francis testifies to a partner who 

was required to do that because of emergency

completing in the terms of our declaration an

that hard to see why that might be a conscience 

harm if you think about what's involved in a

 D&C.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you just said, 

again, it's being involved in completing an

 elective abortion, so I -- I took that to be the 

conscience objection. 

I think what Justice Jackson is asking 

or what I asked before or what Justice Barrett 

is, is there any broader conscience objection 

that appears -- I don't -- I'm not sure I care 

all that much about the district court, but that 

appears in the declarations? 

MS. HAWLEY: Yes, Your Honor.  And --

and in this sense, completing an elective 

abortion means removing an embryo, a fetus, 

whether or not they're alive, as well as 

placental tissue.  Again, Dr. Francis talks 

about being required to perform a D&C -- this is 

at 154 --

there's any live tissue?

 MS. HAWLEY: Yes, Your Honor.  And, 

again, this makes sense --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and -- and

 where are we looking for that?

 MS. HAWLEY: So I would point Your 

Honor to JA 155, paragraph 15, where, again, she 

talks about completing an abortion.  The CMDA 

declaration at pages 142 and 143 also describe 

this sort of complicity harm from being involved 

in -- in an elective abortion, Your Honor. 

And, again, these doctors performing a 

D&C must scrape out a woman's uterus of -- of a 

child, the embryo, the fetus, or placental 

tissue.  And this Court has recognized harms 

like that in cases like Little Sisters of the 

Poor as well as Hobby Lobby.

 doctor's there, the person is having an

 emergency procedure.  My understanding is, with

 some of these chemical abortion scenarios, the

 completion occurs by prescribing additional

 medication.

 Do you have a sense of how many times 

the completion is that route and could be done 

by another physician as opposed to your clients 

and doing a -- a medical procedure? 

MS. HAWLEY: So -- so that second 

dose, Your Honor, of misoprostol has been part 

of the regimen since 2016, really I think all 

the way back to 2001, but -- but it's been 

approved by FDA since 2016.  So the best numbers 

we have from FDA are still consistent with that, 

and that means that 3.1 percent of pregnancies 

at 10 weeks will be ongoing. 

I -- I'd encourage you to look at --

at JA 405 through 407, and this explains that 

these risks go up without an in-person visit. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, no, I guess

 you are describing.

 MS. HAWLEY: So Dr. Skop talks about 

doing this at least a dozen of times, either a 

D&C or a suction-aspiration abortion to remove, 

again, embryos, fetuses, or placental tissue.

 In -- in addition, Your Honor, if you

 think about the numbers, again, it says 

3.1 percent at 10 weeks, and this has only gone 

up. In 2020, FDA told this Court that the 

in-person visit was both "necessary and 

minimally burdensome" and necessary to preserve 

women's health precisely so these sorts of 

situations occur less frequently.

 With respect to the Comstock Act as 

relevant here, the Comstock Act says that drugs 

should not be mailed through the -- either 

through the mail or through common carriers. So 

we think that the plain text of that, Your

 Honor, is pretty clear.

 JUSTICE THOMAS: When did you first

 raise the -- the Comstock Act? 

MS. HAWLEY: So I believe the Comstock 

Act was first raised at -- at the district 

court, Your Honor.  But we think that exhaustion 

does not apply for two reasons. 

First, it would be plainly futile, as 

FDA's adoption of the OLC memorandum goes.  In 

addition, this is a whole 'nother kettle of 

fish. But, if you look at Section 704, adoption 

or -- excuse me -- exhaustion is only required 

in two instances, either when required by a 

statute or when an -- by an agency rule when 

that agency rule is stayed pending litigation. 

This is consistent with this Court's 

case in Darby.  The -- the lower courts have 

taken conflicting opinions.  But we think the 

better reading of Section 704 is that there is

prove, that you have to show that that injury is 

traceable to the 2016 and 2021 FDA actions --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that you're 

challenging.  And, of course, that means showing 

that these incidents that you're talking about 

in the emergency room are caused by whatever 

incremental increase in risk there is as a 

result of those 2016 and 2021 actions. 

And I guess my first question is, do 

you agree with that statement of what you need 

to show?  And, if you do, how do you satisfy 

that? Why do you satisfy that?

Kagan, under the case law that -- that we need

 to show that -- that each of the 2016 action and

 the 2021 action increased the risk of harm.  And 

we think the way --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that -- I guess 

what I'm saying is that you have to link

 whatever injury your members have to that

 increased risk.  Do you agree with that?

 MS. HAWLEY: We do, and we think we 

can do that for a couple of reasons.  First of 

all, traceability, of course, is de facto. 

We're not in the Palsgraf sort of world of -- of 

tort causation. 

And when you look at the 2021 action, 

we think traceability is satisfied by FDA's own 

words. It says at JA 405 that without the 

in-person visit -- this is the Anger study --

in-person -- without that in-person visits, ER 

and other medical care is likely to increase, as 

well as surgical interventions.  And these are 

the very same surgical interventions that harm 

Respondent clients. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So there's -- there 

might be some dispute between the two of you as 

to exactly how big the increased risk is, but

let's even take your view that there is, you

 know, some measurable increased risk.

 How do you connect that risk to 

particular actions that your members have -- to 

particular injuries that your members have

 undergone or imminently will undergo?

 MS. HAWLEY: I --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it could be --

           MS. HAWLEY: I think --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- you know, the --

the -- the -- the original risk. 

MS. HAWLEY: So I think the 

declarations are actually quite clear on this. 

If you look at Dr. Francis's declaration, she 

says that when the in-person visit was enjoined 

in 2020 by a federal district court that she saw 

an increase in emergency room visits from 

abortion drug harm.  Dr. Johnson, Dr. Skop say 

the same thing. 

And, again, this is entirely 

consistent with FDA's own numbers.  Again, in 

2020, FDA told this Court that the in-person 

visit was necessary to preserve women's health 

because an in-person exam -- visit is the best 

opportunity to examine for things like ectopic

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Gorsuch?

 Justice Kavanaugh?

 Justice Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So General Prelogar

 said that that initial in-person visit did --

had no requirement of an ultrasound or, you 

know, any effort to detect fetal heartbeat, so 

it wouldn't necessarily give an accurate read on 

gestational age or detect an ectopic pregnancy. 

So why would that necessarily -- the elimination 

-- why would the elimination of the visit 

necessarily increase the risks? 

MS. HAWLEY: So I think, Your Honor, 

FDA's own data shows that those risks did go up. 

If you look at the Kerestes study, it shows a 

nearly threefold increase in emergency room 

visits when you have the in-person visit and 

when you removed it. There was 5.8 percent with 

an in-person visit, and it was also -- and about 

2.1 without.

hey, it would be a good idea to give you an 

ultrasound or try to detect a fetal heartbeat or

 what?

 MS. HAWLEY: So -- so, when FDA

 removed the in-person visit, Your Honor, it took 

away the opportunity to do that. I think ACOG 

-- I think medical organizations agree that that 

is best practice, so if a woman comes into a

 doctor's office, she's likely to get an 

ultrasound to accurately assess both ectopic 

pregnancies, diagnose or assess gestational age. 

But -- but what's allowed under FDA's 

rules currently is to be able to order these 

online with a couple of screening questions, and 

I don't think that's nearly as good as an 

in-person exam.

 MS. HAWLEY: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

So putting to one side the citizen petition, the

 AAPLOG declaration is clear that Respondent

 organizations conducted studies and analyzed

 studies.  This included going through the 

Medicaid data. It included going through the 

FAERS data to the extent it was available.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  That it? 

MS. HAWLEY: Well -- well, those 

studies, Your Honor, I -- I would point to you, 

one of them is at ROA 5 -- excuse me -- ROA 870 

and before and after, and those are pretty 

comprehensive studies, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And are they to the 

end of the litigation and the citizen petition, 

or what are they to the end of? 

MS. HAWLEY: To accurately assess the 

harm from abortion drugs, Your Honor.  So I 

think it's absolutely separate from the 

litigation. 

And one thing to note with the citizen 

petition is that is the only way in which anyone 

can raise a -- a concern to the FDA. These 

proceedings go on between Danco and the FDA

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what deference, 

if any, do courts owe the opinion of the expert

 agency concerning the safety and efficacy of 

drugs? 

MS. HAWLEY: So, under this Court's 

administrative procedure precedents, Your Honor, 

APA review, of course, is not toothless. 

Instead, in this case, we're not asking that the 

Court second-guess the agency determinations at 

all but, rather, look at what FDA said. 

Again, in 2021, when FDA took away the 

in-person visit, it did so based on FAERS data 

it says elsewhere cannot be used to calculate 

the instance of an adverse event, as well as 

studies that says that JA 407 are "not 

adequate." 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess I don't 

understand how that scope of review is not 

second-guessing the agency.  I mean, they're

looking at studies and you're saying that the

 Court can look at studies, maybe different 

studies, maybe the same studies, and critique

 their conclusions about them.

 So what -- what deference do we owe 

them at all with respect to their assessment 

that these studies establish what it is that 

they say they do about safety and efficacy?

 MS. HAWLEY: I don't think that's an 

accurate portrayal of the -- the APA claim at 

issue here, Your Honor, and the reason being, 

again, is we're just asking this Court to look 

at what FDA said.  The FDCA says you have to 

have adequate tests and test results, as well as 

sufficient information. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I understand.  But 

didn't the lower courts go beyond that? I mean, 

representations were made here today that the 

lower courts actually relied on studies that 

have since been found discredited and removed. 

So they were obviously looking at not just what 

the FDA was looking at in order to make their 

assessment. 

So are you asking us to just look at 

the FDA and not anything else?

MS. HAWLEY: So -- so, yes. That

 claim is not even before this Court.  But, with 

respect to the two claims that are before the

 Court, the 2016 and the 2021, we think the FDA's 

own statements here are -- are arbitrary.

 In 2016, what the FDA said was we're 

going to look at individual studies and then, 

even though we say they're interrelated at JA 

298, we're going to take all of the protections 

away at once. 

That was arbitrary in State Farm. It

there will be a future injury, but it can be a

 source of information.

 And, here, what is so telling is that 

Respondents don't have a specific example of any 

doctor ever having to violate this care in

 violation of their conscience.  Instead, 

Respondents have pointed to generalized 

assertions in the declarations that never come

 out and specifically say by one of their 

identified members:  Here's the care I provided, 

here's how it violated my conscience, and here 

is why conscience protections were unavailable 

to me. 

The fact that they don't have a doctor 

who's willing to submit that kind of sworn 

declaration in court, I think, demonstrates that 

the past harm hasn't happened, and the reason 

for that is because it is so speculative and 

turns on so many links in the chain that would 

have to occur and at the end would be 

backstopped by having the federal conscience 

protections in play. 

On organizational standing, my friend 

has pointed to the fact that they invested time 

in preparing their citizen petition.  She says

they voluntarily conducted studies and then

 generally refers to diversion of resources.

 If that is enough, then every

 organization in this country has standing to

 challenge any federal policy they dislike.

 Havens Realty cannot possibly mean that.  The 

Court should say so and clarify it is at the

 outer bounds and Respondents don't qualify under

 that standard. 

On remedy, Justice Gorsuch, Justice 

Jackson, you pointed out the striking anomaly 

here of the nationwide nature of this remedy. 

Justice Jackson, you suggested maybe a more 

tailored remedy to the parties protecting their 

conscience protections should have been entered. 

The problem here is they sued the FDA. 

FDA has nothing to do with enforcement of the 

conscience protections.  That's all happening 

far downstream at the hospital level.  And the 

only way to provide a remedy based on this 

theory of injury, therefore, was to grant this 

kind of nationwide relief that is so far removed 

from FDA's regulatory authority that it's 

ultimately requiring all women everywhere to 

change the conditions of use of this drug.

And I think it's worth stepping back 

finally and thinking about the profound mismatch 

between that theory of injury and the remedy

 that Respondents obtained.  They have said that 

they fear that there might be some emergency 

room doctor somewhere, someday, who might be

 presented with some woman who is suffering an

 incredibly rare complication and that the doctor

 might have to provide treatment notwithstanding 

the conscience protections.  We don't think that 

harm has materialized. 

But what the Court did to guard 

against that very remote risk is enter sweeping 

nationwide relief that restricts access to 

mifepristone for every single woman in this 

country, and that causes profound harm. 

It harms the agency, which had the 

federal courts come in and displace the agency's 

scientific judgments.  It harms the 

pharmaceutical industry, which is sounding alarm 

bells in this case and saying that this would 

destabilize the system for approving and 

regulating drugs.  And it harms women who need 

access to medication abortion under the 

conditions that FDA determined were safe and
