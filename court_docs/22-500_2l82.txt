 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-500, Great Lakes

 Insurance versus Raiders Retreat Realty.

 Mr. Wall.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

In The Bremen and Carnival, this Court 

held that forum-selection clauses in maritime 

contracts are enforceable as a matter of federal 

law, except in the rare circumstances when they 

violate federal maritime policy. 

Almost all federal courts, including 

all of the major maritime courts, have taken the 

same approach for choice-of-law clauses.  This 

Court should do the same for three reasons. 

First, logic and consistency.  We're 

here talking about a federal exception to a 

federal presumption of enforceability.  It 

stands to reason that federal exception would 

look to federal public policy, not state public 

policy.  Raiders doesn't point to any analogous

 federal exception.  It looks to state public

 policy.  And it doesn't explain why choice of

 law in maritime should be any different from

 forum selection in maritime.

 Second, the consensus approach makes 

practical sense for the reasons that this Court

 gave in The Bremen.  Judging choice-of-law 

clauses by reference to a uniform body of 

federal law accords with ancient concepts of 

freedom of contract, and it allows parties to 

gauge and price their risks knowing what law 

will apply to their contracts.  If 50 states may 

set aside parties' choices based on their own 

public policies, that would be a reference for 

uncertainty and forum shopping. 

Third, the consensus approach is clear 

and administrable.  On our approach, a federal 

court would ask, does a choice-of-law clause 

offend federal admiralty policy? The answer to 

that question will almost always be no. On 

Raiders' approach, the Court would ask, what's 

the state with the greatest interest in the 

dispute?  Does that state have a public policy 

with respect to the specific question at issue? 

And is that public policy fundamental?

So, for instance, you could have a

 Florida district court asking whether 

Pennsylvania has a fundamental public policy

 sufficient to overcome the application of New

 York law.  The answer to that will almost always 

be hazy, and that lack of clarity would disserve 

the admiralty world and federal courts.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Wall, what does 

-- what effect does Wilburn Boat have on your 

argument? 

MR. WALL:  So I -- I think you have to 

take Wilburn Boat as part of the background law. 

Wilburn Boat was a watershed decision, to be 

sure, and said state law occupies the space when 

there is no well-established rule of admiralty 

or no need to create one. 

But this Court saw no tension with 

Wilburn Boat in The Bremen or Carnival, where it 

said either there's a well-recognized rule in 

admiralty or we think we need to create one, 

whichever one the Court was doing, when it said 

forum-selection clauses are generally 

enforceable as a matter of federal law. 

So I see no tension between those two

 things.  The question just remains there was The 

-- Court in The Bremen perceived either a

 recognized rule in admiralty for forum selection

 or a need to create one.  And so the only 

question here is, should we have the same rule

 for choice-of-law clauses? I can't think of a 

single good reason why you would distinguish

 between the two.

 If anything, I would think it would be 

easier on the choice-of-law side because the 

forum-selection question can really affect the 

parties' practical ability to litigate.  The 

choice-of-law question is just, once you reach 

the forum, what law will the parties apply? 

It is worth noting, though, that I --

it's not as if, you know, Great Lakes picked out 

here South Dakota law or Mongolian law.  I mean, 

they picked out New York law.  That's a common 

choice among both marine insurers generally and

 that -- what then is the content of the federal 

exception? I think the briefs kind of dance 

around with a few different formulations.

 First of all, the Restatement.  Is

 that relevant?

 MR. WALL: So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Particularly 

Restatement 187(2)(b). I think you think that's 

out altogether, I think. 

MR. WALL: It -- I -- so I don't think 

that's right, Justice Kavanaugh. Just to take a 

step back, I think The Bremen did this exactly 

right. So, if it's narrow decision day, I mean, 

I think it's just --

(Laughter.) 

MR. WALL: -- the Third Circuit kind 

of got one little piece of The Bremen wrong. 

The Bremen said --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, assume it's 

not -- it -- that we're trying to figure this 

out. So -- yeah. 

MR. WALL: I -- yeah -- it -- I -- so 

I'm good with first principles.  So The Bremen

says two things. One, if it's contrary to 

public policy; and, two, it says maybe if 

there's no substantial connection to the chosen 

law or no reasonable basis for choosing that 

law. 

I think the court of appeals got --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So --

MR. WALL: -- all of that right. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- so the marine 

underwriters' amicus brief, which supports you 

but says that's no good, the substantial 

connection point, because they say that 

oftentimes sophisticated parties in this context 

are going to choose a neutral forum to which 

neither might have a substantial connection, so 

I just want to make sure.

point you made about if the state law offends

 federal admin -- admiralty policy, then, okay, 

but otherwise, don't do the Restatement. That

 seems to be their position.  I want to make sure

 you're clear on that.

 MR. WALL: I -- I think it's a little 

more nuanced than that, Justice Kavanaugh. What 

The Bremen says and what the Restatement says in 

that prong is -- and The Bremen cites this, I 

think, faithfully -- it says no substantial 

connection or no reasonable basis. 

And what the marine underwriters say 

is some courts, in picking that up, have just 

done the substantial connection and not looked 

to the reasonable basis. 

As long as you say that even if you're 

not connected to New York, though the parties 

were here, that that's a perfectly reasonable 

law --

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's not -- to

 MR. WALL: That's right.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.

 MR. WALL: And The Bremen got all of 

this right.  I mean, it -- the only place where 

the court of appeals went wrong was it said, 

okay, public policy can be one of the things 

that makes it unreasonable and unjust.  Whose 

public policy? We look to the state, which 

isn't what The Bremen did.  And it doesn't make 

a lot of sense. 

If you think there's a presumption of 

enforceability, then federal law cares about 

generally having them enforced.  When would it 

not want that to be true?  Well, when it 

disserves the purposes of maritime, not when it 

disserves one of the 50 states' idiosyncratic 

public policies.

-- of -- of, you know, asking you about Wilburn,

 because Wilburn seemed to say something

 different.  Wilburn seemed to say, you know, 

even when you're trying to figure out what the 

federal law should be in this area, I mean, 

federal law often says, well, the states have an 

extremely important role to play, and so it

 should be a state rule of decision.  That's a --

a federal rule that it should be a state rule of 

decision. 

That's essentially what Wilburn said 

in the insurance -- maritime insurance context. 

And most of your brief seems to be an effort to 

run away from that aspect of Wilburn repeated 

over and over and over again, which is, when it 

comes to maritime insurance, states have long 

regulated the area and strongly regulated the 

area, and the -- the federal rule is that we 

should allow that to continue. 

MR. WALL: So I -- two things, Justice 

Kagan. I understand that argument, and I think 

it has more force on the sort of new front-line 

position.

federal presumption of enforceability and we're 

just trying to figure out how to work the 

exception, then I think we sort of already 

passed Wilburn Boat because we have now a

 well-established federal rule. It's a

 presumption of enforceability. And we're just

 trying to figure out do -- what did The Bremen

 mean when it said public policy, what does the

 Restatement mean.  And we're sort of past 

Wilburn Boat. 

I -- I take the point more generally 

that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't really think 

so in anything other than a highly technical 

way. What Wilburn Boat said is that in crafting 

the exceptions to this presumption, you should 

take into account that states have long 

regulated maritime insurance and that they 

should continue to do so. 

MR. WALL: So I -- I don't think 

that's quite right, Justice Kagan.  It doesn't 

say anything about sort of how you work federal 

rules and once you have them in admiralty.  It 

says, if you have a rule in admiralty, you 

follow it or if you need to create one. And we

can debate whether The Bremen was recognizing an

 acknowledged rule or creating one.  I think it's 

possible to read the decision either way.

 And then Wilburn Boat tells you, if 

you don't have the federal rule or a need to 

create a uniform rule in order to serve the 

purposes of admiralty, state law does all the

 work there.

 And you're right, there's a lot of 

other sort of language and dicta about the --

the historical role that states have played with 

regard to regulating marine insurance, and --

and I'm not sort of here dickering with any of 

that, except to say The Bremen and Carnival 

didn't see any of that as a barrier to 

recognizing or creating a -- a uniform federal 

rule for forum selection. 

I don't take the other side to be 

disputing that or saying those decisions should 

be overruled.  And so the question just is, all 

right, we have that rule in admiralty which 

applies to forum selection clauses across the 

board, all maritime contracts.  Doesn't matter 

whether they're marine insurance or not.

 typically travel together in maritime contracts

 like this one?  And I don't really think Wilburn 

Boat has much to say on that question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your 

argument, I take it, is that there is an 

established federal maritime rule not simply on

 choice-of-law provisions but, I don't know, the

that even if your boat runs aground, you know, 

if you didn't have the fire extinguisher, you 

know, updated, you -- you lose. 

What if there weren't an established 

maritime policy on that specific doctrine? 

MR. WALL: So a -- a couple of things, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  I don't know that uberrimae 

fidei is the sort of rule that's triggered here 

as much as strict enforcement of the warranties. 

It is true that post-Wilburn Boat, 

some of those, like uberrimae fidei or 

Navigational Limits, courts have almost 

uniformly said are controlled by federal law 

because they were well-established rules in 

admiralty.

 state law. That's the substantive state law.

 So it is true that post-Wilburn Boat 

federal law is going to control some of the

 contractual provisions.  State law will control

 others.  But I don't think it makes any 

difference to our argument, which is that the 

question here is about the enforceability of a

 choice-of-law clause, and on that, there is a 

well-established rule.

made -- and I'm -- I think it's the argument of 

your friend on the other side -- that Wilburn 

Boat is expressly designed to do what you 

indicated that it doesn't matter, which is, if 

you have a very particular question like how the 

insurance policy should be interpreted, and 

there's no federal rule.  There are general

 Boat, you do look to state law.

 MR. WALL: I -- I agree with that, Mr.

going to go to state law. The question is,

 which state law?  Do we give effect to the 

choice-of-law clause? 

And there is a rule on choice-of-law 

clauses in admiralty, and it's as 

well-established as it can be absent a 

pronouncement from this Court.  It goes back to 

London Assurance and Kensington in 1897 and 

1902. 

Then you find this Court saying it for 

forum selection in Bremen and Carnival.  Then 

you have virtually every federal court, 

including the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits and 

all the major maritime district courts, adopting 

it for choice of law. 

It is as well-established in admiralty 

as it can be absent a decision of this Court.

way this case was litigated is that everyone 

assumed and kind of took as a given that there

 was this well-established federal rule that

 choice-of-law clause -- clauses were 

presumptively enforceable, and it has changed 

its position now. But, below, am I right that 

Raiders took that as a given? 

MR. WALL: Yes. And -- but that's a 

-- I -- it -- it's not just about Raiders, 

Justice Barrett.  It's just a reflection of the 

way these cases are litigated.  Every one for 

decades has taken it as a given that The Bremen 

applies with respect to forum selection and 

choice of law. 

And everybody had been thinking 

federal public -- public policy. And then they 

made the argument about state public policy, and 

in our view, the Third Circuit got that wrong. 

But everybody had been doing this 

within the framework of The -- The Bremen just 

for maritime contracts for forum selection for 

choice of law, and so everybody thought there 

was a federal presumption across the board.  And 

then it was just, what are the exceptions to the 

presumption?

JUSTICE ALITO:  And, Mr. Wall, there's

 a -- a wonderful line in your brief.  Now this

 is a -- a case about a yacht that ran aground, 

and when the claim is filed, your client denies

 the claim because you say they didn't do what

 they were supposed to do regarding fire

 extinguishers.

 But there was no fire. The -- the

 absence of fire extinguishers up to your 

standards had nothing whatsoever to do with 

this. And so you have this line -- and so to 

deny coverage on that ground does seem harsh, 

but you say:  Although that denial may seem 

harsh to the land-bound, it reflects traditional 

maritime principles. 

Now, if I were not land-bound, suppose 

I -- you know, I -- I spent a lot of time 

sailing around the world on ships, it wouldn't 

seem harsh to me anymore? 

MR. WALL: It would not if you were a 

member of the admiralty bar as I've come to 

understand.  Justice Alito, I've always been 

worried about this because it struck me as harsh 

too when I approached the case.  There is a 

different tradition that grew up around the

admiralty system and Lloyd's of London.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  I know there

 are a lot of things about old-time maritime law

 that are very harsh.  Like, we had a case a few

 years ago about maintenance and cure of seamen, 

and we had cases and -- we had a case involving

 a -- a sailor who got a fractured skull shortly

 after leaving port, and then the captain

 refused -- made the entire journey, refused to 

put the person aboard -- ashore at any port to 

get medical treatment, waited until the person 

came home. 

So I -- I mean, I don't know about --

MR. WALL: And no punitive damages. 

But I -- the reason for this, Justice Alito, is 

that you had international insurers located 

overseas who had no way of monitoring these 

vessels or incentivizing compliance. 

And so this tradition grew up and it's 

very different from what we think of a car 

insurance or home insurance, where you pay your 

premiums and they process the claims in the 

pool. These are sort of specialized policies. 

And -- and so just to put a little 

finer point on it, Great Lakes is a surplus

before, but it turns out you go to them when 

your other insurers won't take you.

 So you can't get your boat policy from 

Progressive or GEICO, it may be risky, maybe, as 

here, the boat is very expensive, you want a big 

policy, so it's a sort of -- it's a unique 

transaction that others in the market don't do.

 There aren't many of them. 

And they have to price these things, 

and they price them by taking into account that 

you will have to comply with the warranties, 

which is why, here, you can get a million 

dollars of coverage on a half-million-dollar 

yacht for a premium of about $9,000 a year. 

That's the policy --

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right. 

MR. WALL: -- in the record. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So suppose this --

this choice-of-law clause were modified, and the 

phrase, "the substantive laws of the State of 

New York" were deleted, and in its place were 

put -- was put "the substantive laws of some 

fall" -- "some little country that has the most 

pro-insurer law you can possibly imagine."

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- can I just ask 

you, because I was a little surprised about your

 reliance on The Bremen under the Wilbur --

Wilburn Boat standard. I understand that step 1 

is that it has to be an established federal

 rule, but I also thought that the rule that

 you're -- are asking be recognized as such in 

this context has never been laid down by this

 Court in the choice-of-law context.  The Bremen 

was forum selection. 

So can you just help me to understand 

how we know that there's an established federal 

rule in the choice-of-law world? 

MR. WALL: Well, there wasn't an 

established rule laid down by this Court 

pre-Bremen either, Justice Jackson. And what 

the Court said in The Bremen was we -- all of 

the purposes of maritime -- the need for 

uniformity, predictability, a -- facilitating 

the free flow of national and international 

commerce -- all of those things lead us to say 

that forum-selection clauses should be generally 

enforceable as a matter of federal law. 

So I think, here, you are right 

there's no decision from this Court on choice of

courts, you have a virtual consensus among all

 the present-day courts, all the major maritime

 ones, and you already have Bremen and Carnival.

 So you already know what the rule is

 with respect to forum selection, and it's thus,

MR. WALL: I do but not in a way that 

helps Raiders.  I mean, historically, what 

courts were skeptical of was forum selection 

because they thought you picked the foreign 

forum and then forced the parties to go litigate 

there, which was effectively trying to deprive 

them of their ability to access the forum.  But 

courts were not so hostile to parties picking 

choice of law. 

And so it seems to me that once you've 

done it with respect to forum selection, that 

was the harder question historically. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But was it harder 

with respect to this issue of federal versus 

state? I mean, I would think that the

 forum-selection scenario is easier when you're

 talking about picking among states than the

 question of federal to state, which is what is

 happening in this dynamic with respect to choice

 of law.

 MR. WALL: So I think I disagree with

 that, Justice Jackson.  I don't see a difference

 for Wilburn Boat purposes.  And, if anything, 

it's less clear to me that the law on forum 

selection in admiralty was well-established as 

of the time of The Bremen as it is that there's 

a well-established rule on choice of law now 

that would -- existed both pre- and post-Bremen. 

So I -- I think this is an easier case than The 

Bremen in sort of both of those -- in both of 

those senses. 

And I do just want to say, Justice 

Jackson, I -- I see the problems, and the 

Restatement acknowledges and so does The Bremen, 

if you pick out some really odd law, right, 

that's just designed to mean they have no 

remedy.  But, here, they picked out a standard 

law that gives them remedies.  They still have 

two claims.  They have traditional contract 

remedies, breach of contract, breach of the

 The only thing they don't have are the

 more idiosyncratic Pennsylvania claims.  But,

 again, it's not as if Great Lakes picked out 

some law in an effort to -- for it to be unfair.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you can call it

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  What if it did --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- idiosyncratic, but 

what they really are is consumer-protective as 

against insurance companies in situations of 

this kind.  And, you know, we know that there's 

no federal substantive principle that conflicts 

with those Pennsylvania statutes. 

So the question is, as between two 

state laws, why we should necessarily allow the 

New York law to apply when everything about this 

case screams Pennsylvania.  And I would have 

thought that what Wilburn Boats stands for, 

again, in its essence, is, you know, when that's 

so, it should be the state regulating insurance 

that gets to have its way.

Carnival, I think we'd clearly be right.

 So then the question is, well, which

 distinction makes more sense?  Distinguishing 

between forum selection and choice of law or 

distinguishing between maritime insurance and

 other maritime contracts?

 And I think what the other side's 

position boils down to -- and maybe I'm wrong --

is that if you have a bill of lading, you're 

shipping goods from Europe to the United States, 

and you have a shipping contract, you have a 

towage into the port contract, you have 

employment contracts for the seamen, whether 

under Jones Act or otherwise, and you have a 

marine insurance contract, I think they're going 

to have to acknowledge all the forum-selection 

clauses in all the contract generally 

enforceable except as against federal public 

policy. 

On the non-marine-insurance contracts, 

I think they're going to have to say still the 

same test as forum selection, but for the one 

choice-of-law -- clause in the one marine 

insurance contract, you'd look at Wilburn Boat

 role. That seems to me not a sensible result.

 And I guess the -- I want to sort of 

broaden the lens. You started by saying this is

 a dispute between two state laws.  And that is 

the way the other side sees it. But I think 

that ignores a third set of laws, federal law.

 And if we're right on the question 

that the Court didn't grant, that there's a 

federal presumption of enforceability, then 

federal law does have something to say here.  It 

says we want the clauses to be generally 

enforced, except fill in the blank.  And who 

gets to fill in the blank?  The federal 

sovereign that recognized the presumption --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the federal 

sovereign --

MR. WALL: -- or 50 states? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- may get to fill in 

the blank and still say the presumption is 

overridden in a case where everything screams 

Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania has substantive

 about whether it's against federal public 

policy, you say, well, they want it to be

 enforced.

 MR. WALL:  Unless the chosen law 

deprives the parties of remedies altogether or 

forces them to go to a really far forum or 

adopts some limitations on liability that

 disserve the purposes of admiralty.  So courts 

don't allow you to pick out a law if your chosen 

law says, you know, the shipper or the insurer 

can only be liable for $5 or you effectively 

have no claim at all. So, if we deprive you of 

remedies or we put limitations in place that 

fail to deter negligence, federal courts say 

that triggers admiralty policy. 

But short of that, they're generally 

enforceable.  So I'll be the first one to say 

most of these clauses are going to be 

enforceable because the standard clause if you 

look across the cases is this one.  So, if you 

look at Galilea, that's a different insurer.  If 

you look at Clear Spring, the standard is 

entrenched federal admiralty law or, failing 

that, New York law.  That's the standard clause.

 court could.  The problem is, if you look at the 

considerations that this Court put forward in 

your opinion for the Court in Dutra for how 

federal admiralty courts either recognize or 

make federal common law in admiralty, I think

 they're going to cut away from Pennsylvania 

because they cut in favor of enforcing the 

warranties, not in favor of sort of, you know, 

lax or lenient compliance. 

But, if the history were different and 

if a court thought it served the purposes of 

admiralty, of course, it could create a rule 

like that.  But I -- I -- I -- I want to be 

candid and say I -- I think the history of 

admiralty and most decisions go the other way on 

that. 

But it -- there's not a federal rule 

on the specific issue here.  Like, that's 

navigational limits, federal.  As it's turned 

out, fire extinguishers, state.  So, I -- you 

know, I'm not -- not fighting that that goes to 

state law. It's just a question of does the 

parties' choice of New York law get to govern 

that question. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why does Wilburn 

Boat even apply here or to this question at all?

 I'm not sure it does.  So --

MR. WALL: I'd be perfectly happy with 

an opinion that says it doesn't, but in fairness

 to -- to Justice Kagan, if you just picked up 

Wilburn Boat, it would tell you that if you 

don't have an established federal rule or you 

don't need to create one, you look to state law. 

And if you read the opinion, you'd 

think, in marine insurance, the bar for that 

would be really high.  So, if you didn't have 

Bremen and Carnival, I think it would be a 

harder case whether there would be an on-point 

rule here that you could look to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we limited 

it in Kossick and Kirby. 

MR. WALL: So -- look, I agree.  The 

Court comes along six years after it in -- in 

Kossick, it recognizes a federal rule in 

admiralty, it in dicta has some fairly critical 

things to say about Wilburn Boat. 

It seems to side with the concurrence

 question whether it's right.  But I didn't --

you know, we're not biting off the holburn --

 holding of -- of -- of Wilburn Boat.

 I mean, I -- you know, I do think

 there are the good reasons to be critical of the

 decision.  I do think that its historical 

discussion does not match up with the history in 

-- in admiralty, and I think it was -- it was a 

little thin there. 

And Justice Frankfurter's concurrence 

has a lot to recommend it, but, I -- I don't 

sort of need to win that to be -- to -- to 

prevail here. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I guess then 

you need to win the debate that there's an 

established presumption of enforceability for 

conflict-of-law choices, correct? 

MR. WALL: Yes, that debate I need to 

win. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.

say is I have everything on my side except a

a near consensus in the -- before the federal 

courts on federal choice of law.

 So I have everything except this Court

 confirming, yes, the rule for forum selection 

applies equally to choice of law, which, by the

 way, even the Third Circuit didn't dispute.

 Again, on sort of narrowest grounds of 

decision, the Third Circuit got it right all the 

way up until the end, where it said, under the 

public policy prong, you look to state rather 

than federal.  If you just said it's federal 

rather than state under The Bremen, period, 

we're done. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kagan? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, if the plaintiff 

here were an airline company or a railroad or a 

trucking concern, probably the Restatement rule 

applies, probably Pennsylvania law applies 

because of it. 

Why is this so different? 

MR. WALL: Well, it may.  In some of 

those industries, I mean, you have the Federal 

Aviation Act.  I mean, there are federal 

statutes in a lot of those.  There is a federal

 trucking.  I mean, it's not that all of those 

are just sort of left to state law.

 But I do agree with you that outside

 of maritime, you -- the -- the Restatement is 

going to run the traditional way because it's

 not federal enclave, and it will run as between

 the states.  And I -- I -- I think, Justice 

Kagan, it's fundamental to our position that 

maritime is different and has long had a 

different set of rules. 

And this Court has sort of confirmed 

again and again and Wilburn Boat says what --

you know, even Wilburn Boat says:  Well, but if 

there's a recognized federal rule or a need to 

create one, no state law.  And that's different 

about maritime from all of these other areas. 

So I -- it -- it seems to me, yes, 

admiralty is different.

exceptions, again, if we agree with you that the 

exceptions are determined by federal law, and I 

think you've said then it's just about the 

exceptions, well, you don't necessarily need to 

be precise to win the case for your client, but 

we need to be precise in how we write the

 opinion, and so I want to ask two things.

 One, you don't think that as a matter 

of federal policy on exceptions we should look 

to which state might have a materially greater 

interest than the chosen state in the 

determination of the particular issue, correct? 

MR. WALL: No. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And, 

secondly, you've mentioned a couple times if the 

chosen state law deprives the insured of 

remedies, and I didn't see that in the brief, 

but that might be something you're elaborating 

on reasonable basis, or where is that coming 

from? 

MR. WALL: No, sorry, I -- I -- I 

thought we tried to say it in both of the briefs 

but maybe not very clearly.  It does not come up 

very often because, as I say, the standard 

choice is entrenched admiralty law or New York

 So these public policy arguments don't 

tend to play themselves out because nobody 

thinks that New York law is repugnant to federal

 law. But, in the cases where it has come up,

 where you've picked some -- and there aren't

 many of them -- what courts have tended to say 

is, if you have limitations on liability that

 fail to deter negligence --

law, say it just chooses New York law, I just 

want to make sure I understand this, and New

MR. WALL: New York law is not 

repugnant to federal policy because there is no 

evidence in this case or any other that it 

limits liability of marine insurers in a way 

that fails to deter negligence or otherwise 

deprives insureds of -- of any remedy.

again, courts haven't had to confront it in a 

case where you had some remedies, but they 

didn't allow you to get at it. In all of these 

cases, because you have New York law, you have 

the standard contract remedies under New York

 law.

 They can claim that Great Lakes is

 breaching.  They can claim that Great Lakes

 breached an implied duty of good faith and fair 

dealing.  That's typically enough for them to be 

able to air these claims in court. 

So, I mean, again, they picked out New 

York law.  I mean, this is not a --

MR. WALL: -- idiosyncratic or weird 

law, so it doesn't tend to come up. But, if you 

picked out a state's law that didn't allow you a 

remedy for your particular claim, I -- it would 

come up. 

I will say, Justice Kavanaugh, I've 

read more of these cases than I care to admit,

true.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD J. BASHMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BASHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 In this maritime insurance case, the 

Court considers whether a state choice-of-law 

provision in an insurance policy is subject to 

the same fundamental public policy exception 

that applies everywhere outside of admiralty or 

whether only a strong federal public policy will 

suffice to overcome the insurance company's 

state choice-of-law clause. 

The Third Circuit reached the correct 

result here for two reasons.  First, under 

Wilburn Boat, state law applies. As a result, 

the fundamental public policy of the state with 

the greatest connection to the dispute can 

override the contractual choice-of-law 

provision, selecting the law of another state. 

And, second, should this Court see a 

need to announce a federal common law rule to

govern these circumstances, notwithstanding

 Wilburn's Boat -- Wilburn Boat's decision to

 leave maritime insurance regulation to the 

states and to Congress, which has opted not to

 intervene, this Court should adopt Restatement

 Second Conflict of Laws, Section 187, as the

 federal rule.

 By contrast, the rule that Great Lakes

 urges is neither a judicially established 

federal maritime insurance rule, nor is it even 

a rules created for the circumstances of this 

case. Great Lakes' rule arose in the vertical 

choice-of-law scenario involving whether parties 

to a non-insurance maritime contract could 

replace applicable substantive federal admiralty 

law with the state law they preferred instead. 

This case, on the other hand, involves 

a horizontal choice-of-law inquiry between the 

laws of two co-equal states. Both sides agree 

that substantive federal admiralty law does not 

preclude Raiders' Pennsylvania law 

counterclaims.  So why should federal public 

policy impact or restrict the choice-of-law 

analysis in any way? 

I welcome the Court's questions.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, you seem to 

rely quite a bit on Wilburn, but we've had 

Kossick and Kirby since then, and you seem to 

shy away from those two cases that seem to 

suggest that we've cut back on Wilburn.

 MR. BASHMAN: I -- I don't think that 

in the area involved in this case that I see any 

consensus in the lower federal courts that 

Wilburn Boat has, in fact, been cut back upon. 

So -- so we believe that -- that it fully 

applies to the circumstances of this case, which 

-- which is, again, maritime insurance. 

And -- and, in fact, by arguing that 

only federal policy can defeat a maritime 

insurance policy state choice-of-law clause, my 

friend on the other side is not merely seeking 

to evade Wilburn Boat but to affirmatively use 

it to harm policyholders, exactly the opposite 

result of what that case was seeking to achieve. 

It's because of the Wilburn Boat 

decision to leave maritime insurance regulation 

to the states that neither this Court nor other 

federal courts have been making federal policy 

relevant to the enforcement of -- of maritime 

insurance terms and conditions.

Using the absence of such federal

 maritime insurance policy against insurance

 policyholders, Great Lakes would leave such 

policyholders worse off than if Wilburn --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well --

MR. BASHMAN: -- Boat never even was

 decided.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- the -- Wilburn was

 a little bit different.  I mean, you -- you had 

two states there.  You had Texas and Oklahoma. 

It's a -- it's landlocked lake.  And I think 

Justice Frankfurter pointed out the problem of 

taking a case about a houseboat on a -- on a 

lake too far and applying it to maritime 

shipping would be a problem. 

And it's -- would seem that Kossick 

and Kirby reflects that concern. 

MR. BASHMAN: Well -- well, again, you 

know, my -- my answer is that the core holding 

of Wilburn Boat in -- in my understanding of it 

has remained good law. And so -- and I think 

that, you know, certainly, there was no issue in 

Wilburn Boat about whether there were a majority 

of justices that supported the majority opinion. 

There -- there was.

 need and -- and not some just otherwise 

applicable maritime law that applies outside of

 insurance.

 For -- for example, if the first case

 that came before this Court were to decide in --

in the non-insurance context when should a

 choice-of-law clause be enforceable or not,

 that, for purposes of Wilburn Boat, is not a 

holding that -- that would necessarily be 

applicable in the insurance context.  Wilburn 

Boat recognized, for lack of a better term, a 

sort of insurance exceptionalism where -- where 

this Court will defer to the states. 

The -- the -- also, those two cases 

did not involve choice of law. The Bremen 

tangentially recognized that choice of forum 

might control choice of law.  But -- but, as my 

friend on the other side has conceded, those --

those are two different things.  And if 

someone's going to ask me, you know, what's the 

difference between choice of law and choice of 

forum or forum-selection clause, I mean, I -- I 

think that essentially, it's -- it's 

self-evident.

 a difference if -- if you lose in other

presented in this case --

outcome determinative.

 Insurance policy says the insured cannot bring

 insurance bad-faith claims.  It cannot bring

 state unfair trade practices claims, which is 

what they're saying the work that the New York

 choice-of-law provision accomplishes for them.

 Under Wilburn Boat, where you have

 substantive provisions, which is precisely what 

Wilburn -- Wilburn Boat involved, you can't sell 

the boat, you can't use it for commercial 

purposes, this Court recognized that otherwise 

applicable law could override those substantive 

provisions.  Why -- why the outcome should be 

different where it's accomplished through a 

choice-of-law clause, the -- the other side

was a presumption of enforceability to the

 choice-of-law -- clause.  That's what I thought 

when we granted cert. And then I was confused 

when I started reading your brief and it was all

 about Wilburn Boat.

 MR. BASHMAN: I looked at the cites 

that the other side had in its reply brief for

 the proposition that -- that we had admitted

 that -- that choice-of-law is presumptively 

enforceable as a matter of federal law, and none 

of those establish any such thing. 

Raiders' Third Circuit briefs did not 

agree that a choice-of-law clause is 

presumptively enforceable as a matter of federal 

law. The term doesn't even appear in those 

briefs. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Did you accept it as 

a premise, even -- even if you didn't say --

even if you didn't affirmatively make the 

argument, you know, these are presumptively 

enforceable under federal law?  I mean, it seems 

to me that was the premise of the QP. It seems 

like that was the premise below. It was 

certainly the premise of the Third Circuit's 

decision.

 don't have it at hand, but -- but my

 recollection of it is whether state law is -- is

 relevant to -- to determining whether a -- a

 state choice-of-law provision in -- in a

 maritime insurance contract --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  It says:  "[...] can 

a choice-of-law clause in a maritime contract be 

rendered unenforceable if enforcement is 

contrary to the 'strong public policy' of the 

state whose law is displaced?"  So that kind of 

-- "Under federal" -- sorry, I omitted the --

the key first clause.  "Under federal admiralty 

law, can a choice-of-law clause" -- the rest of 

what I said. 

MR. BASHMAN: Right.  They put a lot 

of weight on that introductory phrase that Your 

Honor omitted.  And -- and our answer is Wilburn 

Boat is a federal admiralty law case.  Our 

argument under Wilburn Boat step 2 that's --

even take it -- well, I guess I should ask, do 

you accept Justice Kagan's premise that Wilburn 

Boat adopted state substantive law as the 

federal common law rule, or is it your position 

that Wilburn Boat said this is a state law 

matter and federal law has nothing to say?

 MR. BASHMAN: I -- I don't know that 

there's a whole lot of difference between those

 two --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I think there's a 

difference. 

MR. BASHMAN: -- positions.  But --

but what Wilburn Boat said, as I understand it, 

is -- is that if you have a maritime insurance 

case, you undertake the inquiry that it 

requires, and -- and if there's no -- if -- if 

there's no judicially established federal 

maritime insurance rule and there's no desire to 

create one, then -- then state law applies. 

And -- and so, so much of the argument 

here today is, is there a judicially established 

federal maritime insurance law?  And --

this Court, but in the industry?

 So my understanding is Wilburn Boat 

was something of a dislocating decision in the

 industry, and the -- the response to it, picking

 up on Justice Reed's dissent and Justice

 Frankfurter's concurrence, by the industry was,

 okay, well, we'll use choice-of-law provisions

 because, otherwise, there would be all this 

uncertainty created by -- by Wilburn Boat.  And 

choice-of-law provisions started to become 

commonplace. 

You can dispute any of this, 

obviously. 

And then choice-of-law provisions, 

particularly following The Bremen, became 

accepted as a matter of federal law by federal 

courts and that the -- this would be kind of 

Wilburn Boat redux if we go back now and say, 

oh, no, that whole experiment for the last 

couple generations of choice-of-law provisions 

is no good. 

You want to respond to that?

most important step.

 The issue is whether there's a

 presumption of enforceability of a

 conflict-of-law choice, not about whether

 there's a presumption of enforceability of a 

particular terms or substantive terms in a

 contract, but the simple question is: Is there 

a presumption of enforceability in a

 choice-of-law provision? 

And you seem to say, because we, the 

Supreme Court, hasn't said it, there can't be. 

But, obviously, Bremen put that to rest because 

Bremen found one, whether there had been one 

before or not, it announced that it had 

preexisted itself. 

I'm still not sure you made that 

presumption below. The Third Circuit seemed to 

have made it.  Every lower court who's faced the 

question has presumed that there's that 

presumption. 

You haven't given me a reason why in 

admiralty law there wouldn't be that 

presumption.  We want uniform -- uniformity in 

maritime interpretation.  We want people to be 

secure in knowing which laws are going to apply,

 And -- and once you get to that stage,

 then -- then you're in the state -- state law

 world under Wilburn Boat.  And -- and the other

 side is saying, well, only strong federal public 

policy can overcome that. And let me explain

 where that rule comes from.

 The case they cited the most in their

 cert petition and continue to rely upon in their 

merits briefing is a case from the Fifth Circuit 

called Stoot, and -- and that case, it -- it --

I -- I suggest looking at it if you haven't 

already -- is a non-maritime insurance case 

involving a dispute between the owner of an oil 

rig and the catering company on the oil rig, and 

they have a contract that decided to select 

Louisiana law on the issue of indemnification. 

Under regular -- federal maritime law, 

an indemnification provision in a contract would 

be enforceable.  But, under Louisiana law, a 

what's called, I believe, the 

anti-indemnification oil field statute of 

Louisiana, you cannot enforce an indemnification 

provision in -- in a case governed by that 

Louisiana law.

And so the issue before the Fifth 

Circuit in Stoot was could the parties replace

 substantive federal admiralty law allowing an

 indemnification claim with a law of Louisiana

 disallowing an indemnification claim.  And the

 Fifth Circuit said we have to look at -- at 

federal public policy to decide whether we'll

 allow state law to displace federal law.

 I know it's a strange scenario 

because, in -- in many situations, federal law 

necessarily is -- is deemed to be controlling in 

the absence -- even -- even if there is 

conflicting state law, but the Fifth Circuit 

said there's not a strong federal policy, so 

we'll allow the parties to choose the law.  And

know, thinking about Justice Sotomayor's

JUSTICE JACKSON: No, no, no, I'm just

 talking about as a matter of theory.  Like, as

 a -- so setting aside what -- what Wilburn Boat 

-- I'm just trying to understand one reason why 

it would be that the federal exception -- you'd 

have to have federal interests in the exception 

is a couple, one is that we have a general rule 

and we have an exception and unless you actually 

have sort of the same dynamic working, you could 

easily see how the exception could swallow the 

rule. You'd never have the rule, right, because 

the exception is sort of being established on a 

different plane.  So that's one thing. 

Another thing is, to the extent we're 

talking about federal interests overarching this 

entire dynamic, we know, as Justice Sotomayor 

says, the federal interests are in uniformity 

and predictability and all of those sorts of 

things. 

So, if we have a single federal 

spokesperson regarding what is accepted, you're 

more likely to advance the interest of 

uniformity and predictability, whereas if you 

have state interests operating in the exception,

you're going to have all of these different

 exceptions popping up at different times and 

people aren't going to know what they're doing.

 So I appreciate that there's a world

 in which insurance contracts are different and

 they're ordinarily run by the states and each

 state has a particular interest, consumer 

protection, not, or whatever, but if our entire 

kind of framing is about ensuring predictability 

and uniformity, why would we have a world in 

which we would allow different state policy 

interests to be driving the exception in this 

way? 

MR. BASHMAN: Well, I have multiple 

points to make in response to that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Sorry, that was a 

long question. 

MR. BASHMAN: Sure.  First of all, 

that -- that's -- Wilburn Boat weighed the --

the federal interest in uniformity and said that 

in the maritime insurance area, it did not 

outweigh state regulation, which is obviously 

what this case involves, as -- as was alluded to

that's -- the Great Lakes argues in favor of is 

-- is not the sort of uniformity that this Court 

ordinarily speaks of in -- in the maritime --

the general maritime law context, where it's

 essentially a substantive rule.  So, as -- as 

was alluded to earlier, under the Dutra Group

 case, you can't get punitive damages on an

 unseaworthiness claim. 

This -- this case still allows any 

maritime insurer to pick whatever choice of law 

to apply -- choice of state law to apply in the 

absence of federal law.  And -- and, again, that 

-- I -- there's no other -- in -- in no other 

area of the law is there a choice-of-law 

principle that says, yes, state law controls, 

but the only thing relevant in deciding whether 

the court should enforce that or not is federal 

law. 

This -- this Court, when it decides 

admiralty cases, takes a look at the law that 

exists out -- outside -- out in the real world 

and -- and tries to figure out, you know, what 

-- what is a sensible rule of law to apply in 

this case?  And what I'm telling you is -- is 

the rule of law that the other side is seeking

area you just don't see anywhere.

 And I think that's one of the reasons 

why the two leading choice-of-law law 

professors, even though they filed an amicus

 brief at -- at the same time as the other side's 

amicus brief in support of neither party, came 

out essentially the same way that we're urging 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, they did 

that -- the Coyle and Roosevelt brief, is that 

what you're talking about?  They did that as a 

matter of federal common law.  So they rejected 

your premises that -- and they concluded, if --

assuming there's a federal presumption of 

enforceability and that the exceptions are 

determined by federal common law, they -- they 

disagree with you on that. 

But then I want to ask you about that. 

Then they adopt -- they say we should adopt the 

Restatement as the federal exceptions.  And the 

second one of the Restatement, the second 

provision, talks about the competing state 

interests in the -- in the matter. 

And the other side says don't do that

because that Restatement provision was designed 

for interstate disputes, and this is maritime.

 To me, if we get to this, this will be

 really important, what we say about this, so I 

want to give you a chance to respond to that.

 MR. BASHMAN: Right.  I -- I think 

that's the reason that the law professors are

 correct that that Restatement section should be 

applied here, which, of course, is an argument 

that we also put forth in our brief --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah, I agree with 

you, it was a backup backup argument's there. 

MR. BASHMAN: Right. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So, yeah. 

MR. BASHMAN: Is -- is that this case 

arises in the setting of -- of a conflict 

between the law of -- of two states.  And that's 

what I referred to earlier as the horizontal 

choice-of-law conflict. 

The other side is trying to turn it 

into a vertical choice-of-law conflict.  But --

but, if there was some federal policy that 

mattered, we don't dispute that that federal 

policy would control.  That -- that's what 

Wilburn Boat says.

But -- but, again, the other side is

the maritime insurance context that say that 

ordinarily we will enforce a choice-of-law 

provision. Again, a showing of a smattering of 

federal appellate court decisions that Wilburn 

-- Wilburn Boat says is not enough to judicially

 establish it to begin with.  And -- and they say

 let's use that as the main federal rule, and 

let's apply it to insurance cases too. 

Again, if -- if Wilburn Boat were so 

easy to evade, you know, it might make you 

wonder what -- what's the point of even having 

it. But -- but, of course, the other side did 

not make that their issue --

cared about it, we would have a rule, are you

your brief and today that you're talking about 

the utmost good faith issue, which is different.

 MR. BASHMAN: So this case -- we --

we've been arguing this case for quite a little 

bit now. This case involves whether my client 

can maintain certain counterclaims under

 Pennsylvania law, and -- and so those are 

Pennsylvania law statutory counterclaims.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, but let me 

just say it differently.  I understood the 

utmost good faith to -- to bear on whether you 

could maintain those claims.  But putting that 

aside, I guess what I'm saying is, what federal 

policy are you talking about when you say 

federal law doesn't care?  Are you talking about 

the substance of your claims, that their -- your 

counterclaims, or are you talking about the 

choice of law? 

MR. BASHMAN: I'm -- I -- I guess, to 

answer that directly, what -- what the other 

side's position is, is that there's generally no 

federal policy that would support overcoming a 

choice-of-law provision in the maritime 

insurance context.  And, again, I'd lay that at 

the feet of Wilburn Boat, which said we're not

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Just one thing. 

When you say federal maritime law doesn't care, 

federal law doesn't care about the choice of 

law, I mean, I think federal maritime law, as

 reflected in decisions of this Court, does care 

about predictability and certainty. 

And if that's true, then that doesn't 

defeat your argument on this point, but I think 

it's in tension with your argument that as a 

matter of federal common law, we should weigh 

each state's competing interest in the matter.

I thought your point was that federal law is

 MR. BASHMAN: Right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON: Which is why we go 

in the contract to New York, because that's

 their opening paragraph.  If federal law doesn't 

care about this, then you make it New York.

 MR. BASHMAN:  Right.  We have --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But then -- but then 

we have federal law caring about the fact that 

you've made that contractual provision and 

saying you have to enforce, unless, et cetera, 

et cetera.  So why isn't that the federal policy 

that is sort of driving this? 

MR. BASHMAN: So -- so, to answer the 

-- the first part of your question, we -- we 

have the adoption of the Restatement as our 

fallback argument under what I'll refer to as 

step 2 of Wilburn Boat, which is, if -- if this 

Court sees a need to announce a uniform federal 

rule, Wilburn Boat made clear that ordinarily 

that would not be done but, rather, that it 

should be left to -- to Congress. 

And -- and I can't say it enough. You 

know, Congress is across the street and has 

plenary power to overturn Wilburn Boat, and 70

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WALL: Just a handful of points.

question, the boat is available for sale online 

if you have a half million dollars. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WALL: And as best I can tell from 

the pictures, the engines were salvaged.  So --

so don't worry. 

Justice Barrett, at page 12 of the Op, 

they recite the well-established maritime 

principle that these choice-of-law clauses are 

generally valid unless unreasonable or unjust. 

And then it's all a debate at the cert stage, as 

it was in the lower courts, about when the sort 

of general validity or presumption can be 

overcome.

the case. I think, you know, we can go back and 

forth on the quotes from the brief. I feel good

 about them, but I think, reading the briefs in 

context, that was never at issue in the case as

 it -- and the Court did not grant the broader

 first QP in the petition.  It only granted the

 narrower second QP on how to work the except --

 exception. 

If the Court agrees that there is a 

presumption, set aside, Justice Kagan, Bremen 

and Wilburn Boat. And if you were just asking, 

well, how would it work, if you had no 

choice-of-law clause in the contract, you'd 

apply federal choice-of-law rules.  That's this 

Court's decision in Lauritzen, all federal. 

It's not diversity, it's not Klaxon, you don't 

look to state law.  There's a federal 

choice-of-law test in admiralty. 

All right. We put the choice-of-law 

clause in the contract, what now?  We have a 

presumption. Well, it wouldn't be much of a 

presumption if federal law goes if 50 states 

could just set it aside.  That's Justice 

Jackson's point.

case, it seems to have a fairly international

 flavor.  You have a German insurer.  You have an

 insured in Pennsylvania that designates an agent 

in the contract in Florida, and the boat can 

travel up and down the Eastern Seaboard and the

 Bahamas, nowhere else. That's the navigational

 limit.

 That sure triggers some interests of

 Pennsylvania, but it doesn't seem like the only 

state in play, and more importantly, it seems 

like the sort of national and international 

thing that triggers the broader purposes of 

maritime. 

But even if you didn't buy all of 

that, we do have The Bremen.  The best reading 

of The Bremen is that public policy is federal 

public policy, not state public policy. 

Mr. Bashman agrees that forum-

selection clauses are even more pernicious.  If 

that's right, then having adopted the rule with 

respect to The Bremen, it seems to me easier on 

the choice-of-law side to say you should have 

exactly the same rule. 

Then the move is, but it's an 

insurance case.  But we don't do that for forum-

 selection clauses.  We don't have The Bremen 

test for all maritime contracts that aren't

 marine insurance.  Every bill of lading, every 

towage contract, every employment contract, we 

have The Bremen test across the board, so why 

would we distinguish on the choice-of-law side 

and have The Bremen test for non-insurance 

maritime contracts but The Bremen looking to 

state policy for marine insurance contracts? 

I think all of that should make the 

Court skeptical of Wilburn Boat, but even if you 

don't approach it through the lens of Kossick 

and Kirby and Dutra, you could simply say, we 

cleared the high bar in Wilburn Boat and Bremen 

and for exactly the same reasons, we clear it 

again here, because there is a tradeoff in this 

contract. 

It has a forum-selection clause that 

is a favorable forum for the plaintiffs.  They 

get to sue in Pennsylvania.  It picks out a 

neutral law, a German company picked the U.S. 

state to which it had the most ties, where it 

has its American trust accounts, where it's 

designated as a -- a surplus lines insurer, and 

where it has its agent for service of process.

It picked a stable, well-developed 

body of both commercial and maritime law, the 

state where it has the most substantial 

connections which ex ante we should not think

 would be unfair to the policyholder at all.

 Why not treat those clauses as a

 package?  They should be generally enforceable 

as a matter of federal law unless they offend

 federal public policy. 

They don't here, Justice Kavanaugh. 

There's no argument that they do.  So, although 

I tried to articulate the limits earlier, I 

don't think the Court needs to -- to get into 

them or to catalogue them here.  All you have to 

say is that for the same reasons as The Bremen, 

it serves federal interests in maritime. 

It gives you uniformity so that you 

know that your clause will be enforced without 

having to try to figure out 50 states' laws.  It 

allows the insured a price in a predictable way 

which lowers the premium for the insured. 

That's not just speculation.  You look 

at the policy here.  It's a pretty reasonable 

premium for what is a pretty substantial policy, 

but it comes with limits, limits that they
