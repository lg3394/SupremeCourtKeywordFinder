 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-1078, Warner Chappell

 Music versus Nealy.

 Mr. Shanmugam.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

This case presents the question 

whether a copyright plaintiff can recover 

damages for acts that allegedly occurred more 

than three years before the filing of suit. 

As a straightforward matter of 

statutory interpretation, the answer to that 

question here is no. Under the applicable 

statute of limitations, a civil action must be 

brought within three years after the claim 

accrued.  A claim accrues when the plaintiff has 

a complete cause of action. 

Accordingly, as this Court repeatedly 

stated in Petrella, a plaintiff can obtain 

damages for acts of infringement only within 

three years of filing.  And under this Court's

understanding of the background discovery rule, 

a plaintiff is entitled to extend that period

 only in cases involving fraud.

 Now faced with those points, 

Respondents seek to use the rephrased question 

presented to clear the board of Petitioners'

 strongest arguments.  But that question directs 

the parties to address the statute, and

 statutory construction begins with the text. 

Respondents eventually join issue on 

the text, but the inferences from the other 

provisions they cite cannot overcome the plain 

meaning of the term "accrues." And even if the 

statutory text were somehow off the table here, 

Respondents offer no valid explanation for this 

Court's statements in Petrella, and they assume 

the existence of a broad discovery rule, even in 

the face of disagreement among the lower courts 

about the discovery rule's scope.  And 

Respondents do not dispute that if the discovery 

rule applies only in cases involving fraud, they 

are not entitled to invoke it. 

There is no precedent for this Court's 

resolving a question of statutory interpretation 

by assuming away the relevant statutory text.

At most, the rephrased question presented 

assumes the existence of some version of the

 discovery rule.  It does not take sides on the

 scope of that rule.

 Nor need the Court establish the exact

 contours of the discovery rule here.  Instead, 

it need only hold that Respondents in this case 

are not entitled to damages for acts that took

 place more than a decade before they filed suit. 

And on that basis, this Court should reverse the 

court of appeals' judgment. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Did the courts, any 

of the courts below, rule on or pass on the 

discovery rule, or did it -- they just simply 

assume the existence of some discovery rule? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So I think that the 

court of appeals reaffirmed its prior discovery 

rule from the Webster decision, which applies 

parenthetically only in the context of ownership 

disputes. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So the argument that 

you're making now, was it raised below? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So we did not raise 

that argument in the Eleventh Circuit precisely

 because we were bound by the Webster decision.

 But we would respectfully submit that that is 

not necessary, both because the Eleventh Circuit

 passed upon the issue and because there has

 never been a requirement that a party challenge 

binding court of appeals case law as a ticket to

 raise arguments before this Court.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  What was the question

 that was certified to the Eleventh Circuit? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So the question that 

was certified was the question of the 

availability of retrospective relief for acts 

beyond three years from the time of the filings. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But didn't it assume 

the existence of the -- of the discovery rule? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Precisely because, in 

the Eleventh Circuit, there was binding case law 

on that issue.  And our fundamental submission 

for this Court is that we are not challenging 

the existence of a discovery rule. 

To be sure, the question of the scope 

of any discovery rule is to some extent 

intertwined with the substantive question that 

is presented here.  And to quote from this 

Court's question presented, that question is

"whether a copyright plaintiff can recover

 lawsuit."

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Shanmugam, we 

took it off the table, and your cert petition 

did not ask us to grant cert on the merits of

 the discovery rule.  In fact, your cert petition 

acknowledged that there was no split on the 

discovery rule and that the split was between 

the Second and the Ninth on this recovery of 

damages beyond three years' point. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I would 

respectfully disagree with that, Justice 

Barrett, to this extent:  In the star footnote 

in our petition, we indicated that the Court may 

wish --

JUSTICE BARRETT: But it wasn't the 

question on which you sought cert.  And your 

brief pretty much says, well, this is our 

strongest point, so this is what we're going to 

focus on. The star footnote was not what you 

asked us to grant cert on. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, we asked this 

Court to grant cert on a somewhat broader

 question presented.  The formulation of our

 question presented, as we indicated in the star

 footnote, would have given the Court the 

opportunity to pass on the antecedent question 

of whether or not the Copyright Act embodies a

 discovery rule.

 Once this Court rephrased the question 

presented, we abandoned any argument that there

 is no discovery rule.  My point to this Court is 

simply that the scope of the discovery rule is 

relevant to this question.  Why is --

JUSTICE JACKSON: But how so, Mr. 

Shanmugam?  When we rephrased the question, we 

rephrased it.  And I noted that you didn't read 

the part, when -- when you talked about what the 

question presented is, whether under the 

discovery rule applied by the circuit courts and 

the Copyright Act's statute of limitation for 

civil actions.  We were very specific.  We 

weren't saying, you know, please entertain some 

arguments about the scope of the rule.  We were 

taking it off the table, as Justice Barrett 

suggests. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Yeah, happy to address 

that, and I certainly didn't mean to ignore the

 prepositional phrase at the beginning.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  The critical -- the

 critical part.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well -- well, let me

 address that directly.  So I think that what

 that part of the question presented did was to

 direct the parties to address the substantive

 question, the availability of retrospective 

relief, in light of two considerations, as you 

say, first, the discovery accrual rule applied 

by the circuit courts and, second, the statute 

of limitations itself. 

Now our submission, as the Court will 

be aware, as to the first part of that is that 

there is no consensus in the courts of appeals 

about the scope of the discovery rule.  There is 

consensus about the existence of a discovery 

rule. On that issue, all of the regional 

circuits have said to some extent that there is 

a discovery rule.  We read this Court's 

rephrasing of the question presented to take 

that issue off the table precisely because there 

was no circuit conflict on that issue. 

But the Court also addressed --

directed us to address the statutory text.  And

our submission, to the extent that Respondents

 and the government suggest that, well, you 

should just look at the arguments in the court

 of appeals' decisions addressing the circuit 

conflict, is that when you look at those 

decisions, they in turn address this Court's 

decision in Petrella, they cite the language on

 which we rely from Petrella, and our submission 

to this Court is that that language, in turn, 

relied on the statute of limitations.  It relied 

on Section 507(b).  When the Court said on 

multiple occasions that retrospective relief was 

not available for acts beyond three years, the 

Court was discussing Section 507(b). 

So I think it would be quite 

artificial for this Court to try to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, isn't it 

artificial for you to do what Justice Barrett 

said, which is to raise the most important part 

of your argument in a footnote to say the Court 

can reach it if it wants? 

The Court chose not to.  Your 

petition -- you point to Samia, where the Court 

did reach a question that wasn't argued below. 

It's a very good example. And that petition was

the Court to answer the question that it had not 

raised below because of binding circuit

 precedent.

 You didn't do that.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You came in and 

said reach this other question, not the one

 that's most important, not the one I'm going to 

hinge my argument on in my brief.  Don't reach 

that because there's no circuit split, you don't 

have to.  We're just going to rely on the 

discovery rule argument. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So I have two points 

in response to that. The first is that, again, 

in the cert petition, I think we were quite 

forthright in indicating that we would raise the 

issue on which we were bound below, the issue of 

whether or not the Copyright Act embodied a 

discovery rule at all. When the Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, counsel.  You 

put that in a footnote, that there was no 

circuit split around it.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- but I'm happy to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- can I move on 

to another issue? Show me the statutory

 language that you reply on.

 The damages section speaks about

 damages.  The statute of limitations speaks

 about a time period to file a complaint.  You're

 automatically tying the two.  Tell me how you're 

doing it. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure, I'd be glad to. 

And that is precisely why --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Statutorily how. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  And that's 

precisely why in our brief we start with the 

statutory language.  After all, this is a 

question of statutory interpretation. 

We believe that the relevant language 

is the language in Section 507(b), as this Court 

directed in the rephrased question presented, 

and not the language in 504 or any other 

provision.  We would freely recognize that in 

the remedial provision, there is no sort of 

limitations period built into that.

Section 507(b) and, of course, in particular, 

the operative term "accrues" is the relevant

 language.

 Now I will say that this Court's

 decision in Petrella, which I think my friends 

on the other side acknowledge is well within the

 scope of the question presented, because, after

 all, that was the primary authority discussed by 

the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit and the 

Eleventh Circuit, when this Court said time and 

again that there was a limitation on 

retrospective relief, the Court cited the 

statute of limitations in Section 507(b). 

Now, to be sure, the Court in its 

opinion in Footnote 4 recognized that some 

courts of appeals had recognized a discovery 

rule. 

We think that those two things can be 

harmonized by concluding that when the Court 

referred to the discovery rule there, what it 

was really referring to is the more modest 

equity-based discovery rule that this Court has 

recognized, most recently in Gabelli and 

Rotkiske, a discovery rule -- rule that is 

limited to cases involving fraud and not a

 But it is really for that reason that

 treatises like --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that --

that -- that's the -- the scope of when the

 exception can be raised is different from

 whether it can or not.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it is a statute 

of limitations as you claim that does not permit 

recovery at all if it's outside the three-year 

period, then there would be no fraud exception. 

It would be almost like a statute of repose. 

But that's not the argument you're 

making.  You're making a very different one that 

would be subject to briefing in the appropriate 

case of how -- why the expansive was the 

discovery -- was the fraud exception in the 

common law.  But there is an exception of some 

sort that you're recognizing.  The only question 

is its breadth. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Correct.  And on that 

issue --

we granted cert on.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  But, to circle back to 

Justice Jackson's question about the rephrased

 question presented, I don't think that this

 Court when it rephrased the question presented 

-- and you can certainly tell me if I'm

 incorrect about this -- was accepting any

 particular version of the discovery rule.

 And there is disagreement about that

 in the courts of appeals. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The only 

disagreement is whether it applies to ownership 

versus infringement.  There is no disagreement 

on the issue of whether, if it applies, how 

limited is it. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  It --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And does that matter 

that you're an ownership case versus an 

infringement case?  Does that matter to your 

argument here at all, that -- that disagreement 

about the discovery rule? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, as this case 

comes to the Court, the Eleventh Circuit does 

apply the discovery rule to ownership claims. 

Our point is simply that in the courts of 

appeals, there are a variety of views about the

 discovery rule in any notion of accrual.  It 

instead locates it in a notion of equitable

 tolling.

 And my submission to this Court -- and 

this goes to one of our other arguments that, 

again, I think is properly before the Court --

is that in rephrasing the question presented, I 

don't think that the Court is bound to any of 

the options the courts of appeals have 

previously accepted, particularly when those 

decisions are inconsistent with this Court's 

approach to the discovery rule more generally.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I just --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, I'm sorry. 

Finish. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  No, go ahead.

hold that there -- there is no discovery rule 

with respect to the statute of limitations and

we granted review would go away, would it not?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  The answer to 

that question would be no, with a proviso that

 the Court could and I think should leave open 

the question of whether or not there is a

 narrower equity-based discovery rule for cases 

involving fraud. And the Court does not need to 

opine on that here for the reason that I gave in 

the opening, namely, that there's no claim here. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me map out 

what would happen if, in the event -- and this 

may or may not occur -- we granted cert in the 

case, we were to dismiss this petition as 

improvidently granted.  The case, I assume, 

would go back to the district court, and the 

district court would be aware that we recently 

-- excuse me -- granted review in a case that 

does present the issue of whether there is a 

discovery rule for the Copyright Act statute of 

limitations. 

So, if I were the district court judge 

in those circumstances, I might choose not to 

plow ahead with further proceedings in this case 

until that issue was resolved. 

Isn't that true?

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  Well, I think, 

that the court would be bound by the existing

 Eleventh Circuit case law. But let me just say 

a word about this question of whether or not to 

dismiss the case, because I don't think that

 this is a case involving, you know, unfair

 surprise or anything like that.  We flagged this

 issue again in the petition.

 It's really a dispute about what 

arguments are available to us and what arguments 

the Court should address concerning the question 

presented because, after all, as you pointed 

out, if our view of the statutory language is 

correct, the answer to the question presented 

will be no. 

Now we have a number of arguments 

before this Court --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what -- what 

concerns me is that we're being asked to decide 

what -- a -- a question that may be eliminated 

based on a subsequent decision.  I mean, we're

Is there a discovery rule?  If there 

is, what is -- what are its implications for 

relief?  The first is logically prior to the

 second.  Why does it make sense to talk about 

the second without resolving the first?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, it -- it 

doesn't, but I think what I would say is that 

it's really critical, as is always true in a 

case of statutory interpretation, to start with 

the relevant statutory language, and that is

 precisely why, when the Court rephrased the 

question presented, we pivoted away from any 

threshold argument that there's no discovery 

rule and we said let's start with the statutory 

language, as this Court directed, and figure out 

how it bears on this question of the 

availability of retrospective relief.  Now --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what is your 

argument on that, please? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Sure.  Our argument is 

very simple, and I think that the issue is 

abundantly joined in the briefing in this case. 

It is, what is the meaning of the term 

"accrues"?  Our submission is simple.  As this 

Court has said, the standard rule is that 

"accrues" means at the point when you have a 

complete and present cause of action. 

Now that's not a hard-and-fast rule.

That can be rebutted by context or other cues. 

But, here, the statutes that Respondents and

 their amici cite simply don't rebut that

 ordinary presumption.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I guess what I 

don't understand is why that has to do with the

 scope of the damages.  So we have "accrues" and 

we have "accrues" in Section 507, which talks 

about when a civil action shall be maintained. 

So fine, right?  Even if I agree with 

you that "accrues" means what you say it means, 

that just -- the consequence of that, it looks 

like, under this statute is that the action 

shall be maintained within that time frame. 

You -- you seem to be arguing that if 

you maintain an action within that time frame, 

the three-year statute of limitations that 

pertains to 507 is somehow transported into the 

consideration of how much damages you can get. 

And so that's the part where you've lost me. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Happy to address that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes.

occurred more than three years before the filing

 of a lawsuit. 

And if you go back and look at this 

Court's decision in Petrella, I think that that 

was the distinction that the Court was drawing. 

I think the Court was saying, if the act takes

 place more than three years before, you cannot

 get retrospective relief.

 And, as we explain in our brief, 

prospective relief is different for the simple 

reason that you don't have to have any past 

violation at all in order to get injunctive 

relief.  All you have to show is a likelihood of 

future infringement. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: But what do we do 

with 504 and the discussion of being entitled to 

recover the actual damages suffered by him? So, 

if you have an act that occurs within the time 

frame, but the damages extend before that, I 

take it your position is you can't go back any 

more than three years, but I don't see that in 

the statute.

consistent with Petrella and I think the Second 

Circuit's reasoning in Sohm, is that it's

actually the timing of the act. In other words, 

in the perhaps unlikely scenario that you had an

 act that took place four or five years earlier,

 we're not saying there's a damages cutoff at

 three years.  And I don't think that that's what 

Justice Ginsburg in her opinion for the Court

 was saying either.

 Now I recognize that that feels like 

the flip side of the broad version of the 

discovery rule, and I would submit to the Court 

that it is. That is why these issues are so 

hard conceptually to disentangle. 

My point is simply that when it comes 

to retrospective relief, if the act took place 

more than three years earlier, the implication 

of the statutory language is you are out of 

luck. You cannot recover for retrospective 

relief.  If you're bringing a claim for 

prospective relief, it will turn on whether 

there is a likelihood of future infringement. 

Now I want to say a word about 

Petrella and our other arguments before this 

Court because, as I was saying to Justice Alito,

 involving what issues the Court should address, 

is because we have three other arguments.

 The first is our argument concerning

 Petrella, and I've already addressed that to

 some extent.  I think the only other thing I

 would add is that I don't think that

 Respondents' or the government's 

characterization of Petrella is credible.

 They say that when the Court on 

multiple occasions was talking about the 

availability of retrospective relief, the Court 

was really talking about Ms. Petrella's case, 

and because she was not relying on a discovery 

rule, that those statements should all be read 

in that context. 

But the Court was relying on the 

unavailability of retrospective relief for acts 

more than three years earlier precisely to 

explain why applying the doctrine of laches was 

unnecessary because there was a strict statutory 

cutoff. 

And that is why the leading treatises 

have said that the logic of Petrella supports 

our position here.  It supports our position 

because that was a necessary premise of the

some penumbra of Section 504 or something else.

 Now the two other arguments that we

 are making to this Court are, first, the

 argument that under a proper understanding of 

the discovery rule, it should be limited to 

fraud. 

When you look out over the court of 

appeals' opinions that have adopted the 

discovery rule, there is not a lot of reasoning 

in those opinions.  They really rely on two 

things:  first, the broad-based presumption in 

favor of a discovery rule that this Court cast 

doubt on -- on -- in TRW and then repudiated in 

Rotkiske and, second, the fact that the criminal 

statute of limitations uses "arises" rather than 

"accrues." 

And as recently as yesterday, members 

of the Court indicated that there's no 

meaningful difference between those two terms. 

The Court itself recognized as much in Petrella

 itself.  And the legislative history indicates 

that Congress intended for those two periods to

 be similar.

 And our last argument before the 

Court, again, an argument that is plainly within 

the scope of the question presented even if you

 take the stingiest view of it, is the argument 

that, at a minimum, if the Court thinks that 

there is a broad discovery rule, it should 

characterize that as an equitable rule that is 

subject to equitable limitations. 

And, at a minimum, we think that this 

Court's statements in Petrella, if the Court 

doesn't agree with us on the interpretation of 

the statute, should be applied as an equitable 

limitation on that equitable rule.  Indeed, in 

Petrella itself, the Court recognized that the 

doctrine of laches could apply where what you're 

dealing with is an equitable principle or a 

source of equitable relief. 

So, at bottom, what is really going on 

here, I would submit -- and I recognize that it 

is difficult to sort of parse questions 

presented sometimes.  We spent a lot of time 

trying to figure out exactly what the Court was

intending when it reframed the question 

presented in a way that directed us both to the 

text and to what the lower courts had done.

 Our fundamental submission is it would 

-- it would be wholly artificial for the Court 

to try to resolve this case without starting

 with the relevant statutory language.  It would 

be a straw man for the Court to say: Well, 

there's no limitation in Section 504 or Section 

502. And that is precisely because we are 

dealing with a three-year limitations period 

that is in Section 507(b). 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  May -- may I ask a 

question about your last submission?  It seems 

to me a pretty tough one.  Kind of a halfway 

textualism, if you will, to -- to say that 

there's a discovery rule, put aside fraud, a 

real discovery rule, the real bad wine, okay, 

but we're only going to do three years because 

Petrella, which interpreted the statute, which 

you think doesn't have a discovery rule?  I 

mean, that -- that's a -- that's a bit of a -- a 

few gymnastics required there. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So I -- I don't think 

that that's quite what we're saying, Justice

concerning the text, again, our argument is a

 claim accrues when you have a complete and

 present cause of action.  None of these --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I totally understand

 that argument.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  None of these other 

statutes overcomes that. So, therefore, what is

 the consequence? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I got all 

that. I'm asking about your last argument and 

only your last argument. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Sure.  So our last 

argument is the equitable limitation. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Yes. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  And I recognize that 

you only get to that as a fallback if you reject 

our statutory argument or if you somehow say 

that that is off the table.  And I would submit 

that the Court really shouldn't --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, no, nobody --

nobody's going to say it's off the table, all

 aware, counsel.

assuming that we are not going to decide 507 and 

you've got Petrella out there, how do you -- how 

do you get to this, okay, there's a discovery 

rule, but it's only a three-year discovery rule? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  The best reading of 

Petrella is that Petrella was in turn resting on 

507(b). 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  We are not arguing for 

a -- a three-year discovery rule. We're arguing 

for a three-year injury rule. We think that the 

trigger is the point of injury.

-- it's not even the old bad wine. It's

 something else.  It's a new bad wine.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think that the

 discovery rule, as applied by the lower courts, 

allows you to go back for acts that have taken

 place more than three years earlier.  As we

 point out in this case, we're talking about acts

 of infringement going back to 2008.

 And -- and we would submit that a 

proper understanding of the discovery rule is to 

limit it to cases of fraud.  So the way that 

this legal regime should work, if the Court 

feels unencumbered by the exact parsing of the 

question presented, is acts of infringement more 

than three years earlier, ordinarily not 

actionable.  Under the ordinary operation of the 

discovery rule, they are actionable if you have 

fraud or concealment or one of the other 

traditionally recognized equity-based 

exceptions. 

This is not a difficult question.  The 

Court has before it all of the arguments to 

resolve the question of the correct 

interpretation of Section 507(b), and we would 

submit that the Court can proceed to do that

timely under the discovery rule, Respondents are 

entitled to seek damages as a remedy for those

 claims.  Section 507(b) makes no distinction 

between claims seeking the remedy of damages and

 claims seeking other forms of relief.  Section

 504 is entitled "Remedies for Infringement, 

Damages, and Profits," and it expressly says 

that a copyright owner is entitled to recover 

the actual damages suffered by him, any profits 

of the infringer, or statutory damages for all 

infringements involved in the action.  There is 

no damages bar for copyright claims in Title 17. 

Now Congress has enacted three-year 

lookback damages bars as narrow exceptions 

elsewhere in Title 17, but Congress needed to 

add those as narrow exceptions precisely because 

there is no damages bar in Title 17 as a general 

rule. 

Nor would a judicially created damages 

bar be permissible.  In Petrella, this Court 

held that if a copyright claim is timely under 

the statute of limitations, again, as is assumed 

here, courts are not at liberty to impose 

equitable-based time limits on the recovery of 

damages for those claims.

Now, to be sure, in Petrella, recovery 

was limited to infringements committed during 

the three years before the complaint was filed. 

But that was because, under a laches case like 

that one and any other laches case, earlier 

claims which separately accrue were and will

 become time-barred under the statute of

 limitations when the plaintiff doesn't sue on

 them. 

That is how the statute of limitations 

takes account of delay.  It bars claims if 

they're not brought within three years of when 

they accrue.  But, if a copyright claim is 

brought within three years of when it accrues 

and, thus, is timely under the statute of 

limitations, damages must be available as a 

remedy. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Petitioner seems to 

argue that, well, I'm willing to assume a 

discovery rule, but it's a very narrow or 

cramped discovery rule. 

If we're going to assume the existence 

of a discovery rule, how do we determine its 

scope?

MR. EARNHARDT:  Well, I think the 

question presented answers that question as

 well. The way that I interpret the question

 presented -- and I don't think it's very

 complicated -- is that Clause 1 of the question 

presented defines a term nested within Clause 2.

 So Clause 2 refers to Section 507(b).

 507(b) uses the word "accrue," okay?  What rule

 determines when a claim accrues?  Well, Clause 1 

of the question presented tells us what the 

assumption is here, which is the discovery 

accrual rule applied by the circuit courts tells 

you when a claim accrues. And so the reason a 

fraud-based discovery rule doesn't work is 

that's not the discovery accrual rule applied by 

the circuit courts. 

Another piece of potential confusion 

that I think I should clear up is we -- we agree 

that what the scope of the discovery rule is is 

not necessary to answer the question presented. 

You hold that constant and say does the 

discovery rule apply and, if so, what are the 

consequences of damages.  But, even if that were 

relevant, there is no disagreement in the lower 

courts about the scope of the discovery rule

even with respect to ownership claims.

 So Petitioners say in their reply

 brief that in the -- in the Sixth, Ninth, and

 Tenth Circuits, the courts don't apply a 

discovery rule if it's a so-called ownership

 claim. I believe that's demonstrably false. 

Here is what the Abbas case from the Ninth 

Circuit, which they cite for that proposition, 

says about the discovery rule under an ownership 

claim: "Under these circumstances, a plaintiff 

must bring suit within three years of receiving 

notice of the repudiation of his or her 

ownership rights." 

That is a discovery rule.  It's a more 

permissive form of a discovery rule.  Inquiry 

notice is not enough.  It has to be actual 

notice.  And it has to be a particular type of 

actual notice and express repudiation.  All of 

those things can only delay the statute of 

limitations running, but it's a discovery rule. 

It turns on what the plaintiff knows, not on 

what the defendant did.  And so, for that 

reason, there is no variability in the lower 

courts about the scope of discovery rule if that 

were relevant.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Do you have a view 

on Justice Alito's suggestion about dismissing

 the case?

 MR. EARNHARDT:  You know, I think 

either path is viable. I will say that, you 

know, being from New York, the -- the Sohm court

 is -- is causing some mischief there and the 

decision of the Second Circuit in Sohm is so 

facially incorrect that I believe it would be 

helpful to the -- to the bar to -- to clarify 

that it's wrong, that there is no separate 

damages bar, and that would resolve the circuit 

split that currently exists between the Second 

Circuit on the one hand and the Ninth and the 

Eleventh on the other. 

I have to say, you know, we don't have 

sort of a dog in the hunt in this case about 

whether there is a discovery rule or not, but, 

for 40 years, the courts of appeals unanimously 

have found that there is one, and Congress 

during that time period has amended the 

Copyright Act 79 times, reasons big and small, 

and they've never stepped in to say that there's 

not one. 

In fact, when they've wanted there to

 This Court rephrased the question 

presented to exclude it, and so neither we nor

 the United States briefed it.  It's not 

necessary to decide the circuit split targeted 

by the actual question presented, which is, if

 not available as a remedy?  So I think this is a

MR. EARNHARDT: Well, so in the Second 

Circuit, under current law, even if a claim is 

timely, there's a peculiar rule that you can 

only seek damages going back for three years for 

that claim. 

And that is completely different from 

the rule that now exists in the Ninth Circuit

 What's the status of this rule now?

 MR. EARNHARDT:  It's more an issue of

 forum shopping.  Some folks want to be in the

 Second Circuit.  Other folks want to be in the

 Ninth and Eleventh Circuits.

 And so I think that it's an issue of 

-- the -- the -- the point of the Copyright Act,

 the reason that there was a statute of 

limitations enacted in the first place because 

there did not used to be one, you used to look 

at the state statute of limitations, was for 

there to be a uniform period during which 

time -- claims are timely and recovery is 

granted.  Now there's not. 

There's a circuit split in -- between 

the Second Circuit on the one hand and the Ninth 

and the Eleventh on the other about the 

availability of damages under the discovery 

rule. And that's a -- that's a -- an 

inconsistency that the Court, I think, 

importantly should resolve, and that's the --

the circuit split directed by the question 

presented.

the bad wine of recent vintage, that, as I 

understand the Court's critique of that, that's

 courts of appeals below assuming there's this

 background principle that there's a discovery 

rule when the word "accrue" is used, and that

 I -- I understand the Court has taken issue with

 in recent cases.

 That would not be the basis for the

 discovery rule here.  Here, the -- the --

Section 507(b) uses the word "accrue" and in 

Crown Coats, this Court was very careful to say 

that you cannot apply a universal meaning to the 

word "accrue."  You have to roll up your sleeves 

and look at what the Congress meant when it used 

that -- that word. 

So, if there's a discovery rule here 

in the Copyright Act, which we -- we submit that 

there is and that the question presented assumes 

there is, it's because, in 1957, when Congress 

adopted that term, they intended it to include a 

discovery rule.

the antecedent question of whether there's a

 mean, is there a split -- let's just -- let's

 just say that -- so we know there's a split on

 this other question about the scope of damages,

 right?

 And the antecedent question at least 

at the cert stage was kind of presented as, 

well, all the courts of appeals are applying 

this, but there is this division about the other 

thing.

us straight up, is there a discovery rule or is 

this an injury accrual, that that's the kind of 

thing the Court should take?

of the discovery rule, some saying ownership

 versus infringement.

 MR. EARNHARDT:  That's incorrect.

 That -- that is -- that is demonstrably

 incorrect.  The -- the cases that apply

 the owner -- the ownership claim distinction,

 which, by the way, is a -- is a -- is a 

questionable distinction in the first place, but

 the courts that do apply that distinction apply 

a discovery rule. 

It turns on when the plaintiff 

receives notice of an express repudiation. 

That's a more permissive form of a discovery 

rule. It can only delay the statute of 

limitations running, but it is a discovery rule. 

So you have a situation where, for 40 

years, the courts of appeals have uniformly 

applied a rule.  There's no contrary opinion in 

the courts of appeals that that is the rule. 

And Congress, this is not like the 

Sherman Act, where they -- they pass a -- an act 

with a few sentences and let the courts sort of 

figure it out. Congress has taken an active 

role in managing the copyright law of this 

country.  They've amended the Copyright Act 79

clause says 507(b).  507(b) says "accrue."  What 

rule should we use to determine when a claim

 accrues under the Copyright Act? Look to Clause

 Number 1. You use a discovery accrual rule 

applied by the circuit courts.

 So I think that's a -- that's a --

that's a clear -- a clear reading of the

 question presented.

 Just a -- a few -- just one comment on 

policy.  Congress gets to decide what the best 

policy is here. And in the Copyright Act, it 

balances repose on the one hand with 

compensation and motivation on the other. 

So the Copyright Act doesn't exist 

primarily to compensate authors whose works are 

being infringed.  It exists primarily to 

motivate other folks to create works based on 

the profit motive that's available to them. 

So, when Congress decides that policy, 

in certain circumstances, it has imposed a 

three-year lookback damages bar incompatible 

with a discovery rule for vessel hull design and 

other situations.  It hasn't done that with 

general copyright claims precisely because it 

wants to really motivate the -- the creation of

MR. EARNHARDT:  If the claim is 

timely, yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And that fits 

with Petrella because Petrella doesn't cover all 

cases; it covers some subset of cases.  Is that 

the gist of it? 

MR. EARNHARDT:  No. It's -- it's 

because that's the -- the precise holding of 

Petrella.  Petrella says that if a claim is 

timely under the statute of limitations -- in 

the discovery rule context, that would mean it 

is brought within three years of when the claim 

is or reasonably should have been discovered --

The -- the dissent in that case said 

this isn't fair. Ms. Petrella is getting a fair 

-- a free pass.  She sat on her hands and didn't

 sue. How can it be that she can bring claims 

and recover damages? The majority responds to 

that by saying no, no, no, many of

 Ms. Petrella's claims based on infringements

 that happened years ago accrued, the three-year 

period ran, and then those claims were 

time-barred, but it's the statute of limitations 

and the dismissal of claims that aren't brought 

within three years of when they accrue that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So Petrella only is 

with respect -- in your reading is Petrella is 

only with respect to claims in three years; it 

says nothing about the damages period.

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. DUBIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

First, the only question properly 

before the Court today is damages.  Read fairly, 

the reformulated question presented bakes in an 

assumption.  It tells the parties to assume that 

a copyright claim can accrue upon discovery, 

then ask whether damages are available if a 

claim is timely under that rule.

The answer to that question is a 

simple yes. If a claim is timely under 507(b), 

nothing in the Copyright Act imposes a separate

 time-based limit on damages. This Court's

 decision in Petrella rejected the idea that 

courts could impose an atextual bar on recovery 

for timely copyright claims, so the Second 

Circuit erred in relying on out-of-context

 language from Petrella to adopt a different 

atextual bar. 

Second, Petitioners don't much defend 

the Second Circuit -- Second Circuit's damages 

rule, perhaps because it lacks a textual basis. 

Instead, they're really asking the Court to 

answer a different question, whether the 

discovery accrual rule applies to copyright 

claims at all or at least to the claims here. 

But this Court reformulated the 

question presented to exclude that question, 

setting those arguments out of bounds.  If the 

Court reaches the merits, it should affirm the 

judgment below. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

 MS. DUBIN: The government does not 

have a view on whether there is a discovery rule 

at this time. We took our cues from the 

question presented as reformulated by the Court, 

and the question on which we solicited views

 across the government and provided our views is

 on the question of damages.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  That was just an 

unfair question. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Should we DIG? 

MS. DUBIN: The United States doesn't 

have and hasn't expressed a view on -- between 

the two options of dismissing the case as 

improvidently granted and affirming.  I think 

there are good reasons to affirm here on the 

Sohm damages rule and reverse that -- that rule. 

The circuits are divided on that 

question.  Eleven circuits apply a discovery 

rule, so the question of damages under that rule 

is important.  This Court granted certiorari to 

resolve that, and that conflict stems from a 

misreading of this Court's decision in Petrella. 

So this Court is uniquely situated to resolve

that conflict.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I mean, Justice

 Alito pointed out that antecedent -- the 

antecedent question is whether there's a 

discovery rule at all. Do you think the effect

 of doing that cleanup and resolving the circuit 

split will solidify the discovery rule in a way 

that then doesn't give the Court an opportunity 

to address it again if we think that the 

acceptance of the discovery rule is wrong? 

MS. DUBIN: To be candid, I think the 

discovery rule is pretty solidified as it is. 

Eleven courts of appeals apply that rule.  So I 

think it's unlikely to solidify it further. 

This Court does often grant certiorari 

on questions that bake in an assumption and then 

decide only that question, such as in the 

PROMESA case two years ago and U.S. Bank several 

years before that.  There is an assumption baked 

into both of those cases, and the Court goes on 

to resolve the question on which there is a 

circuit conflict. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And we're free then 

to just revisit it later if we ever decide, hey, 

there's an error that we want to correct?

MS. DUBIN: Justice Kagan, we do have

 strong views on two questions.  One, the damages 

rule applied by the Second Circuit is wrong. 

There's no textual basis for it. They misread

 this Court's decision in Petrella.  This Court

 could clarify that and do good in -- in

 providing uniform administration of copyright

 law.

 But the second thing that we have a 

strong view on is that you shouldn't do what 

Petitioner is asking you to do and go outside 

the reformulated question presented and address 

the question of accrual on a one-sided 

presentation from Petitioners' counsel. 

As this Court heard yesterday, the 

question of accrual is context-specific.  If you

The Second Circuit believed that

 Petrella imposed a separate bar on damages, 

separate from the question of accrual under the 

Copyright Act. But that's not the right reading

 of Petrella.

 What Petrella was trying to explain 

was that in a case in which your claims are 

untimely for acts of infringement that occurred

 more than three years before you filed suit, you 

can't then use claims within the limitation 

period to bootstrap in those claims. 

That's the way in which the separate 

accrual protects both the interests of 

defendants and plaintiffs. 

In Petrella itself, all claims for 

acts that occurred more than three years before 

she filed suit were untimely and she didn't try 

to invoke the discovery rule and couldn't have 

invoked the discovery rule because MGM's 

exploitation of Raging Bull was so open and 

notorious. 

But nothing in Petrella should be read 

to suggest that in a case in which a plaintiff 

could raise a timely claim for acts that 

occurred more than three years before it filed

 suit, she still can't recover damages.

 And I wanted to respond to 

Petitioners', you know, suggestion that we're 

suggesting in some way that Petrella is

 careless.  That is not our suggestion at all. 

Petrella reserved the question in Footnote 4 of

 the discovery accrual rule. 

But I think Petitioners' reading of 

Petrella would suggest that in the same opinion 

in which Justice Ginsburg reserved the question 

of whether the discovery rule applied, she also 

decided to gut it by eliminating damages 

thereunder with no textual basis for it, and I 

would submit that that's a far stranger reading 

of Petrella.

 resolves the circuit conflict and that rejects

 the circuit's -- Second Circuit's reasoning in

 Sohm. We think that that reasoning is correct 

and that Sohm appropriately rested on its

 reading of this Court's decision in Petrella.

 And I would note parenthetically that 

it's not just the majority opinion in Petrella,

 it's Justice Breyer's dissent and, indeed, even 

the government's own brief in Petrella that all 

seem to understand the statute of limitations 

the same way, namely, as a statute under which 

claims accrue, consistent with what the 

government has recently as a couple of terms ago 

described as the standard rule at the time of 

injury. 

And I would submit that Respondents 

have fully joined issue on the relevant part of 

this, which is the question of the extent to 

which the statutory language bears on the 

availability of retrospective relief. 

If you look at pages 32 to 40 of 

Respondents' brief, they make all of the 

arguments that are available to the best of my 

knowledge as to why "accrue" should not be given 

that standard meaning.

So that issue is fully teed up, and we 

rely on the statutory language, as this Court

 directed in the rephrased question presented,

 notwithstanding my friend, Mr. Earnhardt's 

careful parsing. I think that this Court 

directed the parties to address the statute of 

limitations, and we did so consistent with that, 

explaining how it bears on the question that 

this Court actually asked. 

Now we don't think that the Court 

needs to resolve the validity of the discovery 

rule, but let me explain why the Court may want 

to do that.  And the Court does, as Justice 

Gorsuch alluded to, have before it right now a 

petition in the Martinelli case presenting that 

issue. It is true that now 11 courts of appeals 

have accepted a broad-based discovery rule, 

though there are disputes -- pace, Mr. Earnhardt 

-- about how -- how that applies in the context 

of ownership claims, where it comes from and the 

like. 

I would submit that if this Court 

doesn't intervene here, particularly given what 

this Court has said about the discovery rule 

more recently, that it will really solidify the

 discovery rule in place.

 And how we know that is that both in 

the Second Circuit in Sohm and in the Fifth 

Circuit in Martinelli, parties raised the 

question of whether this Court's more recent 

case law discussing the bad wine of recent 

vintage cast doubt on discovery rules in those 

circuits and yet the courts continued to apply

 them. 

I take Justice Jackson's point that 

this Court assumes things in questions presented 

all the time, but I'm not aware of any precedent 

where the Court has assumed away the most 

relevant statutory language -- and we all agree 

that the language of 507(b) is the most relevant 

for purposes of resolving a question of 

statutory interpretation -- or a case where the 

Court has confined itself to the interpretations 

of particular courts of appeals. 

This Court is always free to reject 

all of the interpretations of the courts of 

appeals where they are wrong, and particularly 

here, where those interpretations rely on an 

outdated presumption in favor of the discovery 

rule that this Court has now definitively

 rejected, it would be artificial for the Court

 to do so.

 I recognize the desire for judicial

 modesty and incremental decision-making, but 

this is a context in which, as all of the amicus

 briefs and all of the commentary reflects, 

parties and lower courts are crying out for 

guidance on what is at bottom a simple question

 of statutory interpretation. 

So whether the Court does so in this 

case or whether it holds this case and then 

grants the Martinelli petition and resolves the 

broader questions here, we believe that the 

broader questions are important to litigants. 

They are really intertwined with the narrower 

question that Respondents and the government are 

asking this Court to resolve. 

And I do submit that it would really 

be unfortunate if this Court, however it decides 

this case, left in place lower court decisions 

that really cannot be reconciled with this 

Court's own precedents. 

The answer in this case is 

straightforward. All the Court need do is to 

apply the standard rule concerning the meaning
