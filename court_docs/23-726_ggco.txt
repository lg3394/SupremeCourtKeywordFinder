 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 23-726, Moyle

 versus United States, and the consolidated case.

 Mr. Turner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA N. TURNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

When Congress amended the Medicare Act 

in 1986, it put EMTALA on a centuries' old 

foundation of state law.  States have always 

been responsible for licensing doctors and 

setting the scope of their professional 

practice.  Indeed, EMTALA works precisely 

because states regulate the practice of 

medicine.  And nothing in EMTALA requires 

doctors to ignore the scope of their license and 

offer medical treatments that violate state law. 

Three statutory provisions make this 

clear. First, Section 1395, the Medicare Act's 

opening provision, forbids the federal 

government from controlling the practice of 

medicine.  That's the role of state regulation.

Second, subdivision (f) in EMTALA codifies a

 statutory presumption against preemption of

 state medical regulations.  And, third, EMTALA's 

stabilization provision is limited to available

 treatments, which depends on the scope of the

 hospital staff's medical license.  Illegal 

treatments are not available treatments.

 Add in this Court's own presumption 

against preemption of state regulations, combine 

that with the need for clear and unambiguous 

Spending Clause conditions, and the 

administration's reading becomes wholly 

untenable. 

The administration's misreading also 

lacks any limiting principle.  If ER doctors can 

perform whatever treatment they determine is 

appropriate, then doctors can ignore not only 

state abortion laws but also state regulations 

on opioid use and informed consent requirements. 

That turns the presumption against preemption on 

its head and leaves emergency rooms unregulated 

under state law. 

It's unsurprising that no court has 

endorsed such an expansive view of EMTALA, and 

until Dobbs, nor had HHS.  Everyone understands

that licensing laws limit medical practice. 

That's why a nurse isn't available to perform

 open-heart surgery, no matter the need, no 

matter her knowledge. The answer doesn't change 

just because we're talking about abortion.

 The Court should reject the 

administration's unlimited reading of EMTALA and 

reverse the district court's judgment.

 I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  The -- normally, when 

we have a preemption case, there's some 

relationship between the parties.  Is the state 

being regulated by the federal government under 

EMTALA, or is the state in -- engaged in some 

sort of quasi-contractual relationship? 

MR. TURNER: Yes, Your Honor.  In this 

case, the state -- Idaho, for example, has no 

state hospitals that participate in -- with the 

emergency rooms in EMTALA.  And so, in this 

case, there isn't even a quasi-relationship. 

The parties being regulated by EMTALA here are 

hospitals and doctors. 

And I think your question is getting 

at the Armstrong issue, and we think that is a 

significant question.  It wasn't part of the

question presented. We think the Indiana amicus

 brief raises significant questions and deals

 with that argument well.  But the question 

presented here is one of direct conflict between 

Idaho's law and EMTALA, and on that question, we

 don't think it's hard at all.

 And, Your Honors, going to that direct

 conflict, I think, if you consider the express

 limitation within the statute of availability --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, before we do 

that, can I just step back and get your 

understanding of the statute?  You made some 

representations as to how you see it working. 

And so let me tell you what I think, and then 

you can tell me whether you agree, disagree, or 

otherwise. 

So I -- I think that there are two 

things that are plain, pretty plain, on this --

the face of this statute. One is that EMTALA is 

about the provision of stabilizing care for 

people who are experiencing emergency medical 

conditions.  That's one thing I think the 

statute is doing. 

And I also think that it is operating 

to displace the prerogatives of hospitals or

 narrow slice of the healthcare universe.  This 

idea of emergency medical services is like one

 very minor part or small part of -- of the sort

 of overall healthcare -- provision of

 healthcare.

 So what that means is that when a 

hospital wants to only provide stabilizing care

 in emergencies for people who can pay for it, 

for example, EMTALA says, no, I'm sorry, you 

have to stabilize anyone who's experiencing an 

emergency medical condition, or when a hospital 

wants to provide stabilizing treatments to 

people who are experiencing only certain kinds 

of emergency conditions, EMTALA says, no, here's 

the list of conditions and you have to provide 

stabilizing care for those people. 

Similarly, if a state says, look, it's 

our job to govern all of healthcare in our state 

and we say that only certain kinds of healthcare 

can be given to people who are experiencing 

emergency medical conditions, we don't want 

whatever treatment, we want only certain kinds 

of treatment, EMTALA says, no, we are directing 

that as a matter of federal law, when someone

to be assessed and the hospital must do what is

 Is that your understanding of the

 statute?

 MR. TURNER:  Partially, Your Honor.

 We agree that EMTALA does impose a federal 

stabilization requirement, but the question here 

is what is the content of that stabilization 

requirement, and for that, you have to reference 

state law. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I could just -- I 

mean, I think what you just said is important 

because, when you concede that EMTALA imposes a 

stabilization requirement, it is, this statute, 

the federal government interfering, if you will, 

in a state's healthcare choices. 

So EMTALA is on its face a statute 

that says it's not all the state's way. There 

are federal requirements here.  There is a 

requirement to stabilize emergency patients. 

And you agree with that? 

MR. TURNER: Yeah, Justice Kagan, we

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- we can just take 

off the table this idea that, you know, just 

because it's a state and it's healthcare, that 

the federal government has nothing to say about 

it. The federal government has plenty to say 

about it in this statute. 

Now, you're right, now there's a 

question of what's the content of this 

stabilization requirement.  And as far as I 

understood your opening remarks, you say, well, 

this is left to the states. 

But, if I'm just looking at the 

statute, the statute tells you what the content 

of the stabilization requirement is.  It's "to 

provide such medical treatment [...] as may be 

necessary to assure, within reasonable [...] 

probability, that no material deterioration of 

the condition is likely" to occur if the person 

were transferred or didn't get care.

 know, it's a standard that clearly has reference

 to accepted medical practice, not just whatever

 one doctor happens to think.

 But it's here is the content of the

 standard.  You have to stabilize.  What does 

that mean? It means to provide the treatment 

necessary to assure within reasonable medical 

probability that no material deterioration 

occurs. 

MR. TURNER:  Yeah, let me respond in 

two ways.  First, the objective standard that 

you set forth there in that understanding is 

contrary to the administration's view.  They say 

it is a totally subjective standard and whatever 

treatment a doctor determines is appropriate, 

that's --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think that that's 

not true.  I mean, I think you could -- guys can 

argue about this yourself.  But, as I understand 

the Solicitor General's brief -- and we'll see 

what the Solicitor General says -- but the 

Solicitor General says it's not up to every 

individual doctor.  This is a standard that is 

objective that incorporates accepted medical

 MR. TURNER: Well, and the more 

fundamental point is the definition that you

 quoted of stabilizing care in the operative

 position -- provision in (b)(1) is also

 textually explicitly qualified by that which is

 "within the staff and facilities available at a

 hospital."  So then we come --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. And that just 

means --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that's -- right. 

That's quite right.  It says "within the staff 

and facilities available at the hospital." And 

if you just look at that language, I mean, it's 

absolutely clear that that's not a reference to 

what state law involves.  The staff and 

facilities available. 

If you don't have staff available to 

provide the medical care, then I guess you can't 

provide the medical care. If you don't have the 

facilities available to provide the medical 

care, then you can't provide the medical care. 

A transfer has to take place for the good of the 

patient.

 facilities?  Or is it better for the patient to 

transfer them to the hospital a few miles away?

you have the right doctors?  How do you answer

has or the hospital has that would prevent that 

care from being provided.  That's -- that's the 

work of the statute.

that is our argument. 

They want to now draw it far more 

narrow and look only at physical availability. 

We agree that's a component, but there's also a 

legal availability component here too. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, the 

problem we're having right now is that you're 

sort of putting preemption on its head. The 

whole purpose of preemption is to say that if 

the state passes a law that violates federal 

law, the state law is no longer effective.

conditions that could save a person from serious

 injury or death.

 MR. TURNER: Yeah, I think there are

 two crucial responses to your point.  Let me

 begin with the preemption point.

           Subdivision (f) and Section 1395

 actually are telling HHS, the federal 

government, and courts just the opposite, that 

you don't --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it's saying 

you can't preempt unless there's a direct 

conflict.  If objective medical care requires 

you to treat women who are -- who present the 

potential of serious medical complications and

that, you have to do it. 

MR. TURNER: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Idaho law says the 

doctor has to determine not that there's merely 

a serious medical condition but that the person 

will die.

 Idaho's Defense of Life Act permits.  We agree

no federal law on the book that prohibits any 

state from saying, even if a woman will die, you 

can't perform an abortion.

administration's reliance on a standard like 

best clinical evidence or some national norm, I 

think that's very fraught because what it really 

is saying is the text itself doesn't address 

what stabilizing treatment is required. 

You go outside the text to 

professional standards that are floating out

really boils down to a question between a

 clarify?  Because I'm not sure I understand.

 You know, sort of looking at this from 

a broader perspective, it seems to me that 

EMTALA says you must provide whatever treatment 

you have the capacity, meaning staff and 

facilities, to provide to stabilize patients who 

are experiencing emergency medical conditions.

 Idaho law seems to say you cannot

 provide that treatment unless doing so is 

necessary to prevent a patient's death to the 

extent the treatment involves abortion. 

Why is that not a direct conflict? 

You have "you must" in a certain situation, 

that's what the federal government is saying, 

and "you cannot if it involves abortion" says 

Idaho. 

MR. TURNER: I think the nurse example 

really highlights the reason why, because a 

nurse might be available.  The nurse may be --

may even think she knows how to, and under the 

flat "must" provision in EMTALA, the 

administration's reading would say call her into 

action, put her into the operating room, and 

open the patient up. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  And you --

 the -- let's say the administration's position 

is that nurse can do it. 

Are you suggesting that federal law

 would not take precedence, would not preempt a 

state law that says no, she can't? 

MR. TURNER: Well, whether federal law 

could do that is a different question than 

whether EMTALA here does do that. And I think 

the answer is clear that it doesn't. 

I mean, it's like the Gonzales v. 

Oregon case, where the Controlled Substances 

Act, you know, this Court noted that that was --

the -- the provisions there rely upon and -- and 

assume a medical profession being regulated by 

state police powers.  That's the same with 

EMTALA.  EMTALA is a four-page statute.

of care for every conceivable medical 

treatment in a --

leave that to the medical community.  It said,

 you know, the -- it -- Congress was not going to 

address every treatment for every condition, but 

it said you do what is needed to assure

 non-deterioration.

 So I guess the question here is, do

 you concede that with respect to certain medical 

conditions, an abortion is the standard of care? 

MR. TURNER: No, because a standard of 

care under Idaho -- well, I should say, in 

Idaho, there is a life-saving exception for 

certain abortions, and that is the standard of 

care. And the standard of care is necessarily 

set and determined by state --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think you have 

to concede that with respect to certain medical 

conditions abortion is the standard of care 

because your own statute, as interpreted by your 

own courts, acknowledges that when a -- a 

condition gets bad enough such that the woman's 

life is in peril, then the -- the -- the doctors 

are supposed to give abortions.

that's true is that with respect to certain rare 

but extremely obviously important conditions and 

circumstances, abortion is the accepted medical

 standard of care.  Isn't that right?

 MR. TURNER: Yes, and that's -- that 

was my point, that there is a life-saving

 exception under Idaho law.  Now the question

 here is --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- now the question 

is, is it also the accepted standard of care 

when, rather than the woman's life being in 

peril, the woman's health is in peril? 

So let's take -- you know, all of 

these cases are rare, but within these rare 

cases, there's a significant number where the 

woman is -- her life is not in peril, but she's 

going to lose her reproductive organs, she's 

going to lose the ability to have children in 

the future, unless an abortion takes place. 

Now that's the category of cases in 

which EMTALA says, my gosh, of course, the 

abortion is necessary to assure that no material 

deterioration occurs.  And yet Idaho says,

that these patients are now helicoptered out of

 MR. TURNER: Yeah.  Your Honor, the --

the hypothetical you raise is a very difficult 

situation, and these situations, I mean, nobody

 is arguing that they don't raise tough medical 

questions that implicate deeply theological and

 moral questions.  And Idaho, like 22 other 

states, and even Congress in EMTALA recognizes 

that there are two patients to consider in those 

circumstances.  And the two-patient scenario is 

-- is tough when you have these competing 

interests. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, it -- it --

that would be a good response if federal law did 

not take a position on what you characterize as 

a tough question, but federal law does take a 

position on that question.  It says that you 

don't have to wait until the person is on the 

verge of death.  If the woman is going to lose 

her reproductive organs, that's enough to 

trigger this duty on the part of the hospital to 

stabilize the patient.  And the way to stabilize 

patients in these circumstances, all doctors

tri-semester at 16 weeks, goes to the ER because 

she felt a -- a gush of fluid leave her body. 

She was diagnosed with PPROM.  The doctors 

believe that a medical intervention to terminate 

her pregnancy is needed to reduce the -- real 

medical possibility of experiencing sepsis and

there refused to treat her because they couldn't

 say she would die.

 She was horrified, went home. The

 next day, she bled.  She passed out.  Thankfully

 taken to the hospital.  There, she received an 

abortion because she was about to die.

 to have medical certainty.  The Idaho Supreme

 Court answered that question --

patient, they tried -- had to deliver her baby.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 Is there -- what happens if a dispute 

arises with respect to whether or not the doctor 

was within the confines of Idaho law or -- or

 wasn't?  Is the doctor subjected to review by a

 medical authority?  Exactly how is that

 evaluated?

 Because it's an obvious concern.  If 

-- if -- if you have an individual exception for 

a doctor, and they were having a debate about is 

that covered by your submission that nothing in 

Idaho law prohibits complying with EMTALA, I 

mean, who -- who makes the decision whether or 

not something's within or without? 

MR. TURNER: So, I mean, I -- I 

imagine there are two ways the law can be 

enforced or at least two. The Board of Medicine 

has a licensing oversight over a doctor.  And 

the Idaho Supreme Court made clear that that 

doctor's medical judgment is not going to be 

judged based on an objective standard, what a 

reasonable doctor would do.  That's not the 

standard. 

The second way would be if a --

 interpreted what the -- what the state supreme

 court said.

 Now you have been presented here today

 with very quick summaries of cases and asked to 

provide a snap judgment about what would be 

appropriate in those particular cases, and,

 honestly, I -- I think you've hardly been given

 an opportunity to answer some of the

 hypotheticals. 

But would you agree with me that if a 

medical doctor, who is an expert in this field, 

were asked, bang, bang, bang, what would you do 

in these particular circumstances which I am now 

going to enumerate, the doctor would say:  Wait, 

I don't -- I -- this is not how I practice 

medicine.  I need to know a lot more about the 

individual case. 

Would you agree with that? 

MR. TURNER: Absolutely.  And ACOG has 

-- you know, in the case of PROM, for example, 

ACOG doesn't just knee-jerk say an abortion is 

the standard of care.  ACOG itself says that 

expectant management is oftentimes the

that turn on the facts that are on the ground 

between the doctor as he is assessing them with 

his medical judgment that he's bringing to bear 

but is also necessarily constrained by Idaho

 law. Just like every other area of the practice 

of medicine, state law confines doctor judgment

 in some ways.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Sotomayor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a 

difference between stabilizing a person who 

presents a serious medical condition requiring 

stabilization than a person who presents with a 

condition, quoting Idaho's words, where there is 

a -- poses a great risk of death to the pregnant 

woman. You agree there's daylight between the 

two? 

MR. TURNER: We agree, and I think 

this is most --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so there will 

be some women who present serious medical 

condition that the federal law would require to 

be treated who will not be treated under Idaho 

law?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's my

your legal theories rely on us holding that 

federal law doesn't require -- cannot preempt

 state law on these issues.

 And so, when I asked you the question

 if a state defines likelihood of death more

 stringently than Idaho does, you would say 

there's no federal law that would prohibit them

 from doing that?

 MR. TURNER: Well, I would say that 

EMTALA does not contain a standard of --

requires stabilizing treatment and not equal 

treatment of patients, which was a position you

patients who required an abortion as a

 stabilizing treatment.

 Congress discussed that topic in the 

Affordable Care Act and explicitly said that

 nothing in the Affordable Care Act shall be 

construed to relieve any healthcare provider 

from providing emergency services as required by

 state or federal law. 

Medical providers have -- told us that 

for decades they have understood both federal 

law and state law to require abortions as 

stabilizing conditions for people presenting 

serious medical risk.  Lower courts, there's at 

least cases of lower courts saying you have to 

provide abortion. 

So this is not a post-Dobbs

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And one of those 

standards of care with respect to abortion is 

that in certain tragic circumstances, as you

 yourself, as your own state's law acknowledges, 

where a woman's life is in peril and abortion is 

the appropriate standard of care, isn't that

 right?

 MR. TURNER: That's right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And EMTALA goes 

further.  It says that the appropriate standard 

of care can't only be about protecting a woman's 

life. It also has to be about protecting a 

woman's health.  That's what EMTALA says, 

doesn't it? 

MR. TURNER: No, it doesn't.  It 

defines "emergency medical condition" with a 

broader set of triggering conditions, but the --

the key question here is what is the 

stabilization requirement, and that is qualified 

by the availability term. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This -- this -- the 

stabilization requirement is -- is written in 

terms of making sure that a -- a transfer would 

not result in a material deterioration as to the 

emergency condition.  Nothing about has to be at

care in this circumstance for this condition is

 X, not Y. Opioids, for example.

           In New Jersey, a doctor cannot 

stabilize chronic pain with more than a five-day

 supply of opioids.  In Pennsylvania, it can be 

seven. In other states, there is no limit.

 Their reading of EMTALA requires that those

 limitations get wiped out and you impose a

 national standard. 

There are numerous -- other instances 

where states are coming in and saying, in our 

state, the practice of medicine must conform to 

this standard.  And Idaho has done that with 

abortion.  It's done it with opioids.  It's done 

it with marijuana use. There are countless 

examples, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And your theory --

although the Supreme Court has narrowed the 

reach of your statute, your theory would apply 

even if it hadn't?  I mean, it would apply to 

ectopic pregnancies.  It would apply even if 

there were not a death exception. 

I mean, all of your theory would apply 

no matter what, really, Idaho did, wouldn't it?

answer is EMTALA doesn't speak to that, but

 there are other background principles and 

limitations like rational basis review, Justice 

Rehnquist, the Chief Justice recognized --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But your theory of

 EMTALA is that EMTALA preempts none of it? That 

a state tomorrow could say even if death is 

around the corner, a state tomorrow could say 

even if there's an ectopic pregnancy, that still 

that's a -- that's a -- a -- a -- a choice of 

the state and EMTALA has nothing to say about 

it? 

MR. TURNER: Yeah.  And that 

understanding is a humble one with respect to 

the federalism role of states as the primary 

care providers for their citizens, not the 

federal government. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It may be too humble 

for women's health, you know?  Okay.  Thank you.

As I read your briefs, you thought --

Idaho thinks that in cases of molar and ectopic

 pregnancies, for example, that -- that an

 abortion is acceptable.

 MR. TURNER: Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And the example of

 someone who isn't immediately going to die but 

may at some point in the future, that that would

 be acceptable? 

MR. TURNER: It -- it goes back to the 

good-faith medical standard, but, yes, if the 

doctor should determine -- cannot determine in 

good faith that death is going to afflict that 

woman, then no --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So it -- it doesn't 

matter whether it happens tomorrow or next week 

or a month from now? 

MR. TURNER: There is no imminency 

requirement.  This whole notion of delayed care 

is just not consistent with the Idaho Supreme 

Court's reading of the statute and what the 

statute says. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And the good faith, 

as I read the Idaho Supreme Court opinion, that

MR. TURNER: Absolutely, it is.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  And then 

what do we do with the -- EMTALA's definition of

 "individual" to include both the woman and, as 

the statute says, the unborn child?

 MR. TURNER: Yeah.  It's -- you know,

 we're not saying, Your Honor, that EMTALA

 prohibits abortions.  So, for example, in 

California, stabilizing treatment may involve 

abortions consistent with what that state law 

allows its doctors to perform. 

But I think our point with the unborn 

child amendment in 1989 is that it would be a 

very strange thing for Congress to expressly 

amend EMTALA to require care for unborn 

children, and it's not just when the child --

when the mother is experiencing active labor. 

The definition of the "emergency medical 

condition" requires care when the child itself 

has an emergency medical condition regardless of 

what's going on with the mother. 

And so it would be a strange thing for 

Congress to have regard for the unborn child and 

yet also be mandating termination of unborn 

children.

You say in your reply brief, and so 

too the -- the Moyle reply brief says, that for 

each of the conditions identified by the 

Solicitor General where, under their view of 

EMTALA, an abortion must be available, you say 

in the reply brief that Idaho law, in fact, 

allows an abortion in each of those 

circumstances, and you go through them on pages 

8 and 9 of the reply brief, each of the 

conditions. 

Is there any condition that you're 

aware of where the Solicitor General says EMTALA 

requires that an abortion be available in an 

emergency circumstance where Idaho law, as

 MR. TURNER: And my view is that

 yes -- and I'm going to reference Footnote 5 

from the gray brief -- the mental health 

condition situation.  The administration says 

that's not on the table.  That's not a scenario 

where abortion is the only stabilizing care 

required.  And I'm not sure where that construct 

of "only stabilizing care" comes from because, 

under their view, it's the doctor's 

determination that controls, not this imposed 

"only" requirement. 

But be that as it may, the American 

Psychiatric Association -- and -- and so I'm 

taking General Prelogar up on her offer in

organizations that set abortion as a standard of 

care.

 are imperative for mental health conditions. 

That sounds like a necessity to me. And I don't

 know how, if a woman presents at seven months 

pregnant in an Idaho emergency room and says, 

I'm experiencing severe depression from this 

pregnancy, I'm having suicidal ideation from 

carrying this pregnancy forth, that that 

wouldn't under the administration's reading be 

the only stabilizing care. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So you think the 

Ninth Circuit panel, when it said every 

circumstance described by the administration's 

declarations involved life-threatening 

circumstances under which Idaho law would allow 

an abortion, is what the Ninth Circuit panel 

said? 

MR. TURNER: We agree with that 

because the conditions identified in the 

affidavits were all conditions that would fit 

under the life-saving exception, and that's 

telling because, you know, these doctors, when 

put under oath in an affidavit, couldn't come up 

with any of these harrowing circumstances.  They 

identified other ones.

But I think what the government

 health exception here. That is -- I -- I just 

don't know how you can read their 

understanding and --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well -- well, I'm 

just trying to figure out is there really a --

other than the mental health, which we haven't 

had a lot of briefing about, is there any other 

condition identified by the Solicitor General 

where you think Idaho law would not allow a 

physician in his or her good-faith judgment to 

perform an emergency abortion? 

MR. TURNER: Not in their affidavits. 

They maintain nonetheless that when you compare 

the definition of what an emergency medical 

condition is, it is broader than the definition 

of the life-saving exception in Idaho law. And 

so they present this --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, that's what 

they -- they say, but then, when we get down to 

the actual conditions that are listed, the 

examples -- and Justice Sotomayor was going

the determination on whether there are any

 real-world conditions without first answering 

the statutory interpretation question of what

 requires.  That has to be addressed, and it has

 to be addressed not only because that's where

 And on the mental health thing, the SG

 says -- I just picked it up to check Footnote

 5 -- "Idaho badly errs in asserting that 

construing EMTALA according to its terms would

 turn 'emergency rooms into federal abortion

 enclaves' by allowing pregnancy termination for

 'mental health' concerns."

 So, if that's the only space that you 

can identify where Idaho would preclude an 

abortion and EMTALA would require one, and the

EMTALA doesn't curb Idaho's authority to enforce

 its law, what's --

MR. TURNER: Well, it can't under the 

injunction because the injunction says that 

Idaho's law is preempted in an incredibly broad

 range of circumstances to avoid --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  As -- as it

 conflicts with EMTALA, I thought. 

MR. TURNER: It -- it -- it is much 

broader than that.  It's -- and in -- this was 

based on the proffered injunction by the 

administration to avoid an emergency medical 

condition, not in the face of an emergency 

medical condition. 

So what that means is Idaho's law 

can't even operate when a doctor determines that 

a condition might need to be avoided that hasn't 

yet presented itself.  That's far broader than 

the emergency medical condition and 

stabilization requirement under EMTALA because 

the stabilization requirement under EMTALA is 

only triggered when there has been a 

determination that a --

I would like to hear the Solicitor General's

 response to that.

 But let me just ask you one other

 thing about the mental health consideration

 because I can -- I can understand Idaho's point 

that a mental health exception would be far 

broader than Idaho law and have the potential to 

expand the availability of abortion far beyond 

what Idaho law permits. 

But the stabilization requirement only 

exists up until transfer, right, until transfer 

is possible?  So it's hard for me to see how, 

with a mental health condition, that couldn't be 

stabilized before needing to transfer, right? 

At that point, the Idaho hospital 

could say: Well, you're -- you're stable, 

you're not immediately going to be suicidal, 

we'll leave you in the care of, you know, a 

parent or a partner who will then seek 

appropriate treatment. 

MR. TURNER: Well, that flexible view 

of stabilization is very different than the 

government's very rigid view of stabilization, 

which is, if an emergency medical condition 

calls for an abortion, it's got to be provided

 right there and then if it's available in this

 very limited sense.  And so the stabilization

 continuum that you're talking about, I agree, 

that's built into EMTALA because --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  The statute says

 until transfer is possible.

 MR. TURNER: Well, the -- the transfer

 provision kicks in if a hospital is unable to

 stabilize a condition.  And so, if a patient 

presents at a hospital and that hospital has the 

capability, the availability to stabilize the 

condition, in the case of mental health, I 

invite General Prelogar to come up here and tell 

you that I've got it all wrong and that, you 

know, the mother that I described would not need 

to receive stabilization in that circumstance 

and instead would be transferred to a 

psychiatric hospital or something and that 

wouldn't constitute dumping under their reading. 

I just don't see how that comports 

with everything they've said about the rigid 

view of stabilization that if a condition calls 

for it and a hospital can do it, it's got to be 

done there and then.

kind of conscience exemption for doctors under

 state law?

 MR. TURNER: It does.  And there are

 federal conscience protections as well. And I

 think that is a key point here, Your Honor.

 The administration told this Court in 

the FDA case that individual doctors are never 

required to perform an abortion from what I

 could tell, but that doesn't extend to 

hospitals.  And so, in the case of Catholic 

hospitals -- and there are hundreds of them 

treating millions of patients every year --

under the administration's reading, Catholic 

hospitals who faithfully adhere to the ethical 

and religious directives are now required to 

perform abortions. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Is that because no 

federal conscience exemption applies? 

MR. TURNER: I don't know why they say 

that's the line that they draw between 

individual doctors and religious institutions 

because Coats-Snowe on its face seems to cover 

both.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I'm really surprised

 to hear you say that Idaho law permits

 everything that the federal law requires.  So I

 just -- I'm trying to understand that because it 

seems to me that if that's the case, then why

 couldn't emergency room physicians in Idaho just 

ignore Idaho law and follow the federal

 standard? 

I mean, if the -- if -- if the state 

is doing exactly what the -- what the federal 

law says is required, if it's okay by Idaho, 

then, fine, we set Idaho aside.  We do what the 

federal law says, and we all go home. 

MR. TURNER: Well, I mean, our 

reading, of course, is that there is no 

conflict.  And so as doctors aren't having to 

make this choice of do I follow EMTALA or do I 

follow --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So your 

representation on the -- on behalf of Idaho is 

that if a -- an emergency room physician in 

Idaho follows EMTALA in terms of when an

 MR. TURNER: Yes, because they have to 

comply with Idaho law to comply with EMTALA.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no.  I'm asking

 you, if they -- if they comply with EMTALA, will 

they necessarily have satisfied the requirements

 of Idaho law?  Because that's what you seemed to

 say in response to Justice Kavanaugh and in 

response to Justice Barrett.  So I just want to 

make clear if that's the position of the State. 

MR. TURNER: EMTALA's stable -- the

necessarily determined by Idaho law in this 

case. So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No.  You're saying, 

if they follow Idaho law, then they will be 

following EMTALA law.

 other possibility.  You seem to be saying every 

situation in which the United States says here's

 a stabilization situation that the United States

 would say the person has to have an abortion,

 the -- the -- the physicians would say we're

 following EM -- EMTALA and abortion is required,

 I thought you said in response to Justice

 Kavanaugh, yes, Idaho law would also say that's 

a situation in which an abortion is allowed. 

If that's the case, then it seems to 

me there is no daylight, there's no conflict, as 

you've said, but it's because Idaho law is in --

full compliance with what the federal law is 

saying.  We're getting it wrong, you're saying. 

Like this death thing, that's not what we really 

mean. What we mean is whenever it's necessary 

to stabilize a patient who is experiencing 

deterioration, as federal law requires. 

MR. TURNER: No.  I -- I think I 

understand the point that you're making.  And 

the best way that I can think of -- of it, Your 

Honor, is that EMTALA's stabilization 

requirement requires medical judgment to 

determine what is the appropriate stabilizing 

treatment, right?

And how does a doctor exercise medical

 judgment?  Well, his training, his experience, 

perhaps reference to professional standards of

 care that are national, but --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  How about -- how

 about --

MR. TURNER: -- necessarily state law

 standards as well.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- how -- how about 

-- that's not just something you're sort of 

coming up with.  I mean, as Justice Kagan said 

at the beginning, EMTALA tells the doctor how 

he's supposed to decide it in this particular 

circumstance with reference to the medical 

standards of care concerning when a patient is 

deteriorating in an emergency -- condition 

situation. 

MR. TURNER: Yeah, EMTALA --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, if that's the 

standard in EMTALA, are you representing that 

that is exactly what Idaho is saying so that all 

the doctors need to do is follow EMTALA and 

they'll be fine under Idaho law?

 EMTALA.  The question is how do doctors comply 

with EMTALA, and EMTALA --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let me ask you

 another question.  Let me -- I -- I think I

 understand your point.  You're saying Idaho is

 actually -- or could actually be requiring more

 and it -- the federal law has to make them -- or

 it -- do what Idaho says.

 MR. TURNER: Well, and it's important 

that --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah. 

MR. TURNER: -- EMTALA itself, it --

it codifies this presumption of a backdrop of 

state law. There are background principles 

here, and that's what --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me 

explore that with you for just a second. 

I -- I had thought that this case was 

about preemption and that the entirety of our 

preemption jurisprudence is the notion that the 

federal government in certain circumstances can 

make policy pronouncements that differ from what 

the state may want or what anybody else may 

want, and the Supremacy Clause says that what 

the federal government says takes precedent.

So you've been saying over and over

 again Idaho is, you know, a state and we have

 healthcare policy choices and we've made --

we've set a standard of care in this situation.

 All that's true.  But the question is 

to what extent can the federal government say: 

No, in this situation, our standard is going to

 apply?

 MR. TURNER: And --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  That's what the 

government is saying, and I don't understand 

how, consistent with our preemption 

jurisprudence, you can be saying otherwise. 

MR. TURNER: Yeah, and -- and if I can 

put a finer point on it.  I don't think it's --

the question is necessarily what can Congress do 

but what did Congress do here with EMTALA, and 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So what 

did it do here? 

MR. TURNER: Yeah.  It started, it 

opened the Medicare Act by saying the federal 

government shall not control the practice of 

medicine.  And then, in EMTALA itself, it says 

state laws are not preempted.  And then, when it

condition nature of this requires Congress to

 speak clearly and unequivocally that it is

 imposing a abortion mandate.  It -- that's not 

here in the statute.

 And, secondly, this Court's

 presumption --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But doesn't that

 make abortion different?  I mean, what do you 

mean? They say provide whatever is necessary to 

stabilize.  So you're saying they'd have to say 

provide whatever is necessary, including 

abortion?  That's the only way that is taken 

account of here? 

MR. TURNER: No, what I'm saying is, 

when we -- when we go and look at the phrase 

"available" and what it means, the government --

the administration is saying, well, they're 

adding this tag that says consistent with state 

law. 

And we're saying no, under the clear 

statement canon, it's the presumption against 

preemption.  What the government actually --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

EMTALA's promise is simple but 

profound.  No one who comes to an emergency room 

in need of urgent treatment should be denied 

necessary stabilizing care.  This case is about 

how that guarantee applies to pregnant women in 

medical crisis. 

In some tragic cases, women suffer 

emergency complications that make continuing 

their pregnancy a grave threat to their lives or 

their health.  A woman whose amniotic sac has 

ruptured prematurely, for example, needs 

immediate treatment to avoid a serious risk of 

infection that could cascade into sepsis and the 

risk of hysterectomy.  A woman with severe 

preeclampsia can face a high risk of kidney

failure that could require life-long dialysis.

 In cases like these, where there is no

 other way to stabilize the woman's medical

 condition and prevent her from deteriorating, 

EMTALA's plain text requires that she be offered

 pregnancy termination as the necessary

 treatment.  And that's how this law has been 

understood and applied for decades.

 That usually poses no conflict with 

state law. Even states that have sharply 

restricted access to abortion after Dobbs 

generally allow exceptions to safeguard the 

mother's health.  But Idaho makes termination a 

felony punishable by years of imprisonment 

unless it's necessary to prevent the woman's 

death. 

I think I understood my friend today 

to acknowledge several times that there is 

daylight between that standard and the necessary 

stabilizing treatment that EMTALA would require. 

And the Idaho Supreme Court recognized the same 

thing when it specifically contrasted the 

"necessary to prevent death" exception and said 

it was materially narrower than a prior Idaho 

law that had a health exception that tracked

 EMTALA.

 The situation on the ground in Idaho 

is showing the devastating consequences of that

 gap. Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in

 Idaho are in an impossible position.  If a woman 

comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat 

to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, 

doctors either have to delay treatment and allow

 her condition to material -- to materially 

deteriorate, or they're airlifting her out of 

the state so she can get the emergency care that 

she needs.  One hospital system in Idaho says 

that right now it's having to transfer pregnant 

women in medical crisis out of the state about 

once every other week. That's untenable, and 

EMTALA does not countenance it. 

None of Petitioners' interpretations 

fit with the text, and so they have tried to 

make this case be about the broader debate for 

access to abortion in cases of unwanted 

pregnancy.  But that's not what this case is 

about at all.  Idaho's ban on abortion is 

enforceable in virtually all of its 

applications, but in the narrow circumstances 

involving grave medical emergencies, Idaho

 EMTALA requires.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, are you 

aware of any other Spending Clause legislation

 that preempts criminal law?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  With respect to 

criminal law in particular, Justice Thomas, I'm

 not immediately thinking of relevant cases.  We 

have a whole string cite of cases in our brief 

at page 46 that reflect times where the Court 

has recognized the preemptive force of Spending 

Clause legislation, including in situations 

where the funding restrictions apply to private 

parties, so that could include the Coventry 

Health case, for example.  Lead-Deadwood is 

another one -- example of this.  But I'm not 

immediately recalling how that would apply in 

criminal law. 

Of course, this Court hasn't drawn 

those kinds of distinctions in recognizing the 

force of the Supremacy Clause. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Now the -- normally, 

when we have a -- a -- a preemption case, it's a 

regulated party who is involved in the suit, and

example, in Wyeth or something.

 On the -- in this case, you are 

bringing an action against the state, and the 

state's not regulated. Are there other examples 

of these types of suits?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Sure.  I mean,

 there are numerous examples where the United 

States has sought to protect its sovereign 

interests in situations where a state has done 

what Idaho has done here and interposed a law 

that conflicts.  So I'd point to Arizona versus 

United States as an example of that.  United 

States versus Washington.  There are a number of 

cases where this Court has recognized that the 

federal government can protect its interests in 

this kind of preemption action. 

And -- and, as I'd mentioned before, 

the Court has a long line of cases recognizing 

that that preemption principle applies in the 

context of federal funding restrictions that 

apply to private parties too.

that you're bringing the action against is not a

because what Idaho has done here is directly

 interfered with the ability of the regulated 

parties who have taken these funds, federal

 funds with conditions attached, from being able 

to comply with the federal law that governs

 their behavior.  And this was an essential part 

of the bargain that the federal government

 struck with hospitals in substantially investing 

in their hospital systems. 

And what the state has done is said 

you, through our operation of state law, are no 

longer permitted to comply with this fundamental 

stabilization requirement in EMTALA in this 

narrow category of cases.

actually be asserting the preemption that you're 

talking about?

your argument about preemption here squares with 

the theory of Spending Clause -- of Congress's 

Spending Clause power.  The theory is Congress 

can tell a state or any other entity or person, 

look, here's some money or other thing of value, 

and if you want to accept it, fine, then you 

have to accept certain conditions. 

But how does the -- the Congress's 

ability to do that authorize it to impose duties 

on another party that has not agreed to accept 

this money?

being imposed on Idaho here.  It's not required 

to provide emergency stabilizing treatment 

itself.  The duties are -- are --

is, if a woman goes to an emergency room and she

 has a condition that requires an abortion in 

order to eliminate "serious jeopardy" to her

 "health," the hospital must perform the abortion

 or transfer the woman to another hospital where 

that can be done.

 complications that we have focused on generally

 occur in early pregnancy, often before the point 

of viability. There can be complications that

 happen after viability, but there, the standard

 of care is to deliver the baby if you need the

 pregnancy to end because it's causing these 

severe health consequences for the mom.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if it --

delivering the baby is not an option?  You're

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And here's why.

 It's because that wouldn't do anything to 

address the underlying brain chemistry issue

 that's causing the -- the mental health

 emergency in the first place.  This is not about

 mental health generally.  This is about 

treatment by ER doctors in an emergency room. 

And when a woman comes in with some grave mental 

health emergency, if she happens to be pregnant, 

it would be incredibly unethical to terminate 

her pregnancy.  She might not be in a position 

to give any informed consent.  Instead, the way 

you treat mental health emergency is to address 

what's happening in the brain.  If you're having 

a psychotic episode, you administer 

antipsychotics. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I really 

want a simple, clear-cut answer to this question 

so that going forward everybody will know what 

the federal government's position is. Does 

"health" mean only physical health, or does it 

also include mental health?

what qualifies as an emergency medical 

condition, it can include grave mental health

emergencies, but let me be very clear about our

 position.  That could never lead to pregnancy 

termination because that is not the accepted 

standard of practice to treat any mental health

 emergency.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does the term "serious

 jeopardy" in -- in (e)(1) -- (1)(i) mean an 

immediate serious risk, or may a risk of serious

 consequences at some future point suffice? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The standard is --

is defined in terms of whether you need 

immediate medical treatment.  And so the 

relevant question is, in the absence of 

immediate medical treatment, are you going to 

have this serious jeopardy to your health, 

dysfunction of your organs, will your bodily 

systems start shutting down, so it is pegged to 

the urgency of acute care in an emergency room. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So it has to be 

immediate? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The -- the relevant 

standard under the statute is phrased in terms 

of whether these consequences will occur without 

immediate treatment, yes.  So it's focused on 

the interaction between having some kind of

urgent health crisis that takes you to an

 emergency room in the first place and then how

 proximate these -- these consequences are likely

 to be.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there are two

 different things there, whether the person is --

 whether the woman is in immediate jeopardy or

 whether the person -- the woman needs immediate 

care in order to eliminate jeopardy at a later 

point. 

So I understand your answer to be that 

the woman need not be in immediate jeopardy, but 

if she doesn't get care right away, jeopardy at 

some future point may suffice? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So the statutory 

standard itself is focused on immediate health 

risks. It's looking at the possibility that if 

the woman doesn't get treatment then and there, 

what will happen, what will reasonably be 

expected to -- occur is that her organs could 

start shutting down or she might lose her 

fertility or have other serious health 

consequences.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do the terms

 "impairment to bodily functions" or "serious

 dysfunction of any bodily organ or part" refer 

only to permanent impairment or dysfunction?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Or do they -- does it 

also refer to temporary impairment or 

dysfunction? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think it can also 

refer to temporary impairment, but I'm not sure 

that it's easy to parse the two. For example, a 

lot of times a pregnant woman in distress, she 

might start suffering liver damage or kidney 

malfunction, and you don't know ex ante whether 

that's going to be permanent or not.  The 

instruction that Congress gave in EMTALA is you 

need to stabilize to guard against those very 

serious health risks.

 Could the federal government condition 

the receipt of funds on hospitals that they 

comply with medical ethics rules provided for by 

the federal government, a medical malpractice

 regime, and a medical licensing regime such that

 effectively all state medical malpractice laws,

 all state medical licensing laws would be

 preempted? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And you're 

imagining that this is regulatory action or that 

Congress has passed a statute creating kind of a 

federal malpractice regime? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You call it. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I mean, I think --

I have a broad view of Congress's authority to 

enact statutes, and so what I'd want to assess 

in that situation is, you know, whether Congress 

is acting pursuant to one of its enumerated 

powers. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Spending Clause. 

I'm -- I'm -- this is all Spending Clause. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah.  So -- so I 

think that very likely Congress could make those 

kinds of judgments and attach conditions to the

It would obviously be an extreme sanction to --

to terminate Medicare funding, but that is a

JUSTICE GORSUCH: And there's also a 

private right of action for EMTALA violations 

that it have the possibility of equitable relief

 as well?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  Certainly, 

monetary relief and -- and possibly equitable 

relief as well. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In -- in this case, 

you -- you -- you brought an equitable cause of 

action.  You didn't cite any statute to enforce 

EMTALA.  And one of the rules in equity 

traditionally at least is that you don't get an 

equitable relief if there's an adequate remedy 

at law. 

And as we just discussed, there's a 

pretty reticulated statute here.  Seminole Tribe 

says, when you have a reticulated statute and 

lots of remedial options, you don't get 

equitable relief.  Thoughts?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, your

 friend on the other side said that your position

 would require religiously affiliated hospitals 

with emergency rooms to perform abortions. Was

 he right?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. My friend was

 wrong. There are federal conscience protections 

that apply at the entity level to hospitals as

 well. The key provisions are in the Weldon 

Amendment and also Coats-Snowe, although that 

depends on the residency program of a particular 

hospital. 

Now HHS said in a 2008 rulemaking on 

conscience protections that it had never come 

across a hospital that had a blanket objection 

to providing life-preserving and 

health-preserving pregnancy termination care, 

but if a hospital had that kind of objection, 

and HHS recently informed me they still have not 

come across that hospital, that would be honored 

vis-à-vis HHS's enforcement ability. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you 

said that applies at the entity level.  Can 

individual doctors in the emergency room -- do 

they have a conscience exemption?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Oh, yes. Yes. 

They're protected under the church amendments

 principally.  And our position is that EMTALA 

does not override either set of conscience 

protections. So, if an individual doctor has a 

conscience objection to providing pregnancy 

termination, EMTALA itself imposes obligations 

at the entity level, and the hospital should 

have plans in place to honor the individual 

doctor's conscience objection while ensuring 

appropriate staffing for emergency care. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does 

that -- does that mean that there must be 

somebody in the emergency room that can provide 

an abortion?  What if -- what if there are two 

doctors, three doctors, and they all have a 

conscience exemption? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. In that 

circumstance, EMTALA could not override those 

individual doctors' conscience protections, but 

my understanding is that as a matter of best 

practice, because hospitals want to be able to 

provide emergency care, they do things like ask 

doctors to articulate their objections in 

advance so that that can be taken into account

 Hospitals have a lot of plans in place --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- for these kinds

 of contingencies.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. Are --

are you saying that there must be somebody

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The conditions of 

participation for Medicare require hospitals to 

be appropriately staffed to provide emergency 

treatment.  Now, in a situation where a hospital 

doesn't -- hasn't done that and it doesn't have 

anyone on hand who can provide care, you know, 

maybe all of the doctors called in sick that day 

and there's just literally no one in the 

emergency room, or in this case, if everyone had 

a conscience objection, then the hospital would 

not be able to provide the care. But there are 

conditions of participation that are meant to 

ensure that there is good governance of 

hospitals and organization to account --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and the 

consequence of them not being able to provide

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  In that

 circumstance, I think they would likely be out 

of compliance with the conditions of 

participation that require them to be 

appropriately staffed.  But, if the question is 

could you force an individual doctor to step in 

then over a conscience objection, the answer is 

no, and I want to be really clear about that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but 

the question --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We don't understand 

EMTALA to displace it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. 

The question is whether or not they must have 

available someone who can comply the procedures 

required by EMTALA.  And what would be the 

consequence if they didn't?  Would it be 

eventual termination of their participation in 

Medicare?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  So,

 if a hospital was continually disobeying the 

requirement to have in place sufficient

 personnel to run their emergency room, then I 

imagine that HHS would, through enforcement 

action, work with that hospital to try to bring

 it into compliance.  And if the hospital 

ultimately is just leaving itself in a position 

where it can never provide care, then it would 

terminate the Medicare funding agreement. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I thought --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  General --

minute ago -- I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Oh, no, go ahead. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I thought you -- I 

just want to clear -- clarify this colloquy.  I 

thought you said a minute ago, though, if the 

hospital had a conscience objection and 

therefore didn't provide certain care, that that 

wouldn't render it out of compliance.  Which is 

it? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.

 could assert a conscience objection --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's all.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- and EMTALA would

 not override that.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  My question -- I

 have a question about the Hyde Amendment.  So I

 gather from the briefing that there might be 

some situations in which EMTALA would require an

 abortion, but the Hyde Amendment wouldn't permit 

federal funds to be used to pay for it. And you 

said in your brief that EMTALA requires in other 

circumstances as well stabilizing treatment to 

be given that federal funds don't cover. 

Can you give an example of that?  And 

am I right about the Hyde Amendment?  And then 

can you give an example of that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So you are 

right about both things.  It is common under 

EMTALA that hospitals are going to have to 

provide care where there's not federal funding 

available.  And I'll give you an example of a 

Medicare patient who goes in and his emergency 

medical condition means he needs a particular 

drug that's not covered by Medicare benefits. 

Still, the hospital has to provide him with

 stabilizing treatment and give him that 

medication, even though the federal funding 

isn't going to pay for it.

 And that also applies to people who 

are uninsured, who aren't covered by Medicare in

 the first instance.  The -- the whole point of

 EMTALA was it doesn't matter your circumstances,

 it doesn't matter whether you can pay or not, it 

doesn't matter the particulars of your 

situation, this is a guarantee.  You can get 

stabilizing treatment. 

I want to say, though, that I don't 

think there's any inconsistency between the 

lines Congress drew in EMTALA and Hyde. And 

Congress itself has recognized that these 

statutes address discrete issues.  I'm thinking 

here of the provision in the Affordable Care Act 

that was exclusively about abortion, and there, 

Congress said nothing in the ACA displaces Hyde 

and the other -- other federal funding 

restrictions on abortion, but also, nothing in 

the ACA displaces EMTALA's requirement to 

stabilize. 

And that shows two things.  It shows 

first that Congress recognized that stabilizing

care can sometimes be pregnancy termination. 

And I think it also showed Congress's 

recognition that these statutes addressed their

 own distinct spheres.

 And one final point on Hyde, Justice

 Barrett.  My friend isn't drawing a line based 

on Hyde either because his point is, even if a

 woman is on the brink of death and she goes to 

an emergency room and there are federal funds 

available under Hyde to treat her, still, 

hospitals have no obligation under EMTALA to 

provide that care. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So what about the 

colloquy I was having with your friend about 

what stabilizing treatment entails?  Let's 

imagine a situation which a woman is, I don't 

know, 10 weeks, and is told that if you carry 

this pregnancy to term, it could have, you know, 

consequences for your health, but you just would 

need to abort before, like, say, 15 weeks, 

something like that.  So there's not an 

immediacy, like -- so she's stable when she 

leaves the hospital, but in Idaho, there's no

What is the federal government's

 position then?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think, if I'm

 understanding the hypothetical correctly, that 

she likely wouldn't have an emergency medical 

condition in the first place because --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- the definition 

of having an emergency medical condition is 

that, without immediate treatment, you are 

reasonably being -- you will reasonably be 

expected to have serious dysfunction of your 

organs or serious impairment of your bodily 

functions. 

And so, in that situation where a 

woman is somewhat high risk, you know, maybe she 

-- she has certain complications where doctors 

can say there's some danger with continuing this 

pregnancy, I don't think that that creates the 

kind of emergency medical condition that EMTALA 

is aimed at. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Last 

question, and this is about the Spending Clause 

issue. 

So it does seem odd -- and I think

kind of what some of the questions are getting

 at -- it does seem odd that through a side

 agreement between a private entity and the

 federal government, the private entity can get 

out of state law, right?

 So, in another administration, would 

it be possible then in reliance on the spending

 power for Congress to say, you know, any

 hospital that takes these funds cannot perform 

abortions or any hospital -- despite state law 

requiring -- a state constitutional amendment 

requiring abortion to be available, is that 

possible or, you know, with gender reassignment 

surgery?  I mean, you can imagine it kind of 

going back and forth through Spending Clause 

litigation in ways that would be unusual. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, I think 

Congress has broad power under the Spending 

Clause to attach conditions.  Now it doesn't 

mean that it's wholly unlimited.  Obviously, 

Congress would be having to act pursuant to an 

enumerated power, it would have to comply with 

other constitutional limits, and so the law 

would have to be valid.  The Spending Clause 

itself has built-in limits, things like

Congress could prohibit gender reassignment 

surgeries across the nation, it could ban 

abortion across the nation, through the use of 

its Spending Clause authority, right?

I think, if Congress itself is doing it, then 

that provision is inapplicable by its own terms. 

That's looking at the --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You don't think it 

informs our view and understanding of the 

statute in any way?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think, in

 the event of some kind of direct conflict, you

 know, looking at EMTALA in particular, it's the 

later in time enacted statute, and it's clearly 

more specific, so it would control. 

But this Court itself has rejected the 

idea that there would be that kind of conflict. 

And I'm thinking of the CMS vaccine case, where 

the litigants relied on this exact same 

provision of the Medicare Act, Section 1395, and 

this Court said no, that can't bear the weight 

that those litigants could place on it or it 

would call into question all of the conditions 

of participation in Medicare. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do you agree that 

our clear statement rule with respect to 

Spending Clause legislation, our clear statement 

rule with respect to federalism are in play 

here?

took -- I took him to sort of mean that the way 

that Idaho's statute operates, it basically 

allows for a doctor to say, well, in my view,

 you know, this health-threatening circumstance

 could eventually lead to death, and so I'm going

 to do it. So, to the extent that doctors are 

still able to do that, I guess, he's saying

 there's no preemption.

 But is it true that there really isn't 

in operation a difference between the two -- the 

-- the EMTALA and what Idaho has required here? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. That is 

gravely mistaken on three levels.  It's 

inconsistent with the actual text of the Idaho 

law. It's inconsistent with medical reality. 

And it's inconsistent with what's happening on 

the ground. 

And this is a really important point, 

so let me try to unpack this.  On the text 

itself, Idaho's law only allows termination if 

it's "necessary to prevent death."  And that is 

textually very narrow compared to what EMTALA 

requires with the category of harm to begin 

with. In Idaho, doctors have to shut their eyes 

to everything except death, whereas, under

 EMTALA, you're suppose -- supposed to be 

thinking about things like, is she about to lose

 her fertility?  Is her uterus going to become

 incredibly scarred because of the bleeding?  Is 

she about to undergo the possibility of kidney

 failure?  So I think that that is one critical

 distinction. 

The other critical textual distinction

 is the idea of necessity.  Under Idaho law, you 

have to conclude that death will necessarily 

result, which is also materially different, and 

the Idaho Supreme Court specifically recognized 

it. 

Second, with respect to the actual 

medical reality here, there are numerous 

conditions that we are worried about where a 

doctor's immediate concern is not death.  That's 

a far more remote possibility.  They're thinking 

about the health circumstances that EMTALA 

guards against. 

And let me give you two examples.  The 

first is PPROM, premature rupture of the 

membranes.  We have declarations at 594 that

What the doctors explained there --

this is Dr. Fleisher and Dr. Cooper -- is a

 woman comes in with PPROM. Her sac is ruptured. 

There's no chance the fetus is going to be able 

to survive, but at that point, she doesn't have 

active signs of infection, and so, until she

 deteriorates, you can't think she's close to

 death. What you're worried about is she will

 become infected.  She might develop sepsis.  She 

might have these dramatic consequences for her 

future, but it's not about death. So I think 

that is one example where you can't do it. 

And then, finally, just the actual 

practice on the ground, women in Idaho today are 

not getting treatment.  They are getting 

airlifted out of the state to Salt Lake City and 

to neighboring states where there are health 

exceptions in their laws because the doctors are 

facing mandatory minimum two years in prison, 

loss of their license, criminal prosecution. 

The doctors can't provide the care 

because until they can -- can conclude that a 

prosecutor looking over their shoulder won't 

second-guess that maybe it wasn't really 

necessary to prevent death.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 Justice Thomas?

 Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO: We've now heard --

let's see -- an hour and a half of argument on 

this case, and one potentially very important

 phrase in EMTALA has hardly been mentioned.

 Maybe it hasn't even been mentioned at all. And 

that is EMTALA's reference to the woman's 

"unborn child." 

Isn't that an odd phrase to put in a 

statute that imposes a mandate to perform 

abortions?  Have you ever seen an abortion 

statute that uses the phrase "unborn child"? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It's not an odd 

phrase when you look at what Congress was doing 

in 1989.  There were well-publicized cases where 

women were experiencing conditions, their own 

health and life were not in danger, but the 

fetus was in grave distress and hospitals 

weren't treating them. So what Congress did --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, have you seen --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- is that it --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- have you seen

abortion statutes that use the phrase "unborn

 child"?  Doesn't that tell us something?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It tells us that

 Congress wanted to expand the protection for 

pregnant women so that they could get the same 

duties to screen and stabilize when they have a

 condition that's threatening the health and

 well-being of the unborn child.

 But what it doesn't suggest is that 

Congress simultaneously displaced the 

independent preexisting obligation to treat a 

woman who herself is facing grave life and 

health consequences. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's walk 

through the provisions of the statute that are 

relevant to this issue regarding the status and 

the potential interests of an unborn child. 

Under (b)(1), if a woman goes to a 

hospital with an "emergency medical condition" 

-- that's the phrase -- the hospital must either 

stabilize the condition or, under some 

circumstances, transfer the -- the woman to 

another facility. 

So we have this phrase, "emergency 

medical condition," in that provision.  And

 then, under (e)(1), the term -- "emergency

 medical condition" is defined to include a

 condition that places the health of the woman's

 unborn child in serious jeopardy.

 So, in that situation, the hospital 

must stabilize the threat to the unborn child. 

And it seems that the plain meaning is that the 

hospital must try to eliminate any immediate

 threat to the child, but performing an abortion 

is antithetical to that duty. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But, in a 

circumstance --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now -- and you -- you 

go -- you go so far as to say that the statute 

is clear in your favor.  I -- I don't know how 

you can say that in light of the -- of those 

provisions that I've just read to you. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The statute did 

nothing to displace the woman herself as an 

individual with an emergency medical condition 

when her life is in danger, when her health is 

in danger.  That stabilization obligation 

equally runs to her and makes clear that the 

hospital has to give her necessary stabilizing 

treatment.

And in many of the cases you're 

thinking about, there is no possible way to --

to stabilize the unborn child because the fetus

 is sufficiently before viability that it's

 inevitable that the pregnancy is going to be

 lost, but Idaho would deny women treatment in

 that circumstance --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- even though it's 

senseless. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't what I've read 

to you show that the statute imposes on the 

hospital a duty to the woman certainly and also 

a duty to the child?  And it doesn't tell the 

hospital how it is to adjudicate conflicts 

between those interests and it leaves that to 

state law. 

Now maybe a lot -- most of your 

argument today has been dedicated to the 

proposition that the Idaho law is a bad law, and 

that may well be the case.  But what you're 

asking us to do is to construe this statute that 

was enacted back during the Reagan 

Administration and signed by President Reagan to 

mean that there's an obligation under certain

 doing that is a violation of state law.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  If Congress had 

wanted to displace protections for pregnant

 women who are in danger of losing their own 

lives or their health, then it could have

 redefined the statute so that the fetus itself

 is an individual with an emergency medical

 condition.  But that's not how Congress 

structured this.  Instead, it put the protection 

in to expand protection for the pregnant woman. 

The duties still run to her. 

And in a situation where her own life 

and health is gravely endangered, then, in that 

situation, EMTALA is clear.  It says the 

hospital has to offer her stabilizing treatment. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  The -- the only --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And she doesn't 

have to accept it.  These are tragic 

circumstances.  And many women want to do 

whatever they can to save that pregnancy.  But 

the statute protects her and gives her that 

choice.

I just posited is by focusing on the term

 "individual."  And you say, a-ha, in the 

Dictionary Act, "individual" is defined to 

exclude an unborn child or a fetus. That's the 

only way you can try to get out of what I've

 just outlined.

           And isn't it true that under the

 dictionary -- that Dictionary Act definitions 

apply only if they are not inconsistent with the 

statutory text?  And when you have a text that, 

certainly, you wouldn't dispute the fact that 

the hospital has a duty to the unborn child 

where the woman wants to -- wants to have the 

pregnancy go to term, it's indisputably protects 

the interests of the unborn child. So it's 

inconsistent with the definition in the -- in 

the -- in the Dictionary Act. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, not at all. 

The duty runs to the individual with the 

emergency medical condition.  The statute makes 

clear that's the pregnant woman. And, of 

course, Congress wanted to be able to protect 

her in situations where she's suffering some 

kind of emergency and her own health isn't at 

risk, but the fetus might die.

That includes common things like a 

prolapse of the umbilical cord into the cervix,

 where the fetus is in grave distress, but the

 woman is not at all affected.  Hospitals 

otherwise wouldn't have an obligation to treat 

her, and Congress wanted to fix that.

 But to suggest that in doing so 

Congress suggested that the woman herself isn't 

an individual, that she doesn't deserve 

stabilization, I think that that is an erroneous 

reading of this statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, this --

this lack of conflict which your opposing

 colleague says doesn't exist, you mentioned a

 situation where it does.  Why don't you

 succinctly state what you -- what, they admit 

there's daylight.  Tell us exactly how you 

define where the daylight -- daylight exists. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The daylight, as I 

see it, exists on two dimensions.  They think 

that doctors can only provide stabilizing care 

when the woman is facing death. And we think, 

no, you can take into account things like kidney 

failure, the risk of a seizure, and life-long 

neurological impacts based on that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they -- they 

said the recent decision of the Oregon court 

says you don't need death to be imminent or 

immediate, I think, is the word they used if I'm 

not wrong. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So what the Idaho 

Supreme Court said in that decision is that

there's no particular level of imminency and no

 certain percent chance requirement. But what

 the court couldn't do is turn away from the 

language requiring the type of harm to

 exclusively be death.

 And also, the inherent concept of

 necessity requiring some degree of imminence,

 it's true that it's a subjective standard under 

Idaho law, and the court made that clear, but 

what the Idaho Supreme Court also said is 

prosecutors are free to come in and have other 

medical experts second-guess doctors' decisions 

by saying maybe you didn't subjectively think 

she really needed it as necessary to prevent 

death because, look, her -- her sac had 

ruptured, but she wasn't yet infected. 

And that's exactly the kind of 

situation that leads to women being driven out 

of state, dumped on neighboring states by Idaho, 

and criminalizing the care, the essential care 

that they need.

understood it, for example, I read recently that

 the hospital that has the greatest emergency 

room services in Idaho has just in the few 

months that this has been in place had to 

airlift six pregnant women to neighboring 

states, whereas, in the prior year, they did one

 the entire year.

 So, if Mr. Turner is right about what

 the state is trying to convey to hospitals about 

when they'll be prosecuted, like, why is this 

happening? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that the 

reason this is happening is because those 

doctors can look at the text of the statute 

itself, they can look at the Idaho Supreme 

Court's decision, which made clear, very clear, 

that this was a departure from prior Idaho laws 

that tracked EMTALA.  And they can recognize 

that their livelihood is on the line, their 

medical license, their ability to practice 

medicine, their freedom if they have to go to 

jail and serve one of these minimum two-year 

sentences of imprisonment, and they simply 

cannot provide the care, even consistent with 

their subjective medical judgment, because, as a

matter -- matter of medical reality, for many of 

these conditions, it's not yet putting a woman 

at the brink of death or necessary to prevent 

her death, yet they know that the standard of 

care is to provide her with termination because 

she is just going to get worse and worse and

 worse if they wait it out.

 And the other important point about

 this, and I think it goes back to this dual 

stabilization idea, is that, tragically, in many 

of these cases, the pregnancy is lost.  There's 

not going to be any way to save that fetus 

because a woman who has PPROM at 17 weeks, there 

is no medical way to sustain the pregnancy to 

give the fetus a chance.  So, in that situation, 

what Idaho is doing is waiting for women to wait 

and deteriorate and suffer the life-long health 

consequences with no possible upside for the 

fetus. It just stacks tragedy upon tragedy. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And it -- it -- it 

can't be the appropriate -- you know, it's like 

-- it's become -- transfer is the appropriate 

standard of care in Idaho. But it can't be the 

right standard of care to force somebody onto a 

helicopter.

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And it's entirely 

inconsistent with what Congress was trying to do

 in the statute.  You know, one of the primary

 motivators here was to prevent patient dumping. 

The idea was we don't want people to have to go

 somewhere else to get their care.  You go to the 

first emergency room in your state, and they

 have to treat you and stabilize you.

 But this effectively allows states to 

take any particular treatment they don't want 

their hospitals to provide and dump those 

patients out of state.  And it -- you can 

imagine what would happen if every state started 

to take this approach. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  A -- a question on the 

Spending Clause questions that you've been 

asked. I mean, what would -- if you accepted 

some of these theories, what -- what would the 

consequences of something like that be that we 

would have to worry about? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that it 

would call into question any number of federal 

spending statutes that provide funds to private 

parties, and there are a bunch of them. You 

know, there's the Medicare system itself, which

is, of course, a major federal spend -- spending

 program.  There are funds provided under Title

 VI, under Title IX, a lot of federal statutes 

out there that give funds to private parties and 

insist on conditions of compliance with the

 federal funding restrictions.

 And if the Court were to suddenly say 

that can't preempt contrary state law, then I

 think that it would seriously interfere with the 

ability of the federal government to get its 

benefit of the bargain in those spending 

programs. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you mentioned 

before that this question has never been a part 

of this case? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  They 

did not make these arguments in the lower court. 

They briefly referred to the Spending Clause, 

but I don't understand them to have pressed this 

argument specifically.  And so I think that --

the -- the lower courts did not address it. I 

think the district court said in a footnote, 

they briefly refer to it in a footnote of their 

brief, and it's essentially waived.

important consideration in answer to the 

question of what's happening. But Idaho is

 answer on this -- that, as I count it, nine

 conditions that have been identified by the 

government where EMTALA would require that an 

abortion be available, an abortion is available 

under Idaho law.  And that's in the reply brief. 

Now are there other conditions? 

You've ruled out mental health.  Are there other 

conditions you would identify, or are you just 

saying that that's not really happening on the 

ground? I think that's part of your answer, but 

I just want to get a fuller answer on that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It certainly isn't 

happening on the ground.  These are the 

conditions that we're worried about.  And I

Idaho law would permit it is that you just can't 

square it with the text of the statute.

 there were --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- State of Idaho

 is --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I'm sorry.  Keep

 going.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I just wanted 

to say they're not the ultimate authority on 

what the Idaho law means. That's the Idaho 

Supreme Court, of course, and it has addressed 

this issue in the Planned Parenthood case.  And 

I think it's really significant that, in Planned 

Parenthood, the Idaho Supreme Court expressly 

contrasted this statute with other statutes that 

contain health-preserving measures and 

recognized this was a -- a total departure from 

that. The legislature wanted to focus 

exclusively and more narrowly on a "necessary to 

prevent death" exception. 

So I think that -- that that 

essentially means that the Supreme Court of 

Idaho has already touched on this issue, and 

it's no wonder then that doctors who are facing

are tied and they can't provide that care under

 the Idaho law.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If the -- what's

 on page 8 and 9 of the reply -- brief were Idaho

 law, would there be a problem still?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, if we had an

 authoritative Idaho Supreme Court decision that 

said Idaho law allows for termination in the 

circumstances where EMTALA would require it, 

yes, of course.  Then the conflict goes away.

say that because, of course, here --

very important law addressing a very important

who came in for emergency care, and the idea was

 that can't happen.  We can't allow hospitals in 

this country to turn away poor and uninsured

 people in emergencies.

 But their theme is that the law was

 not designed contextually to deal with specific 

-- with abortion or other specific kinds of 

care. And so they make a textual argument, but 

I think they also make a broader contextual 

argument about the whole idea of what was going 

on in 1986.  And I want to make sure -- I don't 

think that's really come up too much.  I want to 

make sure you respond to that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I appreciate having 

the chance to address that.  So, at the outset, 

I don't think they can square that theory with 

the text of the statute, which says in no 

uncertain terms here is the fundamental 

guarantee.  If you have an emergency medical 

condition and you go to an ER in this country, 

they have to stabilize you.  They have to give 

you such treatment as may be necessary within 

reasonable medical probability to ensure that 

you don't deteriorate.

reticulated list of all possible emergency 

medical conditions and all possible treatments, 

but it was very clear that Congress set a 

baseline national standard of care to ensure 

that no matter where you live in this country,

 you can't be declined service and the -- the 

urgent needs of your medical condition

 addressed.

 And, you know, it would be no 

different if the state had come out and decided 

to ban epinephrine.  That's the singular way to 

treat anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. 

That would violate the statute, and we would be 

up here making exactly the same arguments 

because Congress didn't want that.  If you have 

anaphylaxis and you go to an ER anywhere around 

this country, they're going to give you 

epinephrine, and Congress mandated that. 

And I don't see any way to try to draw 

lines around to exclude pregnancy complications 

in the very narrow but tragic circumstances 

where the only way to address the woman's 

condition and prevent material deterioration is 

for the pregnancy to end.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, General, I -- I 

understand the primary difference between EMTALA

 and the Idaho statute to be this health, that --

that Idaho focuses on the risk of life, but the 

federal government says that EMTALA -- well, 

EMTALA says that the health is -- am I right,

 it's health and life? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's -- that's 

the principal difference, but I think it's also 

the difference between "necessary to prevent 

death" versus the health concerns would be 

reasonably expected to occur. So I think that 

that is a standard that builds in a little more 

space for doctors to take action. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Got it.  Is the 

federal government aware of any state other than 

Idaho that has a law that does not take health 

into account? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  There are six other 

states that have severe abortion restrictions 

without a health exception.  So I think that 

those are the primary category of states we're 

concerned about here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  General, Petitioner

 relies pretty heavily on clear statement rule

 principles, and I wonder whether you might

 comment on my thought that those principles 

actually cut against them in this case. 

As you said, Congress set a baseline 

national standard of care.  It has said in no 

uncertain terms that the hospital must provide 

stabilizing care to people experiencing 

emergency medical conditions.  There was no, as 

you've said, you know, particular conditions --

or -- or particular treatments talked about, 

carved out, et cetera. 

So, if a clear statement is required, 

wouldn't it be the requirement of exemption --

of exempting abortion?  I mean, you know, 

Justice Alito has talked about some of the 

references to "unborn child," but none of them 

read like an exemption that I would think our 

clear statement rule would require in a 

circumstance in which the baseline is this clear

national standard of care.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I agree.  I 

think that Congress clearly was requiring 

stabilization and made that an unqualified 

mandate.  It wasn't exempting particular

 conditions or particular type of treatments. 

And, you know, this Court has said that there's 

no canon of donut holes. That was in Bostock,

 that when you have a -- a provision like that, 

the fact that you don't have a specific 

enumeration of one of its applications doesn't 

mean that you should read in some kind of 

implicit exception. 

So I think --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And if we're looking 

for something clear, we would need to see, I 

would think, the clear statement that Congress 

meant for you not to have to provide an abortion 

pursuant to the mandate of providing stabilizing 

care. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think 

it's important to recognize that every relevant 

actor has understood the statute this way from 

the beginning.  They understood Congress's clear 

mandate here.

This has been the agency's position 

all along. We are not adopting a new position. 

That's reflected in our enforcement activity and 

in HHS's guidance and rulemakings in this area.

 Providers have understood it. Even

 those hospitals that don't provide elective

 abortions, they have always provided

 life-sustaining and health-sustaining pregnancy 

termination consistent with EMTALA. 

Congress itself recognized it in the 

Affordable Care Act.  And I don't think there's 

any reasonable argument to be made that people 

misunderstood what Congress was doing in this

was referenced, that's what the Solicitor

 General's office told this Court when it said

 that 1395 does not require -- does not allow 

federal officials to dictate particular

 treatments for particular cases.

 That's exactly what they are trying to 

do here with EMTALA. It's also confirmed by

 subdivision (f).  That in -- that codifies a

 presumption against preemption.  And so, to 

Justice Jackson's colloquy at the end, that is 

the point.  You do presume that state law 

continues to operate alongside EMTALA.  You 

don't presume the opposite. 

It's supported by the CMS operations 

manual, which is HHS's Rosetta Stone of EMTALA 

enforcement.  It tells doctors, it tells CMS 

enforcement agents on the ground that you 

consider what is available by referencing what 

is within the scope of that doctor's license. 

That is exactly what we are saying. 

It is also specifically directed in 42 

C.F.R. 489.11, which requires hospitals to 

assure that their medical staff comply with 

state law. That's a federal regulation that 

directs hospitals to require their hospital

staff to comply with state law.

 It's also confirmed by the 115,000 

enforcement instances that totally lack any 

theory that would support, any case history that

 would support the administration's reading.  She 

says that this has always been understood to be 

the case. Well, you'd think that we would find 

in those 115,000 instances a single example 

where state law was overridden by EMTALA, and 

there isn't one. 

Finally, the text.  It -- the text 

qualifies EMTALA's stabilization requirement by 

the staff that is available.  We know nurses 

can't perform open heart surgery and we know 

janitors can't draw blood.  It's not just a 

plain mandate devoid of reference to state law. 

And we know the word "available" even 

in a common usage incorporates state law.  For 

example, you heard just the other day that when 

considering whether a bed is available for 

homeless people, it has both a physical sense 

and a legal sense.  And whether cigarettes or 

alcohol are available to people in Idaho, there 

is both a physical question and a legal 

question.

Opioids are available in hospitals.

 They are on the shelf.  They are physically 

there. But there is a legal question that comes

 into play too.  It is the same with abortions.

 In response to the Chief Justice's 

question on conscience, General Pre -- Prelogar 

said that both hospitals and doctors are exempt

 from EMTALA's supposed abortion mandate.  We're 

relieved to hear that. But I think that it 

highlights the utter inconsistency of the 

administration's reading. 

So, if EMTALA's stabilization 

requirement is general enough not to override 

extra-textual protections like conscience 

protections, then it cannot be so specific and 

include a requirement that is in direct conflict 

with state law.  Those two don't jibe. 

This Court does not lightly find a 

direct conflict.  Congress must speak clearly. 

It has not done so here. 

The administration's position 

ultimately is untethered from any limiting 

principle. I think we heard that. There's just 

no way to limit this to abortion.  And there's 

no way to limit it to Idaho.  I'm -- there are

22 states with abortion laws on the books. This 

isn't going to end with Idaho. It's not going 

to end with the six states that General Prelogar 

mentioned because all of the states that have

 abortion regulations define the health and the 

emergency exception narrower than EMTALA does. 

So this question is going to come up in state

 after state after state.

 It's also not limited to physical 

health.  I know General Prelogar says that 

there's no circumstance in which a health -- a 

mental health condition would require 

stabilization with an abortion, but now she's 

just fighting with the American Psychiatric 

Association, the very standards that she's 

setting up to say controls the EMTALA inquiry. 

That's not consistent, and it isn't limited to 

-- limited to EMTALA. 

Justice Thomas, Alito, Justice 

Gorsuch, you all pointed out the major Spending 

Clause implications that are at play here.  And 

I disagree that we didn't brief this.  It's on 

pages 20 to 21 of our opening brief.  We 

recognize that this is hugely concerning if the 

federal government can pay private actors to

 state criminal laws.  The implications of that

 General Prelogar admitted that.
