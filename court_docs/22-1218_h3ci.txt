 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-1218, Smith versus

 Spizzirri.

 Mr. Geyser.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Section 3 unambiguously mandates a 

stay pending arbitration, and the FAA's plain 

text, structure, and purpose confirm that 

conclusion.  Congress directed that a court 

shall stay the trial of the action until the 

arbitration is complete.  There is no mention of 

dismissal, and there are no exceptions for cases 

where all claims are subject to arbitration. 

If a court ignores that command and 

dismisses, it activates a premature right to 

appeal, contrary to the FAA's reticulated 

scheme.  It illuminates the essential backdrop 

that protects litigant rights if a party compels 

arbitration but abandons the arbitration 

process, which has happened in this very case.

And, critically, it invites wasteful disputes 

that pointlessly burden parties and courts as 

litigants fight over whether to stay or dismiss

 and then take appeals over whether to stay or

 dismiss.

 A bright-line rule answers that 

procedural question in a manner that best

 preserves judicial and party resources and 

directly advances the core purpose of the FAA 

itself, eliminating waste, avoiding unnecessary 

litigation, and sending parties to arbitration 

as quickly as possible. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Geyser, what 

difference does it make to grant a stay here or 

dismissal without prejudice? 

MR. GEYSER: Well, it -- it makes a 

big difference whether we have a seat to come 

back to.  The arbitration has now failed.  The 

Respondents have not paid their fees.  Our --

our clients will have to file new suits, engage 

in new service, do new case-initiating 

documents, and waste our time and the court's 

time. 

We also face a situation where

Respondents could then move to compel

 arbitration again and further --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But aren't you also

 encouraging people to start out in federal

 court?

 MR. GEYSER: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. That hasn't been a problem in any of the 

six circuits that have adopted the majority rule 

now for quite some time. Even if a party did 

file a suit in the hopes of anchoring federal 

jurisdiction, the court could always decline to 

exercise supplemental jurisdiction and not 

decide any of the FAA motions, which would 

render the entire practice a waste of time. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Has there been a 

problem of, when cases have been dismissed 

without prejudice, to get back into federal 

court? 

MR. GEYSER: There are sometimes 

limitations problems, which you can see both in 

the Green decision from the Eighth Circuit and 

Anderson in the Sixth Circuit. 

But I -- I think the more important 

point is not even the cases that can't come 

back; it's the very waste of time and resources

 litigating whether to stay or dismiss when it's

 such a one-sided bargain. 

This -- there are over 800 contested

 arbitration matters every single year.  There --

there's very little upside to saying, in every 

one of those cases, whenever anyone disagrees

 about whether to stay or dismiss, the parties 

should brief that question, the court should

 waste its resources deciding it, the losing 

party could take an appeal, instead of just 

saying, as a categorical matter, let's follow 

what the statute actually says. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, you talk about 

what the statute actually says.  It says stay 

the trial.  And Respondent makes a lot of that. 

So what is your response to that argument? 

MR. GEYSER: I think we have a few 

responses.  The first is this is the trial that 

would happen if there isn't an arbitration.  So 

it's staying the trial of the action.  This is 

trying the case, staying the merits 

adjudication, so that the parties can effectuate 

the arbitration agreement. 

The other thing I would say is that 

when my -- my friend suggests that there won't

be a trial because the case is subject to 

arbitration, that's inherently speculative.

 There are lots of examples where a court compels 

arbitration and the parties return to court 

either because there's a delegation clause and 

it turns out the whole dispute isn't subject to

 arbitration, you can have the plaintiff not 

initiating the arbitration, you can have the

 defendant not paying the arbitration fees, which 

is what happened --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But you would -- you 

would have an easier case if it said stay the 

proceeding or stay the action.  I mean, the --

the statute is using the word "trial."  You want 

us to interpret it to be proceeding or action, 

but that's not exactly what it says. 

MR. GEYSER: Well, for -- for what 

it's worth, the -- the title, which is actually 

a part of what Congress inserted into the United 

States Code in 1947, does say "stay of 

proceedings."  So Congress has always understood 

this to be staying the proceedings, the merits 

adjudication.

known for being the world's most precisely

 Congress here could have used that language for

 a particular reason.  If you stay the entire 

case, it's not clear the court would have 

jurisdiction because, remember, it's staying the

 case until the arbitration is over.  It's not

 clear the court would have jurisdiction to 

entertain motions under the FAA that would

 facilitate the arbitration. 

So let's say the parties have trouble 

appointing an arbitrator.  Could the court then 

lift the stay to decide that motion?  It's not 

clear. But, if Congress is simply saying stay 

the trial of the action, that's staying trying 

the action, staying the merits adjudication. 

That leaves the courts, you know, available to 

decide these other motions under the Federal 

Arbitration Act. 

And just --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would a district 

court -- under Badgerow, could it dismiss rather

 In that situation, if the arbitration

 fails, you have to go sue in state court, 

correct? You can't stay in federal court

 anyway?

 MR. GEYSER: I -- I just -- I want to 

make sure that I'm answering the -- the question

 correctly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mm-hmm. 

MR. GEYSER: -- so please -- please 

correct me if I'm not. You're dealing here with 

a situation under Section 3.  So there's already 

a preexisting suit in federal court where there 

is federal jurisdiction. 

Now, if a court concludes that there 

never should be any case in federal court, the 

underlying case on the merits is a state law 

dispute between non-diverse parties, the court 

would dismiss.  It wouldn't compel arbitration. 

It has no jurisdiction to do anything. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. 

MR. GEYSER: But -- but, if the court 

has jurisdiction at the outset, then Section 3 

says this is the proper remedy for enforcing the 

parties' arbitration agreement.  Do the stay.

Once arbitration has been had in accordance with 

the agreement, then the court would have the 

option to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and

 decide the case going forward under the -- the

 post-arbitration motions, or it could dismiss 

and say go to state court, enforce, you know,

 the -- the arbitration award in some other

 venue.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Thank you. 

MR. GEYSER: I -- I think just -- you 

know, I -- I hate to belabor it. My -- my 

friends just -- I think one of their stronger 

arguments is they try to suggest that there's 

inherent authority for a court to decide what to 

do when you have an arbitration agreement.  I 

think that fails for multiple reasons. 

It first fails in its premise because 

there is no inherent authority of the kind that 

this Court has recognized as being the sort of 

timeless power that courts have in order to 

function as courts.  This is effectively a 

substantive rule of decision.  It's saying this 

is the procedure that a court should apply in 

deciding how to process an arbitration motion 

and enforce it in court. Even if there were

some inherent authority, it's obviously been 

overridden by what we consider to be the fairly 

unambiguous language of the statute.

 Just one last point to Justice

 Jackson's question at the outset, my friends did 

suggest in their brief in opposition that

 "trial" really just meant trial, as in like the

 fact-finding event. It didn't state anything

 else. That, of course, is absolutely 

incompatible with the entire purpose of the 

Federal Arbitration Act. 

That would say that courts could 

actually entertain motions to dismiss, summary 

judgment motions.  You could have court-based 

discovery.  You could have everything as long as 

the court at the very last minute stops before 

empaneling a jury. We don't think that's a 

plausible reading of the act.

 point about the trial.  I mean, I don't -- I

 never filed a complaint where I didn't want a 

trial. And that was the whole reason why I

 filed the complaint.

 But, on the inherent power, what about 

the district court's authority to dismiss a case 

for abusive litigation tactics, for example?

 Does this prevent that?

 MR. GEYSER: Absolutely not. So all 

Section 3 does is say, if the operative fact is 

I found that any issue in the case is subject to 

arbitration, what do I do? That doesn't 

preclude the court's ability to access any other 

source of federal law that would let it do 

anything else in the case.

you.

designed to prevent wasteful litigation among --

wasteful for multiple reasons, including, first 

and foremost, it's -- it's very little waste at

 all. It's just an inactive case.  The court can

 have a status report.  It can be a sentence

 long. The case is still pending in arbitration,

 the stay should remain in effect.

 It's -- it's hard to imagine how --

what kind of burden that would impose. And it 

saves waste in multiple ways. The first is that 

if the arbitration does fail, then the parties 

are coming back to the same court filing a new 

complaint.  They're doing new service, new 

case-initiating documents, they're spending a 

lot more of the court's time. 

It also would invite the court again, 

as I said at the outset, to decide in each case, 

on a case-by-case basis, should I stay or 

dismiss.  That is an enormous and wasteful use 

of the court's time that will overwhelm whatever 

minor savings a district court might have in not 

having to read a status report every so often. 

And the final point I'd raise is that 

it would also avoid the premature appeals.  If 

you dismiss, if a court dismisses, that 

activates unintended finality.  At that point,

 invite and breed even more litigation, as this

it's every six months, just saying just let us 

know when you're done. 

Other courts will move it to inactive 

status.  So it's still pending on the court's

appeal that shouldn't happen yet, and the

potentially limitations questions, possible

JUSTICE ALITO:  What would your

 argument -- what would your argument look like 

if there were no Section 16?  So neither party 

had the right to an interlocutory appeal. 

MR. GEYSER: I think we'd have one 

fewer arrow in our quiver, but I think our 

argument would otherwise be identical.  I think 

Section 16 makes it -- our -- our job a lot 

easier because this Court does read sections in 

context. 

And when you have Section 16 and 

Congress saying specifically, you can take that 

immediate appeal if the court denies arbitration 

but not if they grant arbitration and subject to 

1292(b), so Congress was even thinking there 

could be exceptions, but if you dismiss, then 

you have an immediate appeal because the case is 

final.

It's -- there's no second gateway with 

an appellate court deciding to accept a 1292(b)

 appeal.  You don't have to meet any of those

 conditions.  So I think it's really hard to 

understand how dismissal is consistent with 

Section 16. But, even without that, we have our

 plain text reading and we have all the other 

points that we've suggested are in our favor.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Counsel, what you've 

said that one of the reasons why stay is 

preferable to dismiss is that the court could 

then sort of continue to help out with certain 

administrative matters operating in the 

background when the arbitration is happening, 

like the appointment of an arbitrator under 

Section 5 or compelling witnesses under Section 

7. 

As I read the Respondents' response, 

they point to Badgerow and say that, well, there 

might need to be an independent jurisdictional 

basis for the court to continue to operate in 

that fashion.  Is that how you read Badgerow 

with respect to those kinds of tasks? 

MR. GEYSER:  Not at all.  Badgerow 

involved a case where there -- there was no

 litigation in federal court.  There was an

 arbitration and then there was a freestanding 

lawsuit filed simply to confirm or to vacate the

 arbitration award.

 In this case, there is preexisting

 jurisdiction.  You don't -- you don't need more

 jurisdiction or extra jurisdiction.  Once a

 court has power to decide the case, they can

 decide the case. 

And at that point, as this Court said 

in Cortez Byrd, once there is a suit and it's 

been stayed under Section 3, the Court then has 

the power on the back end. 

Now, granted, it's -- it's in the 

court's discretion, it's supplemental 

jurisdiction at that point to decide whether to 

engage in any of those other motions, but we 

don't see any inconsistency with Badgerow and, 

in fact --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What about 

confirmation?  Is that the same kind of thing? 

Would you think that the parties in a case like 

this, if it were stayed, could come back to this 

same court to seek confirmation of the -- any 

award that was issued?

 What would happen there?

 the parties realistically -- in reality would

 come back and say, actually, we would like a

 I -- if the -- if the party hasn't

I think is the best practice, when the other 

side says we move to compel, in the answer to 

the motion to compel, if you want a stay, you 

should say and we would like a stay. That way, 

you avoid that scenario. 

But -- but, technically, if the court

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 When Congress directed courts to stay

 the trial of a case in deference to arbitration, 

it meant stop the litigation in court. It did 

not mean you must retain jurisdiction. It did 

not mean never dismiss, no matter how clear it 

is that the case will never come back to court. 

I get that modern lawyers often think 

of stays and dismissals as two completely 

distinct animals, but when Congress passed 

Section 3 a hundred years ago, Congress would 

not have drawn that stark a distinction.  The 

drafters would have understood that a dismissal 

was one way to stay a litigation. 

When Congress intended that a court 

retain jurisdiction, it used those words in 

Section 8. Even if that is not the best 

understanding, this Court should accept it as 

long as it's plausible.  Courts generally have 

the discretion to dismiss cases without 

prejudice when no one is asking them to do

 anything here and now and when another forum is

 actively adjudicating the case.

 If Congress wants to revoke that 

inherent power, it's got to do it clearly, and 

as Mr. Geyser said, Congress did nothing clearly 

in this statute. Congress did not issue such a

 clear direction.  Congress does not even mention

 requiring ongoing jurisdiction.  It does not

 even prohibit dismissing. 

Congress passed Section 3 to enforce 

contractual obligations to arbitrate and to 

avoid parallel litigation in court, not to 

encourage parallel litigation and reward 

plaintiffs who violate their contracts by suing 

in court. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Can you give another 

example of this continuing discretion when you 

have language similar to Section 3 that gives 

the part -- that makes it clear that a stay is 

to be granted? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, let 

me -- I -- I quibble with the second half, that 

it makes it clear that a stay is to be granted.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what's unclear

 about it?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, so when

 Congress used the word "stay" back in 1925, it

 meant that it was requiring courts to stop the

 litigation, and it understood that courts could 

achieve it by either retaining jurisdiction over

 the case and putting it on ice or by dismissing

 it with -- without prejudice to come back if 

there's ever something for the court to do. 

In 1925, the word "stay" was just not 

categorically inconsistent with a dismissal. 

The lead definition of "stay" in Black's Law 

Dictionary at the time was "stopping."  The act 

of arresting what?  Arresting a judicial 

proceeding.  Another said that a stay of the 

action could include a total discontinuance. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, putting 

aside that the title says "stay of proceedings" 

and Black's Law Dictionary makes clear that 

that's different from dismissal -- I'm going to 

put that aside. 

Can't put aside the language which 

says "stay until such arbitration has been had 

in accordance with the terms of the agreement,"

and so it's putting a limit. And it also says

 "providing that the applicant for the stay is 

not in default in proceeding when such" -- when 

the application is made, the district court

-- both the durational limitation and the

 proviso.  They're two separate pieces.

 "Until" simply means how long the 

litigation has to stop. If the court has

 dismissed without prejudice, the durational 

language dictates when the case can return to

 court. The durational language was also 

necessary to establish that any non-arbitrable 

claims which cannot be dismissed may be 

litigated in court when the arbitration is over. 

But Section 3 is not a command to the 

court to retain jurisdiction for the duration of 

the arbitration.  It does not say you must 

retain jurisdiction. 

When Congress wanted courts to retain 

jurisdiction, as it did in Section 8, it said 

"retain jurisdiction," and it would not have 

needed to say "retain jurisdiction" in Section 8 

if Section 3 already required the court to 

retain jurisdiction. 

As to the proviso that a stay 

applicant not be in default, that makes perfect 

sense on our reading also.  If a plaintiff 

starts by filing an arbitration proceeding, 

that's the first thing, the defendant then

its opinion if it's in favor of the Petitioners.

 They will say exactly what Justice Thomas said 

in his very first question. Never ever file an

 arbitration first.  Start in court, preferably 

in federal court because, when you're there, the 

court will be a helicopter parent for as long as 

you want it. Don't worry if there's zero basis 

for you to even resist arbitration.

the flip side of that is it's a much greater 

burden if the case isn't there and something 

arises where you need to go to court. You're 

going to have to start all over. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So, Your Honor, two 

-- two observations about that.  First is the 

burden on the district court in just having the 

case sitting there.  There are a hundred 

thousand arbitrations a year.  Mr. Geyser refers 

to only 800 of them that ever come back to court 

because they are contested.

 report on them.  It has to hold status

 conferences, possibly for years. And think

 about it from the perspective of these district

 courts.  I know it's easy to say what's the big

 deal, just hold a status conference.  But there

 are courts that are in dire circumstances.  They

 are overwhelmed.  They are in emergency --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is there a rule that 

the district court has to hold a status 

conference?  I was not aware of that. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, there's not a

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  The court does not 

have to hold in-person status conferences. 

That's -- that is correct. But simply having to 

keep track of all of these cases, in some 

federal courts, there's no such thing as

answer the second half of the Chief Justice's 

question, the flip side is, okay, so a party has

 to -- if it ever needs further judicial 

intervention, the party has to file a new

 action.

 It's a streamlined process.  It almost

 never happens.  Courts almost never need to

 intervene to appoint an arbitrator or to compel

 a witness.  Mr. Geyser points out a very -- very 

tiny proportion of these arbitrations are even 

ever contested, and they may not even be 

contested in the same court.  So it is needless 

activity. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But don't parties 

often seek confirmation of arbitration awards? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  It's 

very rare.  If the -- if the party on the other 

side is going to pay the judgment, for example, 

or if the defendant has won, no one really seeks 

confirmation --

defendant has won, but let's say we have a

 My question is, isn't that a situation

 for confirmation?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Hypothetically could,

dismissed, they would have to actually file a 

new action with the fee and everything else to 

open up that case to -- which they, by the way, 

thought should have been in court to begin with 

because, in -- in my hypothetical, that's where 

they brought it originally.  Why isn't that more 

burdensome for the overall system than to just 

allow the district court to put this on a list 

somewhere and, if the plaintiff wins, be able to 

entertain a motion for confirmation?

 situation could seek confirmation.  It is very 

rare because defendants almost never challenge

 the judgment in the first place. So no one ever

 seeks confirmation.  The case is sitting there 

without any need ever to come back to the

 district court. 

The second answer is filing a new 

action, it sounds like it's such a big deal, but

 there's a streamlined process.  It is not that 

much of a burden. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  You have to pay, 

don't you? I mean, you'd have to file a new 

action.  With -- like, we paid -- the plaintiff

 constant and -- and repeated reports, but we're

 We're basing -- we're basing our argument on the

 language of the statute.

 And -- and a century ago, lawyers --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And just -- just 

before you get back to the language, I mean, 

mightn't the statute of limitations have run if 

you have to file a new action, but the statute 

of limitations has run in the meantime?  There's 

no tolling of the statute of limitations in the 

circumstance that you're talking about, is 

there? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  There can be in some 

jurisdictions, but there's an easy solution to 

that. If a party wants to oppose a stay on the 

ground that there is a statute of limitations 

problem, they just raise that as a basis for the 

district court to deny dismissal, and -- and the 

district court can consider that or it can 

condition dismissal.

sometimes I should dismiss; sometimes I

 shouldn't dismiss.  I have to go figure out what 

the statute of limitations consequences are.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, look at 

-- look at the papers before the district court 

on this case when the parties were fighting 

about or arguing about stay versus dismissal. 

It was three paragraphs in their response brief 

in response to our motion to dismiss and two 

paragraphs in our response brief. 

I -- I'll give you the page numbers. 

It's 97 to 98 in their response brief and 103 to 

104. It's not that complicated. 

But Petitioners are trying to cram a 

lot of meaning into the word "stay." They say 

it means stop the litigation and continue to 

exercise jurisdiction and don't dismiss, 

regardless of how unlikely it is that anyone is 

ever come -- going to come back to the -- to 

court. 

The -- the word "stay" does not carry 

all of that meaning.  When Congress wanted to 

communicate don't -- wanted to communicate that 

the court must retain jurisdiction, that's what

it said.  That's -- it -- it said retain 

jurisdiction, which is what it said in Section

 8.

 I would also underscore there's 

another reason to read the statute our way. 

Section 4, a plaintiff can bring an action in 

the first instance, as I was saying earlier, 

under Section 4, seeking an order directing the

 court to compel arbitration when the defendant 

has refused to engage in arbitration. 

But Congress never said that the court 

has to retain jurisdiction in that circumstance. 

And the norm in that circumstance is that the 

district court dismisses after ordering 

arbitration because that's the only thing it's 

been asked to do. 

Now, if it was so important for 

Congress to make sure that parties never appeal 

a -- a dismissal -- excuse me -- never appeal an 

order to arbitrate while the arbitration is 

going on, if it's so important to Congress that 

federal courts retain jurisdiction while an 

arbitration is going on, it would have applied 

the same rule to Section 4, but it didn't. 

I was saying earlier that even if the

is better, they cannot avoid the language of the 

statute or the ambiguity -- excuse me, they 

cannot avoid the result that we're arguing if 

the statute is ambiguity -- is -- is ambiguous.

 Any doubt has to be resolved in favor 

of maintaining the district court's traditional

 discretion to dismiss cases when appropriate and

 preserving the backdrop -- the backdrop common 

law in which courts routinely dismissed in 

deference to arbitration. 

When parties have nothing that they 

want the court to do here and now, a court has 

the power to dismiss, without prejudice, but to 

dismiss, in the interest of controlling its own 

docket and maximizing efficiencies for the court 

and all of the parties. 

Courts also routinely dismiss without 

prejudice when the parties are litigating a case 

before another forum, for example, when an 

agency is considering an important issue or a 

foreign court.  The rules are especially salient 

in the arbitration context because, as I was 

saying earlier, the overwhelming likelihood is 

that this case is never coming back to any court

the answer to your question, Your Honor, is that

 "until" still works under our reading because I

 was -- as I was saying earlier, "until" simply

 indicates how long the litigation has to stop 

for and the party can come back to the court

 when --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, I understand.

 Thank you.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I thought "until" 

goes to the verb "stay"?  "Stay until." 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right.  And if you 

read the word stop -- the -- the word "stay" to 

mean "stop," which could entail a dismissal, you 

have to stop it until the arbitration is 

completed. 

And at that point, the court no longer 

has to stop it, so when it was dismissed without 

prejudice, the party can come back to the court 

and the stay provision no longer applies. 

And let me just say one last thing, 

which is that this Court should also read 

Section 3 in light of the problem that Congress 

was trying to solve with Section 3.  It was the 

problem that too many courts were not honoring 

arbitration obligations and were not stopping

the litigation when parties violated their 

arbitration agreements and brought their claims

 in court.

 There's no reason to believe that 

Congress wanted to address that problem by 

requiring courts to hold on to lawsuits 

unnecessarily, much less by requiring courts to 

hold on to them in order to reward plaintiffs 

like Petitioners who violated their contractual 

obligations to go to arbitration instead of 

court. 

Just to sum up, this Court is not 

deciding and we're not asking the Court to 

decide what "stay" means in all contexts and for 

all time.  And I'm -- all I'm saying here is 

that context matters. 

In the context of the Federal 

Arbitration Act passed a century ago, Congress 

was trying to solve a specific problem that

retain jurisdiction when that's what it meant.

 All of this supports our position that 

"stay" means "stop" under Section 3, but at a 

minimum, the alternative reading is not as clear 

as my friend on the other side suggests and it's 

not enough to overcome both the prevailing 

common law practice and the court's inherent 

power to dismiss cases with prejudice when 

another forum is addressing the dispute and none 

of the parties have anything for the court to do 

here and now. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On your point 

about Congress's overall objective, if it's 

dismissed rather than stayed, then that opens up 

the interlocutory appellate right.  Would --

would Congress have wanted that? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So, Your Honor, a --

a couple of things to -- to say about that. 

First, it is simply not true that the 

FAA generally postpones appellate review of 

orders to arbitrate until after the arbitration. 

I was giving the example of a case that begins 

in arbitration and the defendant refuses to 

arbitrate.  What happens next?  There is an 

action under Section 4, and that is an action

that asks for only one thing, which is to compel

 arbitration.  When that order is granted, the 

case is routinely dismissed and the appeal will

 follow.  So it is -- it is simply not true that 

there is a grand congressional design not to

 allow appeals of orders granting arbitration.

 In any event, this Court has already 

rejected Petitioners' argument about the effect

 of Section 16(b) in Green Tree.  That case 

explains that 16(b) is about interlocutory 

appeals, which is obviously where Congress was 

anticipating that a court would stay but did --

was not saying that the court has to stay.  The 

court still has the discretion. 

Nothing in that section bars an appeal 

of a final order, which is what a dismissal is. 

And the last thing I'd say about that is that I 

know one reads a statute as a whole, but we have 

to bear in mind that Congress used the phrase 

"stay the trial of the action," it wrote it in 

1925. Section 16 was passed 60 years later. 

It is highly unlikely that Congress 

intended Section 16 to affect the interpretation 

of Section 3. And what -- I would also say that 

Congress acknowledged in its Senate summary that

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GEYSER: I'll -- I'll be -- I'll 

be brief.  My friend says that we're cramming a 

lot of meaning into the word "stay." We're just 

saying that "stay" means "stay." 

At the time in 1925, if you look to 

Black's Law Dictionary, "stay" was a stay of 

proceedings, which is what this is, was defined 

as a -- as a temporary suspension of the case. 

It's exactly what Section 3 is doing. 

My friend says there are other 

dictionaries that say total discontinuance. 

He's referring to the Dictionary of American and 

English Law.  That's a second diction -- that's 

the second definition of "stay." The first 

definition was a temporary suspension, again, 

exactly what "stay" always means.

I think, if this Court tried to stay a

 lower court order and the lower court turned

 around and dismissed the case, I think the Court

 would be fairly surprised.  It's just not a 

consistent understanding of what "stay" means.

 Justice Sotomayor is exactly right 

that the definition of "stay" meaning suddenly

 dismissed is inconsistent with the surrounding

 clauses.  Justice Jackson is also correct that 

it's inconsistent with the proviso at the very 

end of Section 3 that shows that Congress itself 

contemplated that cases could come back to court 

because arbitrations do sometimes fail. 

Sometimes parties are in default. 

My friend pointed to the difference 

between Section 4 and Section 3 and said that 

you can take an immediate appeal when a Section 

4 petition is granted and dismissed.  That's 

because there's no alternative. 

What -- when else can you take that 

appeal? You'd have to craft an entire new 

appellate scheme.  When -- when would you take 

the appeal from 30 days from what event?  Where 

would you file the notice of appeal? 

You know, if there's no longer a court

case, I don't know where -- you go to the 

district court to file the notice of appeal. 

Congress looked at that and said no statute 

pursues its purpose at all costs. We can't have

 unreviewable district court orders compelling 

arbitration, so in that context where there

 isn't a preexisting, freestanding suit, we will

 allow the immediate appeal.

 In terms of wasting time, it is 

inherently speculative to say some cases are --

are unlikely to come back, some cases are likely 

to come back.  Will there be a tolling problem? 

Will there not be a tolling problem? Those are 

exactly the kind of issues that are pointless 

for courts and parties to debate. 

It's much easier to say let's just 

stay it.  It's exactly correct, as multiple 

members of the Court has recognized, you 

maintain a list.  This Court will maintain cases 

that are contemplating settlement on the -- on 

its petition stage docket.  I don't believe it's 

overwhelming the Court to do that. 

It's not overwhelming district courts, 

who can truly say, just let us know whenever the 

arbitration is finished.  If you do look at the
