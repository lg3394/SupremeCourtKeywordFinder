 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument next in Case 23-21, Harrow versus the

 Department of Defense.

 Mr. Davis.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA P. DAVIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Over the past 20 years or so, this 

Court has clarified the law to prevent ordinary 

procedural rules like filing deadlines from 

being misinterpreted as jurisdictional, contrary 

to congressional intent.  The clear statement 

rule governs that analysis.  That rule demands a 

clear statement from Congress on par with 

explicit language to establish a jurisdictional 

requirement. 

At issue here is whether 5 U.S.C. 

Section 7703(b)(1)(A)'s filing deadline is 

jurisdictional.  Nothing in the text of 

(b)(1)(A) suggests that it is. That can end the 

inquiry.  That conclusion is confirmed by the 

text of the relevant jurisdictional statute, 28

U.S.C. Section 1295(a).  As relevant here, 

Section 1295(a)(9) creates jurisdiction in the

 Federal Circuit over appeals "pursuant to"

 Section 7703(b)(1).

 "Pursuant to" is a notoriously

 ambiguous phrase.  Nevertheless, the government 

claims that the only plausible interpretation of

 "pursuant to" is as necessitating that all the

 requirements of (b)(1)(A) are satisfied. 

But "pursuant to" can mean invoking 

(b)(1), not satisfying its filing deadline. 

That is how this Court interpreted interlocutory 

appellate jurisdiction in -- in removal cases in 

BP P.L.C. in 2021.  It held that "pursuant to" 

means invoking a particular statutory provision, 

not satisfying its requirements. 

Using this compelling interpretation 

or a similar one, (b)(1)(A)'s filing deadline is 

not jurisdictional.  That interpretation is at 

least plausible.  So, under the clear statement 

rule, (b)(1)(A)'s filing deadline is a mere 

claims processing rule. 

I would welcome any questions from the 

Court.

provision, why isn't it -- 7703, why isn't this

 controlled by Lindahl?

 MR. DAVIS: It's not controlled by

 Lindahl for a few reasons.  One, Lindahl did not 

specifically address at all the filing deadline

 provision.  It spoke only in loose

 jurisdictional terms.  And so -- and this Court, 

in Wilkins and Santos-Zacaria, has asked for a

 much more specific ruling in order for the -- an 

inference that the clear statement rule is -- is 

satisfied. 

In addition, Lindahl didn't impose a 

jurisdictional requirement at all.  It actually 

read the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit 

broadly.  It interpreted the relevant statute to 

say that not only the employees and applicants 

for employment are able to bring claims under 

7703(b)(1)(A), but so are retirees, even though 

they're not mentioned explicitly. 

So, 1985, Lindahl is not -- it doesn't 

specifically address this provision or a filing 

deadline whatsoever.  And, in -- in addition, it 

is the sort of loose jurisdictional language 

that the clear statement rule is designed to 

clean up.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know

 that one area where jurisdiction is enforced 

rigorously is from one level of a court to 

another, right, from the district court to a

 court of appeals.  Why does it -- it make sense

 to have a totally different rule when it's from

 an agency to the court of appeals?

 MR. DAVIS: A couple -- a couple of

 reasons.  First of all, in Bowles, the reason 

that the Court adopted this approach was a long 

history of this type of notice of appeal from an 

Article III court to an Article III court. Now 

this Court has repeatedly said that Bowles and 

that general rule should not be read beyond the 

Article III to Article III context, including in 

Hamer and in Fort Bend -- Fort Bend County. 

And then, more generally, it's --

there's not only a different statute at play 

here, one of much more recent vintage, but also 

there's a very different jurisdictional posture. 

One of the things this Court has said repeatedly 

in interpreting filing deadlines and other 

potentially jurisdictional provisions is to look 

at the nature of the litigation process that 

it's coming from.

And the MSPB process, much like this

 Court -- like the veterans approach in Henderson 

or like the adversarial approach in -- for the 

IRS in Boechler, is a much more lenient 

approach. It is adversarial, but it is not in 

the same way that an Article III litigation is. 

And so context is important here.

 And given that context and also the 

precedential reading of the clear statement 

rule, I would submit that the clear statement 

rule should apply kind of ab initio here, and 

then the burden is on the government to show 

that the only plausible reading --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's no history 

that you can point to where Congress has always 

spoken in jurisdictional terms of an agency 

appealing to an Article III court, correct? 

MR. DAVIS: That's -- that's -- that's 

precisely right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And, in fact, 

there are some statutes that clearly on their 

face provide for equitable tolling in that 

situation?

-- one other argument the government raised was 

that courts of appeals are ill suited to handle 

the factual basis of this kind of finding.

 Do you agree with that argument and,

 if you don't, why not? 

MR. DAVIS: I -- I don't agree with 

that argument.  And if I may say first of --

first, before that, that argument conflates two 

separate issues.  One is whether this 

requirement is jurisdictional, and the other is 

whether it's mandatory. 

And so it is at least possible -- the 

only issue before this Court today is, is the 

filing deadline jurisdictional.  But this Court 

could or the lower court would be in the first 

instance the right place to -- to address it, is 

if the lower court feels that it -- the -- that 

having a filing deadline subject to equitable 

tolling is not appropriate, it could say that 

the -- that the filing deadline is not 

jurisdictional but also is mandatory and not 

subject to -- equitable tolling.

Having said that, to answer Your 

Honor's question more directly, we don't agree 

for a series of reasons. I mean, one of them is 

that appellate courts often engage in similar

 kinds of limited factual inquiries.  Standing is

 an example.  So is Federal Rule of Civil

 Procedure 23, where an appellate court is asked

 whether class certification would ring the death

 knell for litigation. 

These are kinds of narrowly 

constrained procedural questions that a court is 

fully able to handle and an appellate court is 

fully able to handle.  And so it would be the 

same thing here. The facts are not actually all 

that disputed.  They're relatively narrow. 

Here, the real question is a legal 

judgment, and that is the kind of legal judgment 

a -- a court of appeals is -- is fully capable 

of making. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We look at facts 

in mootness, in standing, the statutes that give 

us directly equitable tolling permission.  The 

one thing about a mandatory claim processing is 

that it can't be sua sponte decided by a court 

below. It has to be raised by the opposing

 MR. DAVIS: I believe that's generally

 correct.  That's right, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And was that the

 case here?

 MR. DAVIS: It was the case here. 

Here, in fact, the government below never raised

 the deadline issue at all. The Federal Circuit

 raised it sua sponte. 

And then, when the Federal Circuit --

it issued an order to show cause asking for 

briefing, my client, Mr. Harrow, addressed the 

issue in briefing and the government did not 

file a brief addressing that issue. So it was 

entirely from the government -- from -- from 

that perspective sua sponte that the Federal 

Circuit raised it on its own. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, isn't -- is --

mandatory claims processing rule cannot be 

raised sua sponte by a court?

but it is -- that's not an issue here today. 

And it is also possible, there's at least one

 case, Day versus McDonough, which indicates that

 that kind of mandatory claims processing rule

 could at least potentially. That is not -- so I 

-- I wouldn't -- we are not resting our case on

 the proposition that if the -- that if this

 filing deadline is not jurisdictional, then the 

Court is necessarily unable to raise it sua 

sponte. 

The indication here, though, is what 

we would ask is at least that the Federal 

Circuit be given the opportunity on remand to 

decide whether it would raise it sua sponte. 

What was clear in the reasoning below is the 

court felt that it had to because the issue was 

jurisdictional.  And so we would like to brief 

the issue at the least on remand, that -- that 

in this circumstance either the Court can't or 

it just might not. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would the 

government be precluded from raising the 

question if we were to send the case back?

opportunity to respond, the court sua sponte

 issued an order to show cause, right?

 MR. DAVIS: That is correct, yes.  So

 I -- I would say two things. One, we would 

request that that issue be reserved for remand 

as well. For all we know, the government may or 

may not raise this issue at all.

 It may, 11 years into this pro --

mostly pro se litigation, the government just 

allow -- might allow Mr. Harrow to proceed on 

the merits with his appeal.  But the -- the 

basis for forfeiture would be not so much the 

issuance -- issuance of the order to show cause 

but the fact that after the Federal Circuit 

issued its order to show cause, the government 

chose not to submit a brief.  And that has not 

been an issue that's been briefed, the 

forfeiture issue, but we would suggest that in 

the first instance the Federal Circuit should 

address that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Am I wrong that the 

Federal Circuit has precedent that looks at this 

very deadline and holds that it's not subject to 

equitable forfeiture?

 MR. DAVIS: No, no, no, entire --

 entirely my fault.  But -- so, yes, so -- so 

there's precedent that goes back almost exactly, 

I believe, 40 years in the Federal Circuit that 

treats this filing deadline as jurisdictional 

and, therefore, not subject to forfeiture and 

not subject to equitable tolling. 

Having said that, this Court has 

repeatedly held, as early as 2006 in Arbaugh and 

as recently -- excuse me, as 2023, I believe, in 

Santos-Zacaria, that lower court precedent are 

not enough by themselves to establish -- to 

satisfy the clear statement rule. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. I'm just -- I 

guess I'm just wondering whether the equitable 

tolling finding is bound up with their 

jurisdictional finding such that if we said

 So two -- two -- two -- so three -- three

 pieces, I would say.

 One, I -- I believe it is -- those two

 are bound up.  I don't think the Federal Circuit

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I see. 

MR. DAVIS: Having said that, there is 

the issue of forfeiture, so our client still 

might get relief.  And then there's also the 

issue of whether the government on remand might 

or might not choose to pursue this issue and 

might allow Mr. Harrow, who has proceeded for 11 

years seeking $3,000 of compensation and

extraordinary, the lengths to which this case

 has gone, seven years waiting and then the email

 and all that, but I -- I just have a question on

 background.

 Both sides agree that we have a clear

 statement rule with respect to whether a

 statute's jurisdictional or a mandatory claims

 processing rule.

 I'm just curious what -- what you 

think the justification for that clear statement 

rule is, what you're understanding of its 

background? 

MR. DAVIS: Sure.  I think there's a 

-- a couple of justifications as I understand 

it. One is that in the first instance, courts 

have at times used the word "jurisdiction" 

loosely when -- with implications that Congress 

probably never intended, and so it's a -- it's a 

rule of fidelity to congressional intent in that 

sense. 

I think there is a second 

justification that has now arisen which explains 

in part why lower court decisions are not 

enough, which is having this Court at least 

since 2006 having articulated the clear

awkward, though, isn't it, because, I mean, you

 could say: Well, they -- there have been a lot

 of drive-by jurisdictional rulings, don't --

don't do that anymore, stop and -- and just 

faithfully interpret statutes.  But this Court's 

gone further and -- and said clear statement 

rule. 

MR. DAVIS: Yes, Your Honor.  I -- I 

actually -- I think either suffices in this 

instance because I do think the "pursuant to" 

language isn't strong enough, the explicit 

language of 7703(b)(1)(A) isn't -- isn't strong 

enough to infer congressional intent and the 

like. 

And -- and -- and so -- and Lindahl 

really is -- was a drive-by jurisdictional 

statement.  I do agree that the articulation has 

been stronger than that or the rule has been 

stronger than that.  And I think I would hope 

that that makes this a relatively easy case, but

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, what is your

 understanding as to why the government has

 resisted your client's case so -- so strongly?

 I mean, it -- it is -- he -- he spent seven 

years waiting, five of which were because the 

government couldn't manage to get a quorum 

together to resolve it, sent him an email to an 

old email address, and -- and he acted as 

quickly as he -- as he could and when he got it, 

and yet here we are in the Supreme Court of the 

United States over a $3,000 claim. 

MR. DAVIS: Yes.  Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  We're hearing it. 

You know, we've -- we've -- we've done every 

other claims processing rule statute on the 

books. I'm just kind of surprised we're having 

to do -- the government's making us do this one. 

MR. DAVIS: Right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do you have any 

insight? 

MR. DAVIS: I don't have insight.  I 

mean, I would say it's a little bit off point, 

but my client has great reverence for the law.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AIMEE W. BROWN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

In Section 1295(a)(9), Congress 

granted the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over 

appeals from final MSPB decisions pursuant to 

Section 7703(b)(1), which includes a deadline 

for filing an appeal. 

As this Court has recognized in cases 

like BP and SAS Institute, the plain meaning of 

"pursuant to" is "in accordance with" or "in 

compliance with." 

By conditioning the Court's 

jurisdiction on compliance with 7703(b)(1), the

statutory text provides the clear tie between 

the appeal deadline and the jurisdictional grant

 which satisfies this Court's clear statement

 rule.

 That view of the text is confirmed by

 precedent and history.  In Lindahl, this Court

 squarely addressed whether the Federal Circuit 

had jurisdiction over an appeal from the MSPB 

and held that such jurisdiction is governed by 

Section 1295(a)(9) and 7703(b)(1) together, with 

Section 7703(b)(1) setting the jurisdictional 

perimeters for the Federal Circuit's review. 

For the past 40 years, the Federal 

Circuit has recognized the same thing and has 

repeatedly held that the time limit here is 

jurisdictional.  Against the backdrop of that 

settled precedent, Congress has repeatedly 

reenacted or amended the statute, including 

specifically the time limit. 

Petitioner's contrary arguments fail 

to offer any plausible alternative reading of 

the statutory text.  His argument that none of 

Section 7703(b)(1) is jurisdictional is directly 

contrary to Lindahl and would make Section 

1295(a)(9)'s grant of jurisdiction incomplete.

And his alternative argument that the first 

sentence of 7703(b)(1) is jurisdictional but the

 second is not creates a distinction that

 Congress didn't draw.

 Adopting Petitioner's view would 

require the Court to read "pursuant to" to mean 

different things for the different sentences of

 Section 7703(b)(1).  And demanding Congress to

 speak more -- with more specificity would turn 

the clear statement rule into the kind of magic 

words requirement that this Court has repeatedly 

rejected. 

Finally, even if the Court were to 

hold that the filing deadline is not 

jurisdictional, at a minimum, it's not subject 

to equitable tolling.  Federal Rule of Appellate 

Procedure 26(b) prohibits extending the 

deadlines for filing appeals from agency 

decisions unless authorized by law.  Because 

Congress did not authorize any such extension 

under either the statute or the Federal Rules, 

Petitioner's untimely appeal cannot go forward. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

least plausible that "pursuant to" modifies

"final order"?

 MS. BROWN: I don't, and I think the

 reason for that is that if you were to -- to 

read the statute that way, it would say that the 

order or decision needed to be pursuant to or in 

accordance with, in compliance with, Section

 7703(b)(1).  But Section 7703(b)(1) doesn't 

impose any requirements or limitations on the

 order or decision. 

I think that's particularly clear if 

you look at (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) together, 

and those two provisions talk -- they -- they 

sort the cases between either the Federal 

Circuit exclusively or the Federal Circuit and 

the regional courts of appeals. And the basis 

for that sorting is not the scope of the order 

or decision.  It's based on what challenges to 

the order or decision are brought within the 

appeal. 

And so I -- I don't think it's 

actually possible to read the statute that way. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you lose if 

"pursuant to" just means "under"? 

MS. BROWN: I don't think so. As we 

said in our brief, if "under" were used in this

 I think that the easiest way to -- to

 understand that is to -- to -- to think about

 how this -- how this scheme would work or how

 this statute would --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I meant 

"under" as in "go bring an appeal under" that 

section.  "Go file an order under" that section. 

MS. BROWN: So do you -- "under" as 

kind of like an invoking, it means to invoke? 

Okay. So I -- the reason I don't think that 

that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it just 

doesn't have anything to do with whether you've 

satisfied every jot and tittle of whatever 

requirements might apply --

MS. BROWN: The --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to that section. 

MS. BROWN: I -- the reason that I 

think that that interpretation is unavailable 

here is because of what the first sentence of 

Section 7703(b)(1) does require. And I think

that it has to be the case that that part is

 jurisdictional and -- and is required by the --

the -- the reading here because, if you imagine,

 for example, that the Petitioner here had 

brought discrimination claims, and so the case 

is a mixed case, and he brought that case in the 

-- in the court of appeals, in this -- in the

 Federal Circuit in the first instance, and

 asserted that he was invoking 7703(b)(1), I 

don't think that anyone here is suggesting that 

that case would then be able to proceed in the 

Federal Circuit because the Petitioner had 

asserted or invoked or relied on 7703(b)(1).  It 

belongs in the district court under (b)(2). 

And so I think, because that 

interpretation of the statute and interpretation 

of "pursuant to" is mandated for that sentence, 

the same thing has to be true for the second 

sentence and for the time limit.

give you a chance to respond to Justice Gorsuch

 practical matter, why does the government care 

so much whether this is jurisdictional or claims

 processing?

 MS. BROWN: So I -- I think that the 

reason that we are here, we -- we take very 

seriously this Court's rulings in this area and 

its efforts to bring discipline to the use of 

jurisdiction, and we're not trying to fight 

against the application of the clear statement 

rule. 

We do think that this case is quite 

different from many of the cases that the Court 

has looked at before.  In almost every other 

case, the suit fell within a clear 

jurisdictional grant, and the question was just 

whether the -- there was another provision in 

another requirement that displaced that 

jurisdictional grant with respect to certain --

certain cases or in certain instances. 

So I think it's really only this case 

and Boechler that have dealt with the 

interpretation of a provision that's clearly --

has something to do with jurisdiction, and then 

the question there is just what is the scope of 

that jurisdictional grant.

And so I think we are still kind of

 working through and fleshing out and figuring 

out how this Court's clear statement rules do

 apply to that particular circumstance.  And I 

think, in this case, that we think we have a 

very strong argument as to why reading this --

this jurisdictional provision should lead to the

 result that the clear statement rule -- that

 even with the clear statement rule, the time 

limit here is jurisdictional, because we do have 

that clear tie with the "pursuant to" language 

that was lacking in -- in Boechler itself. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Do you have -- does 

the government have a position on the question 

Justice Alito asked you about whether a court 

can raise the mandatory claims processing rule 

sua sponte? 

MS. BROWN: Yes.  We -- we do think 

that that is permissible under the Court's 

decision in Day versus McDonough, and we think 

it's very clear that that's what the court of 

appeals, the Federal Circuit, was doing here. 

Both in its order to show cause and in its order 

dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction, 

the court relied on Rule 26.

We also think that a remand here would 

be somewhat unnecessary, in -- in part because 

the Federal Circuit does have binding precedent

 holding that -- the equitable tolling does not

 apply specifically to Rule -- to Section

 7703(b)(1).  And that -- that case, which is Oja 

versus Department of Army, specifically says,

 even if we were wrong and Section 7703(b)(1) is 

not jurisdictional, we still think that 

equitable tolling does not apply. 

And so I don't think it's the case 

that it's bound up in its decision, its 

determination about the jurisdictionality of the 

provision. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  At the very least, 

though, the government could waive, right? 

MS. BROWN: Yes, the government could 

choose to waive if it -- if it were to choose 

that.

wouldn't be wholly pointless.

separate requirements jurisdictional, and so, 

when Congress does want to do so, we've asked 

for Congress or the Court has -- has suggested 

that Congress will speak clearly.

I do think that expanding the clear 

statement rule in the way that I think you might 

have to in order to rule for the Petitioner here 

would be a problem, and I think there are kind 

of two reasons for that. 

I think that in order to rule for the 

Petitioner here, you would have to say either 

that there is something like a magic words 

requirement in the -- in the context of a 

jurisdictional grant in order to give a time 

limit jurisdictional consequences and also that 

-- or, in the alternative, I guess, that the 

Court would be saying that there are some kinds 

of extra-textual considerations like the kinds 

of things that the judiciary thinks should or 

should not be jurisdictional that can be

most clarity, do you think, for the government 

and for the courts of appeals and district 

courts, the affected courts, on these kinds of 

matters?  Maybe it is a magic words requirement 

would be better, because it seems silly to keep 

having this debate. 

MS. BROWN: I -- I suppose that for 

purposes of clarity, a magic words requirement 

would -- would be clear, but I don't think that 

it would be appropriate because, at that point, 

then you are mandating that Congress speak in a 

particular way in -- in -- particularly in this 

context. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, maybe "magic 

words" is loading the dice.  Maybe just speaks 

directly to jurisdiction.

that this provision would comply with that

 because it -- this is a jurisdictional grant.

 We -- we know that this is a jurisdictional 

grant, and no one is disputing that.

 And in that context, generally, when 

this Court is interpreting a jurisdictional 

grant, it hews very closely to the text in an

 effort to avoid either expanding or contracting 

the courts' jurisdiction because of the 

separation-of-powers concerns that come with 

that as -- as an Article III court. 

And so I think, at least in the 

context of interpreting what is a clear 

jurisdictional grant, a magic words requirement 

could raise some -- some concerns there in -- in 

putting too much of a burden on Congress --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you about 

the clear jurisdictional grant here and the 

implications of your view? 

MS. BROWN: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I'm looking at 

1295(a)(9), and it not only cross-references 

7703(b)(1), which is at issue here, but also 

7703(d).  So is it the government's position 

that all of the parts and expectations that come

 MS. BROWN: So it -- it is our 

position that, of course, because the same 

language attaches 7703(d) to 1295(a) and to the

 jurisdictional grant, that the requirements for 

bringing an appeal that are encompassed within

 (d) are also jurisdictional.  And -- and that is 

how OPM has treated them. That's how the -- the

 Board has treated them as well. 

And I recognize that there's some kind 

of raised eyebrows from some at the idea that 

the director's determination that this 

particular issue was one that should be appealed 

would be jurisdictional, but I actually don't 

think that that issue or that requirement being 

jurisdictional is that far afield from some of 

the other kinds of gatekeeping requirements for 

appeals that this Court has already held to be 

jurisdictional and there are --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But what about the 

procedural oddity of the Federal Circuit having 

an affirmative obligation to sua sponte make 

this determination in these kinds of cases if it 

was a jurisdictional provision?

that's also not particularly odd or -- or 

particularly difficult for the -- for the

 Federal Circuit to do. It's going to be 

apparent on the face of the petition itself, the

 Federal Circuit has discretionary jurisdiction 

over OPM petitions for -- for review.

 And so OPM files something that

 basically looks like a cert petition and

 includes within that a statement of jurisdiction 

that will say the director has made the 

determination that this is a case that 

qualifies.  And then I think, because that's a 

discretionary determination on the part of the 

director, the Federal Circuit is just looking 

for whether that determination was made and 

isn't actually analyzing the substance of that.

kind of stepping back a bit, buried in your 

argument is the notion that both sentences in

 wondering how you square that with the sort of

 holding and reasoning in Santos-Zacaria, where

 the -- the Court suggested that you didn't have

 to read a provision like that in -- in totality.

 MS. BROWN: So I think that the reason 

this is different from Santos-Zacaria is because 

we have the "pursuant to" that connects the 

jurisdictional grant to 7703(b)(1) as a whole. 

I think we would have a much harder argument and 

maybe an impossible argument if we were just 

looking at 7703(b)(1) out of the context of --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why is that --

MS. BROWN: -- that grant. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- different? 

Santos-Zacaria had "in accordance with this 

section" and the government made the argument 

that is very similar to this one. 

MS. BROWN: So I think that the 

difference there is that that provision in 

Santos-Zacaria, which I -- it says 

notwithstanding any other provision of law, a 

petition for review filed with an appropriate 

court of appeals, in accordance with this 

section, shall be the sole and exclusive means 

for judicial review, that provision is not the

 jurisdictional grant, and so it's not

 conditioning the Court's jurisdiction on appeals

 filed or orders filed in accordance with this

 section.  There's another section of 1252 that

 granted jurisdiction.

 So I think we would have a much harder 

argument and, again, maybe an impossible one if 

the Court had rejected our reading of a

 provision that said something like the court of 

appeals shall have jurisdiction to review 

removal orders in accordance with this section. 

But that's not how the Court read that provision 

and that's not how the provision is written. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, that seems 

exactly backwards to me, but anyway.  We'll --

MS. BROWN: I -- I just -- I think it 

is the difference between conditioning 

jurisdiction and granting jurisdiction -- as --

with a condition that it -- that it has to be in 

compliance with this section and saying in -- as 

in Santos-Zacaria, that this is the only way you 

get jurisdiction, there are no grants of 

jurisdiction outside of this section, but that 

that provision doesn't say which provisions or 

which parts of Section 1252 are themselves

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The only thing in --

in all of these cases, in this rich line of

 precedent that we have about the clear statement

 rule, the only legitimate question is what is 

the meaning of the particular statutory

 provision that's involved, and what is the 

meaning of the provision that's involved with 

respect to certain other questions that are 

subsumed under the 

jurisdictional/non-jurisdictional inquiry, such 

as can the court -- must the court raise it 

itself?  Can the -- can the argument be 

forfeited? 

Our cases have gone on -- off on 

really niggling interpretations of statutory 

language that doesn't speak at all directly and 

only very -- in a very loose way indirectly to 

this question, but part of your argument gets at 

perhaps something we could read into this which 

would be more productive, which is to ask what 

is it likely that Congress intended with respect 

to a particular type of review, and you're 

talking about review from an administrative 

agency to a -- to a court of appeals.

And that seems like it might be a more 

-- an inquiry that gets to what Congress likely 

thought had it given any thought to this

 question.  So could you elaborate on that?

 MS. BROWN: Sure.  So I -- I mean, I 

do think that that argument is persuasive and 

very helpful to us here if you look at the 

category of appeals to Article III courts.

 And I -- I think, within that 

category, of course, we have appeals from 

district courts, which the Court has already 

addressed in Bowles, and then we have appeals 

from agency decisions.  And those have in -- in 

a variety of contexts also been treated, the 

timelines there have also been treated as 

jurisdictional. 

And I do think that it makes sense to 

look at, you know, the court that's actually --

the -- whose jurisdiction is at issue and focus 

more on that inquiry than where the actual 

decision is -- is coming from. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what are the 

features of the -- the question as it arises in 

that context that would make it more likely that 

Congress would say this is a hard-and-fast rule

Of course, I recognize, as Justice Sotomayor was 

pointing out, that there are -- there are 

instances in which that happens, but I think the 

general rule is that we don't normally see that. 

I would also think that, you know, the 

fact that some amount of process has already 

been undertaken and that the -- the claims have 

been -- that have -- that have started to be 

reviewed and there has been a certain amount of 

-- of -- of that process that has already gone 

into effect would make -- would indicate that 

Congress perhaps wants or -- or would be less 

concerned with imposing kind of harsh 

consequences because you're already within kind 

of the review scheme, whereas it might then also

 efficient administration and resolution of the

considerations apply to appeals from district 

courts and to appeals from agency decisions in

is a separate argument that we've made here as 

well, but -- but even setting the separate 

argument aside, I think Rule 26, in -- in 

stating that the presumption is going to be that 

those deadlines for appeals either from Article 

III district courts or from agency decisions are 

not subject to equitable tolling or are not able 

to be extended unless Congress specifically 

states that they are, indicates that this Court 

recognized in adopting that rule that the same 

kinds of considerations apply and would -- would 

-- would warrant that kind of rule in both 

instances.

If I could speak directly to the 

history of this particular provision, I think 

that that provides even a further basis to -- to 

think that what Congress was doing here was 

requiring that this rule to be -- is

 jurisdictional.

 Prior to the creation of the Federal

 Circuit, review of MSPB decisions came through 

the Court of Claims, where the time limit for 

filing is jurisdictional, as this Court 

recognized in John R. Sand, or it came through 

regional courts of appeals through the Hobbs 

Act, where the time limits are jurisdictional 

under every circuit's precedent. 

So I think that it makes perfect sense 

that Congress would maintain the 

jurisdictionality of the time limit when it was 

just shifting review of those matters over to 

the Federal Circuit. 

And the Federal Circuit, of course, 

then held that the deadline was jurisdictional 

very soon after it was created.  Lindahl, I 

think, likewise, recognized the jurisdictional 

status of Section 7703(b)(1). 

And then, with that backdrop, Congress

has reenacted and amended 7703(b)(1) numerous 

times, and including with specific reference to

 the deadline.  It changed the deadline from 30

 days to 60 days.  It changed when the -- time

 begins to run. 

So I think Congress really has been 

quite attentive to the way that the deadlines 

operate in this area and has never indicated 

that it disagrees with the jurisdictional status 

that it's -- that's -- that it's had. 

And I -- I think, you know, this Court 

has recognized that in Helsinn a few terms ago 

that when this Court adopts an interpretation of 

a statute at least implicitly and the Federal 

Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over that 

statute and then makes explicit what was 

implicit in the Court's decision, that Congress 

is then presumed to operate with that in the 

background and to -- to know that and to, I 

guess, ratify that when it reenacts and readopts 

the same statutory language. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- and at 

what point along that history did we adopt, you 

said, they -- the clear statement rule with 

respect to jurisdictional determinations?

 MS. BROWN: So that was in Arbaugh,

 which I think is a 2006 decision I want to say. 

And the statute has been amended before that, 

but even prior to that, it was also amended. I 

think there was amendments in 1998 I want to say

 but -- but again in 2012.

 And even with all of that in place, 

and I think and with Lindahl in place

 importantly, I -- I -- I don't think that there 

is a reason to question that what the Federal 

Circuit assumed or what Congress assumed was --

was -- was happening here was that the -- the 

timeline maintains its jurisdictional status. 

If I -- if I could talk about Rule 26 

just for a moment as well, we do think that the 

Rule 26 question is -- is presented, it is -- is 

here before the Court, and we think that the 

Court should actually go ahead and decide that 

question for, I would say, I guess three 

reasons. 

The first reason is that we think it's 

a particularly easy question. The plain text of 

the rule says that Rule 26(b) applies and 

doesn't permit the extension of deadlines for --

for appeals from agency decisions.  I know that

the Petitioners have argued that it applies only 

to time limits that are contained in the rules

 themselves, but that language is not in the

 particular -- the sentence that prohibits this

 expansion.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I'm sorry, why do

 you think this is encompassed in the question

 presented in this case?

 MS. BROWN: So we -- we think that 

this -- this Court has long held that the 

Respondent can bring up any alternative basis 

for affirmance that's apparent in the record 

here. And so that's what we are -- we're 

relying on.  I -- I recognize that the 

Petitioner here hasn't framed the question to 

include equitable tolling, but we do think it's 

an appropriate exercise of this Court's 

discretion to -- to address that because it's 

apparent from the record.  And this Court has 

done so in cases like -- or has recognized that 

principle in cases like Union Pacific Railroad 

and others.

forfeiture argument that Petitioner raises in

 order to exercise that discretion in this case?

 MS. BROWN: I think you -- you would

 have to raise forfeiture.  I'm happy to -- to 

address that. I don't think that we did forfeit 

this argument. The order to show cause before

 the district court -- or before the Federal 

Circuit came right after the administrative 

record was filed but before any briefing had 

occurred.  Briefing was then stayed. 

I think that that order can itself 

reasonably be -- be viewed as mainly directed 

toward the Petitioner because it said that the 

order to show cause was the -- was to show cause 

why this case should not be dismissed, and it 

cited Rule 26, and it cited the Federal 

Circuit's binding precedent.  And so, you know, 

the government didn't really have an interest in 

explaining the same things that the -- the --

that the Federal Circuit had already recognized 

there. 

We did raise Rule 26 in our brief in 

opposition and we noted that the Petitioner had 

never said anything about waiver or forfeiture.

 discuss it, did it?

 MS. BROWN: It did include a citation

 to Rule 26.  I agree that there wasn't any kind

would -- I would say that Federal Circuit 

precedent already does make very clear that 

there -- there is binding precedent on this

 And I thought that that was the 

argument you were making in your brief, not the 

straight argument about Rule 26.

 MS. BROWN: Yes.  I'm sorry if I was 

-- if I confused the issue there. It is the 

latter argument. We do think that Rule 26 

informs the reading of 7703(b)(1). It shifts 

the presumption of equitable tolling and says 

that it does not -- it does not apply in the 

context of appeals from agency decisions.  And 

that was a rule that was in place at the time. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, if that's the 

argument you're making in your brief, and 

suppose, just suppose, that the Court rejects 

that argument and says 7703(b)(1) is not 

jurisdictional, as I read your brief, you don't 

have a separate Rule 26 argument, is that right? 

MS. BROWN: No, I -- I don't think 

that's the case.  I think that even if there is 

no jurisdictional status for this rule, the --

anything to do with Rule 26, and then, in your 

brief, you only brought up Rule 26 as something

 that would inform our understanding of the 

statute, what I'm suggesting is that you don't

 really have a Rule 26 argument here.

 MS. BROWN: Okay.  I'm sorry. I -- I

 misunderstood the question.  I think our 

argument in our brief and today is that Rule 26 

informs the reading of the statute if it's not 

jurisdictional on its own. So even if the 

statute is not jurisdictional under this -- this 

Court's holding and it reads 1295(a) -- (a)(9) 

and 7703(b)(1) and says that -- that there is 

not a jurisdictional rule here, that then leaves 

open the question whether equitable tolling can 

apply or whether there can be extensions. 

And at that point, when there is no 

language in the statute that speaks to that, 

then you either have the Irwin presumption on 

the one hand that would say yes, we assume 

equitable tolling applies, or you have Rule 26, 

which displaces that presumption and says no, if 

Congress hasn't express -- expressly stated 

otherwise, then equitable tolling does -- does 

not apply, and that's where we think Rule 26

comes into play here.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You think that 

question's simple enough for us to resolve here 

in addition to the main question?

 MS. BROWN: We do. We do think that

 the -- the text of Rule 26 is -- is fairly clear

 here and -- and says that it applies as a

 background rule and a background principle in --

in the interpretation of statutes. 

I -- I -- as I was saying earlier, I 

think the Petitioner has argued that it only 

applies to deadlines that appear in the rules 

themselves.  But that is -- that's incorrect. 

The language of the statute -- of the rules does 

-- doesn't say that in the provision that 

actually talks about the prohibition on 

extending deadlines. 

That's even clearer if you look at the 

earlier versions of the rule that were in effect 

when Section 7703(b)(1) was enacted.  We've 

included those in our appendix on pages 10a and 

11a. And, there, it says, "nor may the Court 

enlarge the time prescribed by law" for appeals 

or for petitions of review of agency decisions. 

So we think that's very clear in stating that --

that the rule applies even to -- to statutory

 deadlines as well.

 And when the language was shifted to 

its current form in 1998, the submission that 

the Chief Justice gave to Congress said that

 this was just a stylistic change.  It wasn't 

meant to alter the substance of the rule. And

 so I -- we do think that that's an easy

 question. 

I guess, to go back again to the 

second reason that we think that the Court 

should address Rule 26 here, again, I'll refer 

to the binding precedent of the Federal Circuit. 

I think, if this is remanded, it's very clear 

what the Federal Circuit would do based on that 

precedent. 

And then the third reason just kind of 

goes to the consequences of the determination 

that the time limit is not jurisdictional, which 

is an issue that the parties have joined issue 

on and have -- have discussed.  And so we do 

think it would be appropriate for the Court 

to -- to make that determination now and it 

would be efficient to do so.

Petitioner's reading is plausible, do you lose?

 MS. BROWN: So, when this Court has

 explained the clear statement rule, I don't

 think right -- up until this point or as of yet, 

the Court has said that if there is one other

 plausible definition or interpretation, then

 it's not clear.  The Court in Boechler said that 

if there are multiple plausible interpretations 

and only one of them is jurisdictional, it's 

going to be very hard for the government to 

prove that the statement is clear.  But, thus 

far, I think the -- the -- the most common 

formulation of the clear statement rule is just 

that. 

If -- if Congress wants to make a 

certain -- a certain provision jurisdictional, 

it has to clearly state that it is. And so I --

I don't think the -- the Court has gone that far 

yet, but if it could do so, I'm sure. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Going back to the 

Rule 26 issue, Mr. Davis suggests, I guess, in 

conjunction with -- with Justice Gorsuch's

 MS. BROWN: I -- I haven't spoken with 

the -- the agency about what it intends to press 

on remand if the Court does bring it to -- to

 that point.  I -- I do think that the agency and

 the government in general has a fairly strong 

interest in ensuring that Rule 26 is accurately

 applied and that this doesn't open the door to 

the potential for equitable tolling in all sorts 

of other state -- other cases in which --

the Federal Circuit would still have the option 

of bringing it up sua sponte on its own as well, 

which it kind of already has done within the 

order to show cause and the order for -- and the

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA P. DAVIS 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DAVIS: So just a -- a -- a small

 number of points on rebuttal. 

The first one is the analogy, excuse 

me, to Section 7703(b)(2) where the government 

argues the first sentence must be 

jurisdictional.  The difficulty for the 

government by invoking that particular provision 

is that in Kloeckner, this Court held that even 

if the first sentence there is juris --

jurisdictional, the very close -- the filing 

deadline in the second sentence is not. And so, 

if one is going to rely on that very close 

parallel textual interpretation, that would 

actually place the government in a position 

where it is possible that one of those sentences 

could have some jurisdictional implications with 

the other one not.

don't think that analogy helps the government.

 Second, the government took the 

position that if there were a mixed case, and so

 it would go -- would -- would necessarily fit

 appropriately under 7703(b)(1), no one would

 contest -- I'm sorry, under (b)(2), no one would 

contest that there would be a lack of 

jurisdiction if the Petitioner invoked 

7703(b)(1). 

That's not the only possible 

interpretation, but, in fact, the government's 

position is directly opposite to the holding of 

this case in BP P.L.C. as I understand it, where 

the "pursuant to" language was used and this 

Court said that "pursuant to" can be consistent, 

and it was there consistent with invoking. 

And the answer to the question of, 

well, how then can you go forward with a -- a --

a mixed case under (b)(1) is, well, if it's 

frivolous, then there are other ways to police 

that, including sanctions and attorney's fees 

and costs.  And nobody here is arguing that Mr.

Harrow isn't appropriately proceeding under 

(b)(1). So I think the kind of -- reductio ad 

absurdum that the government invoked is contrary

 to at least one Supreme Court precedent.

 Two -- well, one final point.  Oh, I'm 

sorry, two final points quickly.

 In terms of the timing of the amending

 of (b)(1)(A), the most recent amendment was 

2012. And in 2012, the clear statement rule was 

already established, including the statement in 

Arbaugh in 2006 that lower court precedents by 

themselves are not enough to satisfy the clear 

statement rule, so if we are inferring 

Congress's intent from the amendments to 

(b)(1)(A), the natural inference would be that 

Congress was listening to this Court and not to 

the Federal Circuit precedents that this Court 

said it should -- it should not listen to. 

And then the -- the last point I would 

say is the question presented is, in fact, 

limited to the jurisdictional nature or not of 

the filing deadline.  I do think that between 

forfeiture and the complexities at equitable 

tolling, government discretion on remand not to 

raise this issue, and the complexities under

26(b), which include not only that the -- the

 rule -- it cites to the rules and not statutes, 

we did not make the complete set of arguments

 about Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(b).

 We would like the opportunity if this Court 

decides the deadline is not jurisdictional to do

 so on remand.

 We think, if that issue were to get 

back up to this Court, the Court would be in a 

much better position to rule effectively with 

that sort of background.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
