 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-324,

 O'Connor-Ratcliff versus Garnier.

 Mr. Mooppan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MOOPPAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Individuals who hold public office are 

still private citizens too.  When acting in 

their personal capacity, they retain their First 

Amendment rights to decide who can participate 

in a community discussion that they host at 

their own property.  They are thus free to block 

users from their personal social media pages, 

unless they chose to operate those pages in 

their official capacities instead. 

The only principled and workable test 

to determine the capacity in which they acted is 

to ask whether they exercised any duties or 

authorities of their job.  And the answer is 

plainly no where, as here, the state itself did 

not control or even facilitate their operation

of the pages. The officials thus wielded no 

greater rights or privileges than any other 

private citizen denying access to their own

 property.

 The Ninth Circuit instead held that 

even if an official was not actually doing her 

job, state action exists so long as the pages'

 appearance made it look like she was.

 But that type of reasonable observer 

inquiry is incapable of consistent application. 

It is also fundamentally misguided because the 

official's power to block does not invoke the 

pages' appearance at all. 

Respondents alternatively insist that 

Petitioners were doing their jobs simply because 

they used the pages to communicate about their 

jobs. But that is the type of excessively broad 

job description this Court has repeatedly 

rejected.  Because officials could operate such 

pages in either capacity, the state action test 

should require clear and objective evidence that 

is capable of differentiating between the two. 

That is essential to preserving the robust 

sphere of individual liberty the doctrine is 

meant to protect.

I welcome this Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, if you had 

the exact same exchange here but from a -- an 

official site of the school board, would it make

 a difference?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Yes, Your Honor.  That

 would be state action because that would be

 exercising the power --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. So let's 

assume that the official has discretion to 

either -- the option to either do this on the 

school site or -- the school board site or on 

the personal computer. 

What's the difference in what the 

communication is? 

MR. MOOPPAN: So, in your first 

hypothetical, the power that's being wielded is 

the power to exclude someone from government 

property.  Just like if it was a government 

building, the power to block someone from 

entering Main Justice is a -- is state action. 

In the actual case, what is happening 

is being excluded from private property.  And 

the power to exclude someone from private 

property is private.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let's -- let's

 talk about that just briefly.  What if the --

you can access the site remotely from 

Petitioners' computer at home, but it is the --

the school board's site and it's not on

 government's computer?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, the question is

 who controls the account.  And in this case,

 it's undisputed that this is the account of --

belongs to Petitioners in their individual 

capacity.  It's an account that they created 

before they held office.  It is an account that 

they will continue to hold after they leave 

office.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is this 

a site-by-site determination or a 

message-by-message?  In other words, let's say 

you have, you know, a site that's used every now 

and then for what you might characterize as 

official announcements, but the rest of the time 

it's, you know -- you know, my -- my child got 

a, you know, blue ribbon or something like that. 

Do you say that, well, you look at 

each episode of blocking or whatever as -- as 

governmental because they use it for

 governmental things from time to time, or do you

 say, well, they blocked them for this -- in --

in other words, you go through the whole

 analysis with respect to each back-and-forth?

 MR. MOOPPAN: So the specific conduct 

that's being challenged here is the blocking, 

and so the question is, is the blocking official

 action?  In general, I think that that's going 

to be answered at a site-wide level.  It's 

either a government account or it's a personal 

account.  And that's true even if some of the 

speech could be viewed as official. 

So if, for example, a government 

official made an official announcement that --

at a campaign rally, the announcement, the 

speech, might be viewed as official in some 

sense. But that wouldn't convert the campaign 

rally into a government forum where there was a 

constitutional right to enter. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not 

sure I follow the -- the answer. But let's say 

-- what percentage of governmental blocking or 

back-and-forth do you have to have before you 

say, oh, the whole -- every -- every blocking 

episode should be quickly characterized as state

 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, so I don't think

 it turns on a percentage, Your Honor.  In 

general, when a public official is using their 

personal property to engage in speech that they 

can engage in either capacity, the right way of 

thinking about that in general is that all of 

that speech is personal.

 Now I concede that if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just --

sorry. All of that -- all -- all of the speech 

on that site? 

MR. MOOPPAN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

MR. MOOPPAN: Because that is speech 

they can engage in in either capacity.  Now I do 

agree that there are certain things that they 

could do on these pages that would be 

governmental and for which there was a right of 

access.  So, for example, the SG's office used 

the example of doing notice-and-comment 

rulemaking on a social media page.  That's, of 

course, inherently governmental, and if they're 

excluded from that, that would be state action. 

And I would agree that that would be

true whether they used the page in general for

 notice-and-comment rulemaking or just once.  But

 the question --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I -- I'm

 having -- because I think the Chief has asked a 

very important question, let's break that down

 in examples, okay?

 Facebook is somewhat easier because

 people can be blocked from commenting, but 

they'll still have access to looking at the 

information, right?  But let's assume that 

there's -- something went wrong with the city's 

website and the city is now asking the council 

member to post all of their evacuation programs 

and to have comments with respect to citizens 

who might need assistance.  They've converted it 

into, basically, an official site. 

So how does your test deal with that? 

MR. MOOPPAN: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you said, 

if it's mixed personal and business, then it's 

-- remains personal. 

MR. MOOPPAN: Well, so, on that 

hypothetical, I would agree that would be state 

action.  The way --

be responsible for any blocking that this 

individual had done of commenting people?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Yes, but the critical 

reason why and the -- why that follows from our 

test is because, in your hypothetical --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By the way, your

duty and authority test or authority test, or --

you use the words "control" or "facilitate," 

which the Sixth Circuit didn't.  So tell me 

what's the difference --

MR. MOOPPAN: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in what you're 

proposing. 

MR. MOOPPAN: -- we think duty or 

authority is the right test.  The hard question 

in these cases is figuring out whether you're 

exercising duty or authority.  Control and 

facilitation is the way to figure that out. And 

that's the answer to your initial question.  The 

way you know --

Circuit is much narrower.  It -- it -- it

What happens now when, if you don't

MR. MOOPPAN: That shouldn't matter, 

and I'll give you two reasons why it shouldn't. 

So the first, the conceptual reason, 

is because the challenge here is they're 

challenging blocking.  And my clients' power to 

block doesn't turn on the appearance. 

And here's a hypothetical that I think 

will make that pretty clear.  Imagine you're a 

police officer and you finish your shift, you're 

running late to pick up your kids from school, 

so you go running down the street still in your 

uniform and you push someone out of the way. 

Everyone on the street probably 

assumes you're still doing your job and in hot 

pursuit of a felon, but that's not state action.

caveat. In your hypothetical, when you said

 that this is the town manager's page, if he was 

saying, this is a page I'm running in my 

official capacity, then I wouldn't take that

 position.  But by that -- that statement has

 substantive content behind it. 

When you say this is the town 

manager's page in his official capacity, what 

you're essentially admitting is the town 

manager's boss could tell him what to do on the 

page. He's admitting at that point that it is a 

governmental page. 

But, if instead, as I think your 

hypothetical was meant to suggest, he's just 

saying, I am the town manager, this is what I 

think, this is where you want to talk to me,

 President Trump's Twitter account was also

 personal?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Yeah, I think that was a

 harder question, Your Honor, because there was 

in that case use of a government staffer to help 

him run the page.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose that there

 wasn't.  Suppose that, you know, he gave every

 indication of writing his tweets himself, and 

suppose he had also posted them, so there wasn't 

a staffer involved. 

MR. MOOPPAN: Yes, Your Honor, then I 

think that he is engaging in his First Amendment 

rights under this Court's decision in Lane to 

talk about the government in his individual 

capacity. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But he seems to be 

doing, you know, a lot of government on his 

Twitter account.  I mean, sometimes he was 

announcing policies. 

Even when he wasn't, I mean, I -- I 

don't think a citizen would be able to really 

understand the Trump presidency, if you will, 

without any access to all the things that the 

President said on that account. It was an

 important part of how he wielded his authority.

 And to cut -- cut a citizen off from that is to 

cut a citizen off from part of the way that

 government works.

 MR. MOOPPAN: So a couple things about

 that, Your Honor.  The first is President Trump

 could have done exactly the same thing from

 Mar-a-Lago or a campaign rally.  If he gave 

every one of those speeches at his personal 

residence, it wouldn't somehow convert his 

residence into government property. 

And in terms of people being cut off 

from it, people don't have a right to access 

other people's personal property.  The blocking 

here doesn't turn on --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I have to say that 

seems a little bit, you know, to focus on the 

wrong end of the stick, if you will.  I mean, 

the fact that it was his personal property seems 

neither here nor there.  If, really, he was 

doing government on it and wielding his 

authority on it and announcing policy on it and 

-- and -- and, you know, it was part of the way 

government operated.

 think that's quite right, Your Honor.  Imagine 

he had put on his page a clear disclaimer, this

 is my page that I'm using in my personal 

capacity to talk about the government. This is

 not an official page.  Every single word on that 

Twitter account could have been the same because

 he's allowed --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But why --

 why shouldn't we -- why shouldn't we require 

that then if you're right?  In other words, it 

seems to me the problem that we're having is, 

even if we agree with you that government 

officials can operate in their personal capacity 

and in their official capacity, why should they 

get to choose whether or not they're doing one 

or the other without, say, making a clear 

disclaimer or making it clear to people that 

this is actually happening in their personal 

capacity? 

MR. MOOPPAN: So I'll give you two 

reasons, one conceptual and one practical. 

The conceptual reason is because the 

First Amendment generally doesn't compel speech. 

It generally protects against compelled speech.

can't have it both ways.  I mean, you know, to 

the extent that we know and we agree with you 

that the person can operate in one or the other, 

I don't understand why it would necessarily be a

 compulsion to have them do so clearly.

 MR. MOOPPAN: So, here, because what 

is basically being said is, if everyone agrees 

my clients could have said this in their 

individual capacity and had First Amendment 

rights to do so, but they will lose those rights 

unless they put up a disclaimer, that is 

basically saying --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, no. I'm not 

saying they lose the right, right? You can --

you can go down Row A or Row B.  You -- you have 

the freedom to do that. 

The question in this case is, how do 

we know which you have chosen? 

MR. MOOPPAN: Right.  And so the 

disclaimer is essentially a condition that is 

being required to go down Row A rather than Row 

B. That is an odd thing to say that the First 

Amendment of its own force compels. 

Let me also give you a practical 

reason why this is the right way to think about

 There are lots of government officials in this 

country. They are probably not all going to

 read this Court's decision.  And if you adopt a 

rule that the only way they can exercise their 

rights under Halleck to exclude people from

 their personal property is to include a 

disclaimer, some of those people aren't going to 

do it and they're going to lose their First 

Amendment rights. 

And that's the exact opposite of how 

the First Amendment normally works.  This Court 

normally adopts presumptions and rules that 

protect the First Amendment, that set up 

prophylactic boundaries to ensure that you don't 

inadvertently lose your rights through --

 MR. MOOPPAN: Right.  But --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's what makes 

these cases hard, is that there are First

 Amendment interests all over the place.

 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, but the difficulty 

is, as Justice Jackson said, it is entirely in 

my clients' control whether these pages are used 

in their individual capacity or their official 

capacity.  So whatever First Amendment interest 

is on the other side, it's extraordinarily weak 

because all we had to do is put up a disclaimer 

and their right goes -- completely evaporates. 

So, on the one hand, you would be 

adopting a rule that every government official 

in this country runs the risk of inadvertently 

losing control over their property because they 

didn't put up a disclaimer. 

On the other hand, you have a 

disclaimer.  Then our clients are still blocked

in Halleck.  And since this is a private 

account, there is no question that this is not 

owned by the government or controlled by the

 government, and it's entirely in my clients'

 plenary power whether to open it up to the

 public.

 That's why I don't think that -- if 

you have any interest, they have very minimal

 interest, and it's one that could be wiped out 

with a disclaimer.  And there are a lot of good 

reasons why the Court shouldn't require that. 

The other thing I will say about a 

disclaimer, though, Your Honor, is, if there is 

concern about confusion, the right place to do 

that is by the state regulating.  Un- -- rather 

than this Court adopting as a rule of 

constitutional law that the First Amendment, of 

its own force, somehow requires a disclaimer, 

the much better way to handle this is the State 

of California, if they think there's a problem, 

if they think people are confused, they can 

regulate.  They can regulate my clients because 

they're a government employer.  My clients are 

government employees.  The state has broad power 

to regulate in that capacity.

especially true because, to go back to a point I 

made earlier, the blocking doesn't turn on the

 confusion.  My clients will be able to block

 them whether or not they were confused about the

 page, just like the officer running down the

 street.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Sotomayor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep saying 

that what matters is that this user, both a 

personal user and a government user, could do 

the same thing equally.  I know that's important 

to the government as well. 

But I don't know why that matters, 

meaning, if the issue -- and it seems that what 

it's devolving down in this conversation is 

whether this particular act in this context is 

government action or not, not whether the 

account is personal or business.  Whether the 

account is personal or business may inform 

whether we have to take a second step or not. 

So, if it's a personal account, then 

you have to figure out whether it's being

That was the government's example of, if a

 private account starts doing notice-and-comment 

on legislation, that process is governmental,

 isn't it?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's assume a 

mayor says, I'm setting up a hotline for 

emergencies on my Facebook or Twitter, and if 

you have an emergency, call that hotline, and I 

will use the power of my office to set in motion 

government response for your emergency. 

Seems to me that that's government 

action, isn't it?  He's -- the -- the state is 

facilitating by the duties it's given him his 

ability to put government resources into action. 

MR. MOOPPAN: The response to that 

phone call is undoubtedly government action. 

Whether setting up the phone call is depends. 

So take, for example, Mayor Bloom --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if he 

routinely uses or responds to those calls in an 

official way, that process doesn't become 

government action?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He could exclude

 Muslims, Jews, whoever he wanted to exclude,

 blacks, whatever, women, because it -- that's a

 social account?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Imagine if Mayor 

Bloomberg, as an act of charity to the City of 

New York, had set up in his personal capacity a 

phone message or an Internet system like that. 

He paid for it out of his own pocket, no 

government resources were used for it, no one in 

the State of New York could tell him how to run 

that because it was his own personal phone 

exchange.  That would be personal capacity 

action. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why isn't that 

-- isn't that account facilitating his duties as 

a mayor?  He's using it to now put the resources 

of the government to use as mayor. 

MR. MOOPPAN: No.  He, like any other 

private citizen, is helping people contact the 

government.  Any private citizen has the ability 

to do that.  And the question of whether the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not every private 

individual has the ability to put the mechanisms

 of government into effect.

 MR. MOOPPAN: Right.  That's on the

 back end.  I conceded that the back-end response

 would clearly be state action.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the --

MR. MOOPPAN: My only point is that

 the front-end --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the problem I 

have is that it's all intertwined. 

MR. MOOPPAN: I don't think so, Your 

Honor, because, again, you can have that exact 

same phone system set up by some wealthy donor, 

and that clearly wouldn't be state action.  That 

would be private charitable giving to help the 

government run better.  And just like as this 

Court held in Lane, a government official could 

be still acting in their individual capacity 

even when they're speaking about information 

they learn as part of their job.  That doesn't 

mean that they're doing their job. 

The way to figure out whether they're 

doing their job is to figure out whether they're 

using government resources, whether the

 And to the contrary, these pages, the

 about that, Your Honor.

 First of all, since the user names of 

the pages, Moore for PUSD and Zane for School 

Board, are both campaign slogans, that's a 

pretty good indicia that it is a campaign page. 

Another good indicia of the fact that 

it's a campaign page is that they didn't have 

another campaign page. So they would either 

have to be the only two officials in America who 

decided not to have a social media page when 

they were running for reelection, or these were 

those pages.

it's a way of disentangling the two.  If your 

boss can tell you what to do, then we know

the next case, where it's the city administrator

 who has a boss.  He's got a mayor.

 Now you're right that in my case, the 

school board officials, there's limited

 oversight above them.  But that's just a matter 

of positive state law. Imagine if State of 

California had a czar of official web pages. 

All California official web pages are regulated 

by the czar. He says, put up the state motto, 

do this, that, and the other thing, and don't do 

these other things. 

No one would think that that guy could 

tell my clients what to do on these pages.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Just curious on your 

side of the v in both cases, we have a profusion 

of possible tests to choose among.  You've 

offered one, the Solicitor General has offered 

another, the Sixth Circuit has a slight 

variance. 

You've now had time to stew on this 

case for a number of months and think about it. 

What's your best advice for us on your side of

the v, what test you'd propose?

 MR. MOOPPAN: So I continue to think

 that the best test is that to look to duties and 

authorities and to say that if duties -- if

 there is neither the exercise of duty nor

 authority, that's not state action.  That's all 

you need to do to resolve this case.

 Now that raises the further question 

of: Well, how do you know whether there are 

duties and authorities?  At that point, we're 

not talking about a test.  We're talking about 

how to implement the test. And I think the 

things that the Court should be looking at are 

objective indicia that are capable of 

disentangling the two capacities. 

So things like the use of resources, 

the exercise of supervision, the exercise of 

exclusive duties, those are things that will 

help you figure out is this actually exercising 

duties and authorities of your office or is it 

instead exercising your First Amendment rights 

under Lane to talk about the government but not 

as the government. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And how does that 

test interact with Griffin in your view?

MR. MOOPPAN: So, in Griffin, the 

officer was exercising the authorities of his

 office.  He was a deputy sheriff.  He was

 wearing a badge.  And he arrested someone as the

 deputy sheriff.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So that's an

 authority case --

MR. MOOPPAN: That is an authority

 case. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- in your -- in 

your scheme? 

MR. MOOPPAN: And the counter-example 

is the hypothetical I gave earlier.  A police 

officer in full uniform runs down the street, 

pushes someone out of the way, but he's doing it 

to pick up his kid. That may look like he's 

doing his job, but he's not doing his job and 

he's not invoking his power. 

That would not be state action. 

There's no lower court that would find state 

action in a case like that.  Lower courts have 

rejected state action in much closer cases than 

that.

 Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Just to press a 

little bit on how you would apply the test, so 

I'm assuming that the information that would be

 posted is not also posted on a government site, 

so it's only posted on the personal site. This

 picks up a little bit on some of Justice Kagan's

 hypotheticals.

 But suppose the city manager on the 

personal site says, we have new recycling rules, 

you have to use a blue bin, has to be at the 

curb, will be picked up on Wednesdays.  If you 

have any questions, contact me.  That's only on 

the personal site, not on the official site. 

Is that state action? 

MR. MOOPPAN: There might well be an 

argument there because, in that point, I assume 

that there is a duty as a state official to 

announce the rules, right?  People need to know 

what the rules are. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.

 announce rules.  Is announcing rules state

 action?

 anytime a government official tells the public 

anything, that is state action, because that's 

too far, because there are lots of things that

 the government official could be telling the

 public purely in his personal capacity.

 But, for most of the hypotheticals I

 think you were asking me in the line of

 questions you were about to ask, yes, if you're 

telling people things about the rules of the 

road of the government, things that as a 

governmental matter you have a duty to disclose 

because you can't just spring rules on people or 

tell people -- not tell people things they need 

to know in their official capacity, then, if 

that's the only place you announce that, is your 

government account, then I assume that that's 

likely going to be a very strong indicia that

 Kagan's point.

next case, the mayor is the boss.

have been a lot of thefts and burglaries in 

the -- in the neighborhood.  Lock your cars.  If 

you're going away for a few days --

duty to do that.

 They could do that in their official 

capacity. So, for that sort of speech, you're

 going to need something more.  You're going to 

need to see that they're either, like, using 

staffers to prepare it or their bosses are 

telling them to do it, but the speech by itself 

isn't going to be enough for something like 

that. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So I think you've 

distinguished announcing rules if it's only on 

the personal site from notices of government 

information, and that's kind of fuzzy.  And 

reminders would not be.  Is that --

MR. MOOPPAN: I think that's right, 

Your Honor.  I -- look, again, to take --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That's the kind of

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, Mr. Mooppan, 

when you were having this colloquy with Justice 

Kavanaugh, you all were talking post by post.

 The Chief Justice asked you at the start, are we 

looking at this as whose account is it or are we

 looking at specific actions.  It kind of sounded 

to me when you were talking to Justice Kavanaugh 

that your position, which I kind of understood 

your initial position to be no, we're -- we're 

looking at the account, but which is it? 

MR. MOOPPAN: So I think it's true 

that you're looking at the account and the 

blocking, but as I told the Chief Justice at the 

very end of our colloquy and now with Justice 

Kavanaugh, if you use the account even in part 

for what is an exclusive governmental duty to 

give notice to the public or engage with the 

public, I agree at that point it's going to be 

state action. 

The reason why I think it's important 

to think about this at the account level is 

there's a lot of speech that might be -- speech

that might be viewed as official but isn't an 

official duty to provide information to people

 in, like, the hypotheticals Justice Kavanaugh

 was asking me.

 And I -- so a way of differentiating 

the two, announcing, for example, that I'm going 

to sign a bill, announcing I'm going to appoint 

a judge, those sort of things are things you

 could do in a -- even if you view those as 

official in some sense, that doesn't mean that 

you're using the property where you make that 

speech in an official capacity.  You can engage 

in that type of speech at a campaign rally, at a 

church, in your backyard, and --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So we are kind of 

looking post by post, I think? 

MR. MOOPPAN: If you're talking about 

exclusive duties, I agree with you. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And -- and I 

have a question about this word "duty."  So what 

is the point of talking about both duty and 

authority?  Because it seems to me that duty, 

and this kind of runs throughout the brief, 

sometimes it's described as obligations. 

You described it just now as an

exclusive government duty, a requirement, that 

appears sometimes in the briefs, but sometimes

 there are things you have the authority to do as 

a government official that you're not required

 or obligated to do.

 So it seems to me that if you have the

 authority to do them, something that you have a 

duty to do is just a subset of authority.

 So why are we talking about duty? 

MR. MOOPPAN: So, look, I think -- I 

think you're right that duties and authorities 

sometimes are flip sides of the same coin in 

general and that you can have exercises of 

authority that are permissive but not required. 

So I agree with all of that. 

I think authority does add something 

beyond duty.  I think what it's helpful most for 

is things like the use of staffing, the use of 

resources, things like that that don't really 

directly go to the question of is it duty or --

but it is the wielding of authority. 

Now that sort of thing is relevant for 

two reasons.  One, it's good evidence that 

you're wielding a duty or authority if you're 

using government resources or staffing.  And,

two, it's possible that at least in some cases 

the mere use of those resources alone could be

 state action.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  See, I mean, I

 guess, I just think using the word "authority" 

-- I mean, I get in the -- in the Sixth Circuit 

case that's what the opinion seems to be --

that's -- that's the -- I don't know -- that's

 the value of authority, I think, in the Sixth 

Circuit opinion, but it just seems to me like a 

weird way to describe it. 

I think of it more as evidence, right? 

I mean, am I losing a whole lot if I don't want 

to use the word "duty" and if I just say 

"authority?"  Maybe that would pick up some of 

that stuff that you're talking about anyway? 

MR. MOOPPAN: I don't think you're 

losing a lot.  I think you could frame it either 

way. As I said, I think they are flip sides of 

the same coin. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  You were 

talking a lot about property, which is the 

government's focus.  So you've articulated the 

test. As Justice Gorsuch said, we have lots of

What is the difference, what's the 

daylight between the government's position and 

your position, you know, their focus on is this

 private property that the public official is 

inviting you onto, you know, the test that they 

propose, versus the authority, duty, control

 test that you do?

 MR. MOOPPAN: So I don't actually

 think there's any daylight between our 

positions, though you can ask my friend.  I --

they've obviously emphasized property as sort of 

this initial gating mechanism --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Uh-huh. 

MR. MOOPPAN: -- whereas we view the 

fact that it's private property as quite 

relevant to determining are you exercising 

duties or authorities of your office. 

But, at the end of the day, I think 

the cases all sort of cash out the same way. 

Whether you apply our framework or theirs, you 

essentially end up in a spot where, if you're 

using a private account and you're not 

exercising an exclusive governmental function 

and you're not using government resource and the 

government can't control it, then you're -- you

in your personal capacity because personal --

people have the right as government officials to 

talk about their jobs in their personal 

capacity, and you should assume that when they 

do that on their own personal property, they're

 acting in their personal capacity.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay, last question. 

At the beginning of your argument, you referred 

to unless someone is choosing to use their 

Facebook account, Twitter account, whatever, in 

their official capacity.  And Justice Kagan's 

questions were getting to some of this. 

I think it's very difficult when you 

have an official who can in some sense define 

his own authority.  So I think, for a governor 

or, you know, President Trump, it's a harder 

call than someone like a police officer, who's a 

subordinate.  Or I could -- you know, my law 

clerk could just start posting things and say 

this is the official business of the Barrett

Governor Newsom decides to do it, he has the

 authority to define the scope of his authority. 

I would have thought in your clients' context 

they don't actually have full-ranging authority 

just as board members, right, unless the board 

said, we've taken a vote and you are the one 

who's our communications person, you are the 

point person on communications.  Then you would 

look at a source of authority, but if in that 

context -- I mean, I guess it just kind of 

depends official by official. 

I -- I guess I'm not understanding in 

your specific, for your client, why there would 

be an argument even.  It seemed like you were 

conceding a little bit in talking to Justice 

Kavanaugh about official announcements and that 

sort of thing.  Would that be true for your 

clients? 

MR. MOOPPAN: Look, I -- yes, I think, 

if my clients -- you know, if -- if, for 

example, there was a slush fund at the board to, 

you know, use money for doing your job and my

clients used that money to, like, buy a Facebook 

account or use advertising on Facebook, I -- I 

-- I don't think my clients would be acting in 

an ultra vires fashion, and I think that that

 would be exercising state action.

 Now I do agree with you, Your Honor, 

that on the control piece of using control as 

evidence of whether it's governmental or not, it

 becomes harder the higher up you go in the chain 

because it's harder to identify a superior who 

can tell you what to do. 

But even take, for example, the 

Governor of California.  Well, the Governor of 

California does have a boss.  The boss is the 

people of the State of California, who could, 

for example, amend their constitution, and they 

could amend their constitution and say that even 

the Governor, when he's using -- exercising his 

official capacity, here's what he can and cannot 

say on a social media page. 

And they certainly could not do that 

for this sort of page, for a page that he owned 

before he was the Governor, that he will own 

after he's the Governor, and that he uses only 

to say things that, under Lane, he has a First

 Amendment right to say in his individual

 capacity.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I'm still 

not clear why the onus isn't on the government 

official to be clear about the capacity in which 

they're operating. I mean, I take your point 

that you can have an individual who's a public 

official and they can operate in both worlds, 

official and also personal. 

But, to the extent that we're having a 

problem or at least I'm having a problem, it's 

because we can't identify whether this 

particular action is occurring in one world 

rather than the other.  And we've said in -- in 

lines of cases -- like the Pickering line of 

cases, we've recognized that even though public 

employees have a First Amendment right to speak, 

they can be limited in that ability to speak. 

So it doesn't seem responsive to me at 

least for you to say: Well, they have a First 

Amendment right, so they have -- they bear no 

responsibility in making clear as to when they

can you just say more about that?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Sure.  I'll -- I'll try.

 I'll -- I'll say three things.

 So the first is, again, the conduct

 that they're objecting to is the blocking.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.

 MR. MOOPPAN: They are -- this is not 

a case where they're complaining because they 

were confused, that they thought it was 

official, and if they had known it was official, 

something else would have happened.  Everything 

in this case would have been exactly the same if 

that page was plastered with disclaimers. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, but -- but --

MR. MOOPPAN: So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- but it's not --

no, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, 

when we isolate the blocking -- and you're 

right, that is the claim -- we have to think 

about, as Justice Kagan pointed out, the 

implications of that on the First Amendment 

rights of the people who want to see the page. 

So what's happening is they're being 

blocked from either commenting or seeing the 

Heritage Reporting Corporation

information that's being posted on this 

particular page. And when the official says, 

but that particular page is my private page and 

I'm operating in a private capacity, then I

 suppose we have one set of answers.  But, if we 

believe that that page is actually operating as 

the official government page and the person is 

being blocked, we might have a different set of

 answers. 

So the question is, with respect to 

the blocking, is it happening in a personal or 

an official capacity, and why wouldn't it be the 

-- the public official's responsibility to say, 

if you're on this page and you're either seeing 

or not seeing things, understand this is a 

personal repository of information? 

MR. MOOPPAN: Right.  So, again, I 

guess what I would say, Your Honor, is, if you 

concede that my clients could have done this in 

their personal capacity with disclaimers, the 

question is where in the Constitution are they 

obligated to put up the disclaimer if they want 

to maintain those rights.

believe that they're doing it in their personal

one set of questions.

 MR. MOOPPAN: -- to be fair, they've 

got the burden of proof. They are the 

plaintiffs in this case.  They are the ones who 

are arguing it's state action.  So the burden 

should be on them to show the opposite, not on 

my clients to disprove it. 

The second point I would make --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So -- so you're 

saying that a public official can just make a 

decision sub silentio about which world they're 

operating in, not let anybody know, and it would 

be the burden on whoever is saying that you are 

violating my constitutional rights to determine 

that you were actually operating in the -- the 

-- the official capacity? 

MR. MOOPPAN: Yeah, in a case like 

this, where there's no objective indicia that 

they were doing it in their governmental role,

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  What about the page, 

the way it looks, the way -- this is the other

 argument, right?

 MR. MOOPPAN: Everything about this 

page's appearance is equally consistent with a 

campaign page. That's exactly what happened in

 the Eighth Circuit.  A page that looked no 

different than our page, the justices -- judges 

just split, saying, well --

ask one more question?  I'm sorry.  Justice 

Sotomayor came up with a private hotline example 

to seek emergency help that I thought was really 

interesting.  I hadn't thought of it before. 

And I understood you to say that the 

response, the government rushes to your house as 

a result of getting the communication, would be 

official action. But I guess I'm not clear as 

to the blocking that would occur by the -- by 

the official from people that they didn't like 

with respect to a page that was designated as 

this is the opportunity to call for government 

help. I'm creating this Facebook page so that

 The person, I guess, is saying, this

Latinos. I don't want any Latinos on this page,

 says the person.  Is that a problem?  I mean, is 

that state action or not state action?

 MR. MOOPPAN: I would think -- if 

that's all there is, I would say it's not 

because a private citizen could set up that 

exact same page.  Here -- this is a page to get 

you access to government officials.

wouldn't -- wouldn't that implicate all the

about whether or not a private citizen is

attributable to the state?  I mean, we don't

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SOPAN JOSHI 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. JOSHI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

We agree with Petitioners that duty 

and authority is the right way to figure out in 

what capacity a -- a public employee defendant 

is acting, but we think the Court should focus 

on the subset of cases involving a denial of 

access to property.

In those cases, if the defendant is

 exercising an official duty to provide access, 

like hosting an official school board meeting, 

of course, that's state action. It doesn't

 matter where it happens.

 But, for other kinds of duties, and

 most important, where it's ambiguous, where it's 

the kind of thing a private citizen could do but 

also within a broad description of the 

official's responsibilities, there, we think the 

nature of the property should be all but 

dispositive.  So, if the defendant denies access 

to government property, probably state action. 

If the defendant denies access to her 

own personal property, she's probably acting in 

her capacity as a private property owner, not as 

an agent of the state.  And that framework, 

especially insofar as it provides a default rule 

for hard cases, we think, is more consistent 

with the state -- with the purposes of the state 

action doctrine, will resolve these cases today 

and others like them, and will avoid the need 

for this Court to set forth a one-size-fits-all 

broader duty and authority test of -- of broader 

applicability.

I welcome the Court's questions but

 happy to talk about --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What exactly is the

 property?  The contract talks about terms of

 services, I guess, with -- I'm not a Facebook

 person, but I -- I assume it -- they would not

 consider this service a property.

 So what exactly is a property?

 MR. JOSHI: Well, I think the 

property, it's a form of virtual property.  But 

it is the account.  You can post speech on 

there. You can have conversations on there. 

You can open it up to -- to everyone or just to 

friends.  It is a form of -- of virtual 

property. 

It's like a virtual -- I -- I hate to 

use the word "forum" because that term is sort 

of overloaded in this context, but it's a --

it's a virtual forum of sorts. 

It's no different from, say, a hotel 

that offers its ballrooms for rent to people and 

you might sign a contract and have terms of 

service.  But, when you take that hotel, you 

have a certain degree of control.  You have one 

of the sticks in the bundle of property sticks

 sort.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So did -- would you 

-- just to follow up, do you think that you have 

to take into consideration the role of the -- of

 the provider, Facebook, too, since they can also

 evict you from this room that you're in or this

MR. JOSHI: Yeah, so not in these 

cases. And I -- I agree that there are some 

really difficult questions as to the extent of 

ownership and control over this virtual property 

as between Facebook and Twitter and Petitioners 

in this case. 

But what should be undisputed and is 

undisputed is that the Poway Unified School 

District has absolutely no ownership or control 

over these pages, and that's the relevant 

question for the state action question in these 

cases. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if -- excuse me.

MR. JOSHI: I think the question in 

these cases is the constitutional one of state

 action.  This Court has often said the 

Constitution deals with substance, not shadows.

 And I think these sorts of appearances are the 

kind of shadows that shouldn't matter to the 

substantive question of whether, to use 

Petitioners' test, you know, it is an actual 

official duty and authority being exercised on 

that property. 

And I think this Court has rejected, 

to the extent Your Honor is invoking reasonable 

observer kind of tests, this Court has rejected 

in a variety of contexts, most recently in the 

Coach Kennedy case. 

I mean, I think maybe to a reasonable 

observer, a lot of people would have thought 

that that coach was acting in his official 

capacity.  But the Court didn't rely on 

reasonable observers.  At least as it saw the 

facts, it said --

 favor of closing down the school.

 So the mayor holds a meeting on -- on

whom they listen to, but, at the end of the day, 

the Constitution does not prohibit even odious

And I want to return here now to a 

point that Mr. Mooppan said, which I really do

 think is maybe one of the most important points 

in this case, which is that a lot of the scare

 hypotheticals that the other side gives about

 public officials behaving badly if you narrow

 the state action doctrine can be taken care of 

by their government employers or by the state

 through statutes. 

The government has employer -- as 

employer has much greater leeway to regulate 

than government as sovereign.  And so this Court 

has decided a number of cases in which 

government employees acting in their private 

capacities can nevertheless be regulated by 

their employers. 

And so, if you're worried that there's 

not a code of conduct for government officials 

on how they comport themselves in their 

personal/private capacities, such a code of 

conduct is better if it comes from the 

government employer as the state.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no, no, no, 

no, no.  I mean, it's -- it's not like --

there's -- there's a duty that says you -- you 

have to announce the road closures.  They're 

just you -- you know, you're in charge of road 

closures, and you think it would be a good idea 

if citizens knew about them, so you're 

announcing the road closures on your site. 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah, and if there's not a 

specific duty to announce the road closure, 

which I gather is what you're saying, then, if 

you choose to do it on your own site, that's 

exactly the sort of thing where we think the

 Mooppan's answer.  Mr. Mooppan said that as long 

as there wasn't a government site where the road 

closures were being announced, that that would

 be state action.

 MR. JOSHI: If there's a duty to

 announce those.  I took as you framed it --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's not a duty to 

announce. You're in charge of road closures and 

you think it would be a very good idea if people 

understood where the road closures were. 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah, and it's -- again, 

I -- I don't want to speak for Mr. Mooppan, but 

that sounds like the kind of thing that a 

private citizen could do. 

Let me give you an example closer to 

the school board case. There are often --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why -- why don't 

we do my example, because how are you going to 

know --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- where the road 

closures are?  I mean, now you're -- you're

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's not a specific

MR. JOSHI: Then --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Duties don't work like

That's your duty, to be in charge of road

MR. JOSHI: And if you are not 

obligated to -- to talk about road closures and 

tell the public about road closures, if you do 

it on your private site, then I think that

personal capacity. 

Now I agree there may be duties to 

inform, and, in those cases, if the only place 

you do it is on your personal site, that may 

well be state action, whereas, if you do it on 

both sites, it wouldn't be.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Sixth Circuit 

seems to think that the duties have to be

 written.  But many duties are customary, 

meaning, no, you're right, I think, if you're in 

charge of road closures, I have very little

 doubt that there's a written law that says you

 must inform the public.  But that is what

 everybody does.  It's what tradition and -- and 

process has always provided for. 

You're suggesting that that would not 

be taken into account? 

MR. JOSHI: No, not at all. Quite the 

opposite.  We agree that customs can define the 

duties.  I think I was just saying --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you don't agree 

with the Sixth Circuit's narrow view that it has 

to be a written duty? 

MR. JOSHI: We do not agree with the 

Sixth Circuit's view that it has to be written 

down. We agree that customs can inform what the 

duties are of an office.  It's just, if there is 

a duty to inform, then the discharge of that 

duty will be state action no matter where it 

takes place.  But where there's doubt about it,

wonderful things that a state government can 

impose in its capacity as an employer.  I don't 

think this Court should impose it as a matter of

where does it cross the line into governmental.

 Why -- why does it matter that it's

 posted on the government site or not?

 MR. JOSHI: I -- I guess the -- it 

would matter because that would inform, just as 

you look at the facts of the case, whether

 you're acting in your personal capacity or in

 your official capacity, which metaphorical hat

 you're wearing.  And if you discharge your duty, 

again, assuming there's a duty to inform the 

public about these things, if you've discharged 

a duty on the official site and then you're 

amplifying it on your personal site, odds are, 

when you do it on your personal site, you're 

doing it in your personal capacity. 

But, if your boss tells you go, you 

know, inform the public about this road closure 

and the only place you do it is on your personal 

site, you're probably discharging your official 

duties. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So it 

sounds like both of you would have in essence a 

safe harbor that if you're reposting information 

on your personal site, that that's probably not 

going to be considered governmental.

take the point that the other side makes that

I think that's better because that is the

preserve an area of individual freedom and not

Kagan's questions about announcements, et 

cetera, if individual posts on a personal site 

can ever be state action because you have a duty 

to make announcements, is that a situation in 

which your property framework or the presumption 

is just defeated because it's a personal account 

and which you sometimes use for official 

purposes?

 state action no matter where you do it. And

 your blocking of someone from accessing that

 particular action is going to be state action no

 matter where it occurs.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But the word "duty" 

is important to you.  So I asked Mr. Mooppan 

about duty and authority.  You -- you're really 

leaning on duty, and it seemed in your 

interchange with Justice Kagan that you saw a 

difference between duty and authority. 

MR. JOSHI: Well, I think a duty --

it's less obvious in these cases and more 

obvious in -- in the next case, where he's a 

subordinate with a supervisor. 

So duty is important because you need 

to know is he actually discharging the thing 

he's supposed to do. An elected official like 

these school board members don't really have 

much in the way of those duties, but they do 

have authority.  They can invoke the state's 

power to do something that someone who doesn't

 controversial policy, and there is no public 

meeting to start because the mayor fears that 

there's going to be quite a bit of acrimony with 

people who want to come out differently than the

 mayor does. 

And so, instead of the public meeting,

 the mayor says privately, I'm going to hold --

have a meeting on my farm, or maybe he even 

announces the meeting, but we're only letting in 

people who are likely to agree with my view. 

Same result?  No state action in that situation? 

MR. JOSHI: I think probably no state 

action in that situation.  I think it's 

something that government officials actually do 

all the time.  They might not want to meet with 

even their own constituents who disagree with 

them. They might speak only to Democratic Party 

meetings and only take feedback from Democratic 

Party donors.  And, you know, the solution for 

that, as I said, for elected officials might be 

the voters.

 feedback from the public?  If -- if there was a

understand you to be saying that he would have

 to. 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah, I --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  That even if it was

MR. JOSHI: I -- I -- I think it would 

have to be a pretty specific duty for that to 

constitute state action.  I think, if the duty 

is too broad in general, like speak to 

constituents, I think that's exactly the kind of 

case that our heuristic, our test, has a lot of 

purchase, which is, if it's something that a 

private citizen can do, talk about a policy, get 

views on a policy, advocate for a policy, but

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  One 

final question just as a sort of theoretical 

matter. Does the government have any concern

 about the potential privatization of government

 functions that could occur?  I mean, I suppose 

I'm a little worried about city mayors deciding 

to sort of shape the debate of the people in

 their community by having their meetings in --

in private places so that others in the 

community can't comment. 

Do -- that -- that seems to me 

problematic as sort of a theoretical matter, but 

the government, I'm taking, says as long as the 

mayor chooses to do this on private property, 

then he can exclude whoever he wants because 

he's doing it in his personal capacity? 

MR. JOSHI: Yeah, I mean, in the 

brick-and-mortar world, I'm not aware of this 

being a problem.  And if it is a problem, I 

think it's best handled by the state, which can 

regulate its employees in ways that a state as 

sovereign cannot.  And I think that's the best 

place to handle those concerns, not a rule of 

conduct from this Court as a matter of federal

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. KARLAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court: 

I have three points to make.  First, 

the district court found as a factual finding 

based on Petitioners' own testimony that 

"receiving feedback from constituents is an 

important part of their duties as trustees." 

California law, both decisional and 

constitutional and statutory, the PUSD bylaws, 

to which I'll return in a moment, and the 

content and appearance of the page confirms that 

the finding -- the district court's finding that 

these pages were "used as a tool of governance." 

Because the trustees were doing their job when 

they maintained and then blocked Dr. and 

Mrs. Garnier from these pages, this case fits 

comfortably within this Court's declaration in 

West and Lugar that state employment is

generally sufficient to render the defendant a

 state actor.

 Second, the record in the district

 court contains O'Connor-Ratcliff's entire 

Facebook feed from the time she joined the --

the board through summary judgment.  Of the 

hundreds of posts, I found only three that were

 truly non-job-related.  Not only were the posts 

all related to her job as PUSD trustee, but the 

district court found that the content of many of 

the posts was possible only because, as a 

trustee, she was, in the district court's words, 

"clothed with the authority of state law." 

For example, O'Connor-Ratcliff's 

official position was why she could enter into 

classrooms during instructional time all over 

the district, something that would get anybody 

who was a private citizen arrested.  Not only 

did she use these pages to provide information 

about her official activities that was available 

nowhere else, but she frequently solicited 

feedback from the public on board-related issues 

and used the word "we" to do so. 

And I'd like to direct the Court to

protection, so, for example, there are a number 

of protections that go to government officials 

when they speak in their official capacity, plus 

they still have all of the First Amendment

 And I think it's really important to

 note here that all we're talking about is the

 state action issue.  And the idea that 

government officials are not going to want to

not sure about that.  I mean, if it's a -- if 

it's characterized as a state action 

governmental site, then -- I -- wouldn't 

anything they say be categorized as governmental 

speech on which the government could take a 

particular political, social, whatever, view? 

MS. KARLAN: Well, I think that it's 

actually perhaps a little more complicated than 

that, Mr. Chief Justice, because these are 

elected officials, and part of their duty is to 

talk about certain issues.

And I think, if the government told 

them they're simply not allowed to talk about

 their position on what the board is taking or

 the like, that itself would violate at least the 

California constitution and arguably the federal

 Constitution as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just 

-- just to make sure I understand, you're --

 we're characterizing a particular site as 

whether it's governmental, a source of 

governmental authority or, you know, operated as 

a governmental duty, or private. 

Now, if it's private, the people 

talking on it can say what they want.  Their 

speech won't be limited.  If it's governmental 

speech, you know, they have to do what the 

government tells them to do on that site. 

MS. KARLAN: Well, I think the one 

thing that they do have to do, and I think this 

is fair, and there were a number of questions of 

the folks representing the Petitioners here, 

they do have to have a disclaimer here to say 

this is a personal site. 

They did not have this disclaimer.

sympathetic to the mayor's program, but with 

somebody who is a known opponent approaches the 

mayor, the mayor says, look, please call my

 MS. KARLAN: I -- I think the answer 

to that question, which is, I think, different 

than the answer I would give in our case, is

 that when they're clearly off duty, that is, you 

know, pushing the shopping cart down the aisle,

 arguably, they're not doing their job.

 But, when they create an ongoing site 

like the site here, they maintain a forum, if 

you will on -- in which people can comment and 

people can talk to each other, they're not just 

talking to the mayor, then, yes, that would be 

state action. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, elected 

officials have told me they're always on call. 

They're always doing their job. They're always 

being approached by constituents. 

MS. KARLAN: But, if they say they're 

doing their job, then, yes, I would say the 

starting point is they're state actors. 

Now can they say, I don't want to talk 

to you right now, you know, the ice cream is 

melting?  Of course, they can, because that's 

not violating somebody's First Amendment rights.

 And if you compare this to her

uses "we."  And, honestly, as Mark Twain said,

Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I agree with

 you on duty.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They require a 

written law on duty.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the government

 has already conceded that you can't look just to 

written law.  So let's take Justice Barrett's 

point that authority is doing most of the work 

and authority has a meaning.  So go ahead. 

MS. KARLAN: So, as I read authority 

in both the government's brief and the Sixth 

Circuit, they're treating authority as you're 

exercising some coercive control over a member 

of the public. 

I take authority to be something quite 

different than that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give me a --

MS. KARLAN: So -- so the -- the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're going to 

have to explain that better.

what the government says is, well, of course, 

even if you're using private property, if you're 

using it to coerce somebody, so on your private

 website, you said to somebody:  You're fired,

 and that -- and -- and that has the force of 

law, that would be state action because you're

 using an authority that only you have.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  But --

MS. KARLAN: Right.  I -- I as a --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but they --

they --

MS. KARLAN: -- private citizen do 

not. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- admit that 

notice-and-comment would not be coercing 

someone, so --

MS. KARLAN: No, but I -- I mean, I --

I -- I take it what they're talking about there 

is a particular kind of authority.  Now some of 

the posts here are because of her authority as a 

state actor.  The modal post on the site, I 

would say, the thing that is most common on the 

site, is that she goes and visits a classroom 

with the superintendent or with a -- a -- a 

principal during instructional time.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just if I could 

get you to say that in one bit, if you said, you

 know, the right way to think about duty and 

authority if you want to use those words is

 what? 

MS. KARLAN: The right way to think 

about duty is to look at the various -- various 

sources of state law that tell you what 

somebody's duty is.  And, here, we've got the 

California constitution, the board bylaws --

MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  How is that true?  Why

 is that true?

 MS. KARLAN: Because the Sixth Circuit 

says, unless there's an affirmative command that

 obligates you to do the specific thing you are 

doing in the specific form you are doing it,

 you're not doing your duty.

 And we think that duty has a much 

broader conception.  And I want to be clear --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which is what? 

MS. KARLAN: Which is you look to what 

does state law tell you what to do, what does 

history and tradition tell you what to do, what 

do the bylaws of your organization tell you to 

do? If there's a handbook, what does the 

handbook tell you to do? 

And those things can be optional. 

They can be acting in your discretion. This 

Court has repeatedly said in a number of 

different contexts, going back to the MacDaniel 

case in 1833, if you're talking about really 

people with -- with important government jobs, 

it's not all going to be written down.

MS. KARLAN: Yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm 

a little confused as to what's at stake here

 because I hear you saying now it isn't a matter 

of appearances and whether a reasonable person 

might make a mistake, which was kind of the

 Ninth Circuit's reasoning.  It really does boil 

down to duties and authorities. 

And you -- you -- you -- you're 

positing that those duties and authorities 

include beyond what's in a handbook and must 

take account of custom.  But I had understood 

the Solicitor General to say exactly the same 

thing. So are we coalescing around a test that 

everybody more or less agrees on? 

MS. KARLAN: Well, I want to be very 

clear. I was talking about duties and 

authorities in the context of Justice Barrett's 

question.  We think that the appearance and 

function are also relevant to whether someone is 

engaged in state action.

about three or four cases where the question was 

whether a government official was a state actor,

 and in all of those cases except Polk County

 against Dodson, which was a case about public 

defenders, the Court said, of course, you're a 

-- you're a state actor if you're a government

 official.

 So I think the presumptions and the 

rules of thumb and the like operate a little bit 

differently here than they would operate in a 

case that involved someone who was clearly just 

a private actor and you're asking, are you --

can you push them over the line into being a 

state actor? 

Here, we start with somebody who looks 

like a state actor, says email me on my 

government official account if you've got any 

questions, says I -- this is the official page 

of me, uses the photo and the like.  And I do 

think all of that helps.

 concerned about -- about the test. And I 

understand you to have said that you would

 define "duty" to include custom, a

 well-established custom.

 And is it not a well-established 

custom for any elected public official to inform 

constituents about what he or she is doing? So, 

if that's how you understand "duty," then are 

you not saying that anything that a -- an 

elected public official, let's leave it at that, 

tells constituents about what that person is 

doing falls -- constitutes state action? 

MS. KARLAN: I think the starting 

point is, yes, they could rebut that.  For 

example, talking -- you know, at Thanksgiving 

dinner, somebody says, pass the gravy, and you 

say, and I also passed a -- a bill last month. 

Yes, that would be --

(Laughter.) 

MS. KARLAN: -- that would be private, 

whereas -- whereas, when you set up -- and this 

is what the -- this is what the Ninth Circuit 

says on page 28a of the Pet. App., is the state 

action here is maintaining an ongoing site for 

the -- for the exchange of information.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand

 that, but what I'm -- my -- my -- what I'm 

getting from this is that you have taken the --

the Sixth Circuit's test and the Petitioners' 

test and you have broadened it by defining

 custom -- by defining "duty" so broadly.  And

 maybe this is right.  But you have made it into 

a very broad test, a very inclusive test.

 MS. KARLAN: I think, if you want to 

use the words that the Sixth Circuit used as 

your guidance, you have to broaden, and our case 

would clearly fall on the side of --

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If you're -- if 

you're the White House press secretary and you 

have a dinner at your house and you invite over 

certain members of the press and not other 

members of the press because part of what you 

think makes you a good press secretary is to get 

feedback and develop good relations with members 

of the media, is that state action? 

MS. KARLAN: Can I take that question 

and -- and kind of flip it around and go 

backwards into it?  There would be no 

constitutional claim by anybody, no meritorious 

constitutional claim that they have a right to 

come to your dinner. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, someone 

who's excluded on the basis of viewpoint, so 

you're inviting friendly reporters or who you 

perceive to be friendly reporters.

 regular meeting, no -- no food is served, but a 

regular meeting offsite, so not at the White

MS. KARLAN: I think the members of 

the press put us in a somewhat different 

position because already you're entitled to 

limit that in a variety of ways. But, if you 

had a public meeting -- for example, in 

California, a lot of our elected representatives 

have what they call sidewalk office hours, and 

they'll sit in the bank parking lot next to the 

farmers' market and they'll talk to anybody and 

they'll hand out stuff. 

If they decided simply because they 

were sitting on the bank's parking -- bank's 

parking lot instead of in their office, I'm not 

talking to black people, I'm not talking to 

Muslims, I'm not talking to evangelicals, yes, 

they'd be engaged in state action, and, yes,

 MS. KARLAN: Well, the appearance is 

really helpful in figuring out what is the

 function.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So the -- it boils 

down to the function in your mind?

 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.

 MS. KARLAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the function is 

sort of another word for duty in your sense, 

like a duty is a responsibility, is a function? 

They're all kind of tied up together? 

MS. KARLAN: Yeah.  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, your -- your 

duty is to do your job and that's your function. 

MS. KARLAN: And when you do your job, 

you're doing the function of -- of -- of being a 

trustee of the Poway School District.

to this is all a question of how broadly do we 

define "authority" or "duty"?

MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- then is the nub 

of the case as you see it?

 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  The case totally

 boils down to how you define it?

 And I asked the other side a bunch of 

questions about what work does duty do. It's 

all an authority. I think you would say, if I 

understand your position correctly, it's just 

about authority, we're not really looking at 

duties? 

MS. KARLAN: No, we are looking at 

duty. That's exactly what I'm trying to say, is 

duty -- are you performing the duty of your job 

as a trustee?  If you are, then you are 

presumptively a state actor.  That's what the 

Court's statements in West and Lugar turn --

turn to.  So --

MS. KARLAN: No, I would say having

 And the board bylaws say this.  They 

say in Bylaw 9010(a) the responsibility of board

participate in public discourse, and then they 

say board members have a responsibility to 

identify personal viewpoints as such and not as

And, here, what you have is -- the --

both of the Petitioners using "we" and "our"

This is an official website.  It looks like an

back to the question that Justice Kavanaugh was

 asking.  How does that matter or does it matter?

 MS. KARLAN: I -- I don't think it 

would matter if it was the website at issue 

here. And I really do urge you to take a look 

at ECF 3511, which has the entire feed from the 

day she took office until the day of the summary

 judgment motion. 

And I defy anyone to look at that and 

think this wasn't an official website.  Indeed, 

when she wants to give you her personal opinion, 

she sends you a link to her campaign website. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I take it that 

this is the crucial difference between you and 

the government, right, that they just say 

Facebook says it's her private property? 

MS. KARLAN: Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so it's not an 

official website by definition.

duty to communicate with constituents, give

 announcements, et cetera, but she decides, hey,

 constituent communication would be a good idea. 

This is the kind of like, well, the governor 

decides to do this, or the president decides to

 do this.

 Is that not, even if it's not formally 

in her job description, and even if she's the 

first one to do it, so it's not custom, but we 

would say she has the authority to decide to be 

a mouthpiece for government. 

Would you agree that that would be a 

test? 

MS. KARLAN: Yeah.  I -- I -- I -- if 

I can just say, it's a little complicated in our 

case because the board has specifically said she 

doesn't have the authority to speak for the 

board and that's why she's supposed to have a 

disclaimer. 

But, if you're talking about a 

hypothetical of someone in another jurisdiction

way and she decides she has the authority, then

 Now most government workers, most

And the answer here is the Poway School District 

told her not to do this, told her not to have a 

website that looked as if she was speaking

 officially, and this website did exactly that.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Just on the custom

 question, to follow up on Justice Barrett, it's 

usually I think, as you're describing it, going 

to be part of the custom of most of these jobs 

that are elected officials or appointed 

officials who have some authority to communicate 

with constituents. 

MS. KARLAN: I don't think that that's 

necessarily true at all. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  When wouldn't it 

be true? 

MS. KARLAN: It will be true for 

elected officials.  It will be true for some 

government officials, but let me give you a 

hypothetical that I think will illustrate this. 

So, if a public school teacher in 

Poway had a website that was communicating with 

the parents of children in her class, that would 

clearly be state action, and I think that would 

be true regardless of what she called the

things like whether the board should be elected 

at large or by districts, which was a big issue 

here, or she wanted to talk about whether the

 something that for a while there was a real 

problem, that would be her speaking in her 

personal capacity because that wouldn't be 

coming from her job and her duties as a -- as a 

school teacher. 

So just to kind of wrap up, I think --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think -- this 

is -- a little bit anticipates the next case. 

If there were also some personal things on this 

site, how far does that take you?  Can you 

dilute the site and turn it into non-state 

action by putting up your kids' pictures? 

MS. KARLAN: I don't think one picture 

of your children turns something into not a 

state website.  Here, I really do think, if you 

look at this website, you will find one picture 

of her children on Christmas, one picture of her 

children at some school-related event, one 

picture of her grandfather at -- on Veterans

Day, and nothing else that is personal, that is 

clearly personal as opposed to coming out of her

 job.

 You know, here's the thing to 

understand, and this goes back to something that 

Justice Kagan said earlier, which is there are

 First Amendment issues on both sides of this

 case. And, here, the First Amendment provides a 

tremendous backstop for members of school boards 

and the like who want to regulate their sites. 

There are rules about public forums, 

there are rules about time, place, and manner 

and the like, and they have a lot of control 

over what goes on on these websites. 

But, if you decide the threshold state 

action question against my clients here, 

refusing to have -- find state action would have 

devastating consequences for the -- for the 

public because they would be denied access to 

the sites on which their officials are talking 

to them and asking for their reactions.

Justice Alito?

 Justice Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In some ways,

 you've complicated things.

 MS. KARLAN: I'm sorry.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, really, 

because what we're being asked to find is 

whether the state was acting when these 

government officials turned off these sites. 

So we're being asked to hold the state 

responsible for ultra vires activities because 

these officials were told specifically you're 

telling us now don't do this and they did it 

anyway. 

MS. KARLAN:  No, ma'am.  Just as in --

and we talk about this in -- in the red brief --

in Monell, the Court said you can't hold the 

government responsible, the municipal government 

responsible, unless the unconstitutional action 

was pursuant to a policy. 

But there was nonetheless a 

constitutional tort there for which individual 

government actors could be held responsible. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay, thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. MOOPPAN: Thank you, Your Honor. 

So, first, on the appearance question, 

I -- you know, I think my friend said appearance 

is relevant in assessing whether there's duty or 

authority but basically gave up the notion that 

the Ninth Circuit adopted that you can use 

appearance as a freestanding trump over duty and 

authority.  I think that concession is basically 

right because, otherwise -- the power to block 

doesn't come from the appearance, and I think 

she would have to concede my hypothetical where 

the police officer runs down the street in his 

uniform is not state action.

So then I think the action really does

 come to, how do we define "duty" and

 "authority"?  And I think the fundamental 

problem with Ms. Karlan's submission is that

 she's defining it too broadly.  She's doing 

exactly what this Court said in Kennedy, in

 Lane, you should not do, because you have to

 recognize that government officials have the 

right to speak in their personal capacity about 

their jobs. 

That's even true with -- about 

information they only learned because of their 

jobs. Ms. Karlan emphasized several times that 

my client spoke about stuff they learned in the 

classroom.  That's this Court's decision in 

Lane. The square holding of Lane was that it 

was individual speech, not citizen -- employee 

speech, even though it was information learned 

while in office. 

And the flip side of that problem is 

that if you treat this too broadly, the problem 

that this Court recognized in both Kennedy and 

Garcetti, and the Chief Justice adverted to 

this, if you treat this as duty and authority 

just because you're talking about your jobs,

that means it's controlled by the state.  It

 amounts to government speech, which means the 

state itself could tell individuals what to say

 on their pages.

 And that's the harm with creating this 

sort of you have to have a disclaimer rule. If

 client -- if individuals don't put up a 

disclaimer, all of a sudden, not only do they 

lose their right to exclude people from their 

pages, they have now opened themselves up to 

having the state itself tell them what to say on 

their page, not as a regulation, because I agree 

with the federal government that the state has a 

lot of power to regulate them as employees, but 

Ms. Karlan's position means that they could 

regulate them as such. They could tell them 

exactly what to do or say on the page.  And that 

would be a serious First Amendment problem, and 

to say that the First Amendment does all of that 

because they didn't put up a disclaimer would, I 

think, turn the First Amendment on its head. 

Finally, a few points about the facts 

of my case because I too would like to win for 

my clients. 

(Laughter.)

MR. MOOPPAN: So the -- the -- the

 first point I'll make is that if -- this is laid 

out in our reply brief -- if you look through 

the citations to the record, the only duty that 

my clients had to interact with the public was 

at their board meetings, which they complied

 with, and no one was ever blocked from that.

 Everything else is the same sort of 

overbroad, "it's your duty to talk to people," 

that would cover campaign rallies, talking to 

your neighbors at church, the stuff that cannot 

possibly be viewed as governmental unless you 

swallow individuals' -- individual First 

Amendment rights. 

The last -- she suggested that the 

page was somehow their duty. One of my clients 

closed the page, just shut it down.  No one 

thinks he was acting in breach of his office, he 

was in dereliction of duty. 

Your Honor, I see my time is up. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Thank 

you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the case 

was submitted.)
