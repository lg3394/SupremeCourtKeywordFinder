 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-913, Devillier versus

 Texas.

 Mr. McNamara.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. McNAMARA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. McNAMARA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The Question Presented in this case is 

resolved by the text of the Fifth Amendment, 

which, unlike any other provision of the 

Constitution, imposes on the government a -- an 

explicit duty to pay money. 

It's also answered by this Court's 

decision in First English, which holds that the 

just compensation remedy is mandatory and that 

the Fifth Amendment itself furnishes a basis on 

which a court can award just compensation in an 

inverse condemnation case. 

And this right of property owners to 

sue in inverse condemnation to obtain just 

compensation for an alleged taking is at the 

heart of modern American takings law.  It's at

the heart of inverse condemnation claims filed 

against state and local governments nationwide. 

And it's also at the heart of every takings 

claim filed against the federal government under

 the Tucker Act.

 The Tucker Act provides no cause of 

action, no substantive entitlement to a remedy. 

The cause of action, the substantive entitlement 

to a remedy, in every Tucker Act takings case is 

the self-executing Fifth Amendment, the same 

cause of action recognized in First English, the 

same cause of action pled here. 

To reject that cause of action now is 

to upend the way lower courts, both state and 

federal, understand the Takings Clause to work 

and also to abandon this Court's consistent 

explanations of that clause not just in First 

English but in more recent cases like Knick 

v. Township of Scott. 

And there's no reason to make that 

kind of drastic change. This Court has already 

recognized that money-mandating legal 

obligations logically come along with the right 

to file a lawsuit to enforce those obligations. 

That's true as to statutes, which is

what this Court held in Maine Community Health

 Options.  It should be at least as true as to 

the Constitution, and this Court's precedents 

consistently teach that it is.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  In your reply brief, 

you say that the 19th century federal courts 

were faced with a bedrock property right and no 

way to enforce it directly. 

Doesn't that seem to be at odds -- the 

fact that the courts there had to resort to 

extra-constitutional causes of action, isn't 

that at odds with your argument now? 

MR. McNAMARA:  I don't think so, Your 

Honor, because the primary problem facing 

federal courts in the early part of the 19th 

century was a lack of jurisdiction.  And I think 

the question of jurisdiction is just 

conceptually distinct from the question of 

whether there's a cause of action, whether 

there's a right to a remedy. 

Congress could tomorrow amend 

Section 1331 to reimpose an 

amount-in-controversy limit, and if it did that, 

that would prevent a number of people from

 bringing Ex parte Young actions in federal

 court. Those claims wouldn't cease to exist. 

Congress would just have eliminated the

 jurisdiction over them.

 And so I think there's a difference

 between jurisdictional limits which limited 

takings claims and even pleading requirements 

like the limits to the forms of action, which 

also limited plaintiffs' abilities to bring 

certain kinds of claims, and the core Question 

Presented here, which is just whether there is 

an entitlement to relief. 

There -- there's only one modern form 

of action, which just takes the shape of saying, 

I'm entitled to this remedy for that reason. 

The remedy is just compensation. The reason is 

the Fifth Amendment as applied through the 

Fourteenth.  And once the jurisdictional 

problems and the pleading problems are removed, 

as they have been in this case, the only 

question remains whether the Fifth Amendment 

mandates compensation, whether it mandates that 

remedy, which this Court has already answered. 

First English says that the just compensation 

remedy is mandatory.

And I think contrasting the -- the 

arguments of the other side with the rule 

adopted by the California Supreme Court in Agins

 is actually a useful illustration here. The 

California Supreme Court's decision in Agins 

said, we as a common law court don't want to

 recognize a claim for just compensation in a

 regulatory takings case.  We think that intrudes

 on the legislature's prerogative.  We don't 

recognize that cause of action. 

And First English says that doesn't 

matter.  The cause of action, the entitlement to 

relief, flows directly from the Fifth Amendment. 

So too here.  The complaint here pleads a cause 

of action directly under the Fifth Amendment --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel --

MR. McNAMARA:  -- that says our 

property was taken and the Fifth Amendment --

yes, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, I agree 

that jurisdiction and a cause of action are 

distinct, but it's a little bit hard to see how 

in 1791 -- I mean, I think your argument is, 

when the Fifth Amendment was ratified, those who 

ratified it had to see the Fifth Amendment as

right, the right to just compensation.

 But Congress didn't provide for 

federal question jurisdiction until 1875, so 

that kind of languished on the vine for a pretty 

long time if you're right that the founding

 generation or the -- you know, the ratifying

 generation in 1791 viewed it that way. 

Moreover, you know, the historical 

evidence of private bills runs contrary to your 

argument because, yes, there was a right to just 

compensation, but we have all of this time, 

throughout the 19th century, of Congress 

enacting private bills to give just 

compensation. 

And I think you have to contend with 

that because, I mean, I get that this is against 

Texas, against the state, but if the Fourteenth 

Amendment incorporated the Fifth Amendment as it 

was, there's kind of a mountain of historical 

evidence, you know, that you've got to contend 

with. 

MR. McNAMARA:  So I -- I don't think 

that mountain does quite the work that Texas

needs it to, Your Honor. And I think one 

problem here is the difficulty in mapping the 

modern conception of cause of action onto 1791

 visions of the court.  I think, if you asked a

 lawyer in 1791 whether the Fifth Amendment 

contained a cause of action, they probably 

wouldn't understand the question.

 But, if you asked them can a property

 owner sue to enforce just compensation, the 

answer absolutely would have been yes. It would 

have been a suit in trespass.  It would perhaps 

have been a suit in ejectment.  But there was an 

understanding at the framing that this was an 

enforceable right, and if you --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that -- that 

establishes at most, it seems to me, that the 

Fifth Amendment envisioned some remedial 

mechanism would be available.  And the common 

law trespass, as you point out, might have been 

it, or conversion might have been it. It -- it 

doesn't necessarily mean that there is itself an 

independent cause of action under the Fifth 

Amendment.

Your Honor, once the forms --

conceded that the cause of action that -- that 

the Framers would have understood would have

 been in trespass. 

MR. McNAMARA:  Well, Your Honor, I

 means when it says "cause of action" --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, no. But what

 we're talking about the original meaning, and 

you're asking us to appeal to the original 

meaning and say they would have understood there 

would have been a cause of action.  Perhaps, but 

what would that cause of action look like? 

MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I think they would 

have understood that there was an entitlement to 

a remedy. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Some remedy? 

MR. McNAMARA:  An entitlement to just 

compensation as a remedy. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Some -- some way to 

get that? 

MR. McNAMARA: Yes, and I think --

 understand that argument.  That's not the

 argument you're -- you're pressing, though.

 MR. McNAMARA:  That's because, here,

 compensation hasn't been paid.  The plaintiffs 

in this case continue to suffer the ongoing

 Fifth Amendment injury.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, maybe that's 

because you -- you -- you -- you allowed this 

case to be removed, which I -- and -- and --

and, you know, I'm -- I'm surprised you didn't 

oppose removal on that ground and said there's 

no federal question that we need to resolve here 

because it's really a state common law cause of 

action we're pursuing.  That would have been one 

option. 

Or maybe in federal court you might 

have said we want a declaratory judgment, which 

everyone concedes you can get under the Fifth 

Amendment, and take pendent jurisdiction over 

our state common law cause of action, which 

would adequately vindicate our Fifth Amendment 

rights.

courses here.

 mechanism to vindicate the Fifth Amendment, but 

there is no Texas decision saying we sitting as 

a common law court invoke our common law powers

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No trespass, no

MR. McNAMARA:  Texas hears inverse 

condemnation claims arising under the Fifth 

Amendment.  That's what the Texas Supreme Court

It doesn't invoke its common law powers.

all of that now.  All right.  Now that's 

clarifying.  But you -- you -- the -- the nature 

of the argument before us isn't that Texas lacks 

a common law cause of action.  It's whether or 

not Texas has such a thing, we're entitled to 

another remedy under federal law.

the Fifth Amendment doesn't state a claim, that

 that claim is dead.  If --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let -- let -- let --

 let's suppose you -- we -- it did create a cause

 of action.  Would -- would it also waive

 sovereign immunity?  And what would the statute

 MR. McNAMARA:  I -- it -- it wouldn't 

necessarily waive sovereign immunity, Your

the statute of limitations would be the statute 

of limitations that is applied by lower courts 

when people actually bring these claims. 

There's a -- a robust Court of Federal 

Claims jurisprudence, federal district courts 

hear claims arising under the Fifth Amendment, 

sometimes looking to state law to set the 

statute of limitations. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Ah, they look to 

state law, don't they, yeah? 

MR. McNAMARA:  But the claim itself,

just in Texas but in states nationwide.  And I 

think this is an important point.

compensation for takings under the Fifth

 Amendment is the Oregon courts, citing First

 English, have said it must pay just

 compensation.  And so answering the Question

 Presented --

JUSTICE BARRETT: If we don't read 

First English the way you do -- I mean, I think 

that footnote's pretty difficult to decipher --

do you lose? 

MR. McNAMARA:  No, Your Honor. 

I would -- I don't think it's just the footnote 

in First English.  I think it's the broader 

holding that the remedy is required. 

But I think there's no dispute here 

that there is an entitlement to relief.  And, 

certainly, by the time of the ratification of 

the Fourteenth Amendment, courts across the 

country had converged on how that kind of 

entitlement would be enforced. 

And it's enforced by a lawsuit 

directly against the entity that took the 

property that takes the form of saying, you have

 order you to fulfill it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I have a --

just a small point of information?  Your case 

was dismissed in federal court. Did you ask for 

a remand on your claims under the Texas

 Constitution?

 MR. McNAMARA:  No, Your Honor.  The 

district court is keeping pendent jurisdiction 

over the claims under the Texas cause. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you -- you have 

a pending suit on the state law claim? 

MR. McNAMARA:  Yes, Your Honor, but 

there is a dispute about the scope of the 

takings law that governs that question.  Texas 

has taken the position in the lower courts that 

the Texas Constitution has a narrower definition 

of what counts as a taking than the federal 

courts. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then First 

English comes in too because First English was 

about a state court claim and when it started, 

whether a temporary claim was a taking or not, 

and we said yes, it's a taking, and so the state

 How is it different than First English

 MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I don't think it's

that, here, it was removed into federal court

 was dismissed on the merits.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, I -- I -- I --

I don't disagree with you, but First English is 

about what the substantive law of Texas is and 

what Texas has to pay.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just ask --

I -- I mean, this is similar to what -- what

 Justice Sotomayor was just getting into.  Are --

are you saying that we don't have three separate

 concepts, right, remedy, and cause of action?  I

 thought those were three different things, and 

perhaps First English only covered two of them? 

MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I'm not sure 

they're distinct concepts, Your Honor.  I think 

the simplest way to understand cause of action 

is an entitlement to a particular remedy, which 

is why it's coherent to say someone might have a 

cause of action for an injunction. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I thought it had to 

do with the forum, that you have a cause of 

action that is recognized in the judicial forum 

as opposed to, say, going to the legislature 

through -- through private bills. 

MR. McNAMARA:  Well, Your Honor, I --

I think, to the extent that's the definition of 

"cause of action," we would have a cause of 

action under the clear import of the history

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Not -- not the

 history.  I guess I'm just trying to understand,

 is there -- does it make sense to think about

 the Fifth Amendment as providing the right and 

the remedy but not speaking to where you're 

going to get that remedy from or what is the

 enforcement mechanism? 

That's how I sort of am 

conceptualizing this, and -- and I think we 

differ about that, so I'd like to hear your 

opinion on it. 

MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I'm not sure 

that's a correct reading of the Fifth Amendment, 

Your Honor, in part because I think that reading 

-- everyone agrees there are some judicial 

remedies for the Fifth Amendment. 

As I understand my friend's argument, 

we'd be entitled to sue for injunctive relief or 

for ejectment in the absence of a -- a path to a 

Fifth Amendment compensation remedy. 

So everyone agrees there's some 

judicial remedy, and I think the form of that 

judicial remedy depends on the scope of the 

government's obligation.

There are two visions of the Fifth

 Amendment.  One is that the Fifth Amendment just

 provides a precondition.  The government is

 required to pay and it can be enjoined from 

taking the property if it doesn't pay.

 The other vision that's adopted in 

First English that's reiterated in Knick is that 

the Fifth Amendment creates an obligation to pay 

just compensation. And if that's the ongoing 

obligation, the government has taken property, 

it owes just compensation today, will owe just 

compensation tomorrow, courts are empowered to 

cure that ongoing obligation. 

It's not a question of damages for a 

past violation.  It's a question of the 

government's obligation as it stands in court 

today. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. McNamara, can I 

go back to Justice Sotomayor's question and just 

ask for a point of clarification?  I understood 

Texas law to provide a cause of action for 

vitiating the federal Fifth Amendment right.

Sotomayor to be saying that Texas courts say --

 So am I wrong in thinking that Texas 

allows you to bring a state cause of action for 

the federal Fifth Amendment claim?

 MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I'm not sure 

whether that's right to be honest, Your Honor.

 And I think two things flow from this.  One, if

 it's true that there is a Texas common law cause

 of action under which we could have -- we can 

vindicate our Fifth Amendment rights, then the 

Fifth Circuit still has to be reversed because 

it held that that substantive claim should be 

dismissed on the merits. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Well, let me 

just -- just -- just -- it's important for me to 

be able to understand this procedural point. 

Does Texas have -- provide a state cause of 

action to vitiate the state takings right from 

the Texas Constitution? 

MR. McNAMARA:  Yes, Your Honor.

 isn't trying to discriminate against the -- this

 federal claim.  What Texas says, like other

 state courts, is it's not doing -- it doesn't 

say we're doing common law analysis and creating 

a cause of action.

 What Texas seems to be doing is

 constitutional analysis, just like the other 

state courts that specifically cite First 

English and say, ah, there is a cause of cause 

of action here.  I'm not familiar with any state 

case saying we are using our powers as a common 

law court to create a cause of action to 

vindicate the Fifth Amendment. 

What they say is we're looking at the 

Fifth Amendment.  We see it creates the 

obligation.  Frequently they cite First English 

directly and they say that's what gives rise to 

the cause of action. 

And that, I think, is what's dangerous 

about the Question Presented here.  As -- as I 

understand Texas's argument, the complaint we 

filed in state court was perfectly valid and 

could be adjudicated, and the Fifth Amendment 

could have been adjudicated in state court. 

Once it was removed, Texas moved to dismiss and

 Texas's arguments and say: Okay.  We were 

wrong. The Constitution does not, in fact, 

require a remedy.  There is no federal 

constitutional cause of action.  And that would 

eliminate the federal takings remedy in state 

courts across the nation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. McDowell, the 

language of the Takings Clause is quite similar 

to the language of the Due Process Clause in the 

Fifth Amendment, which immediately precedes it. 

"No person shall be [...] deprived of life, 

liberty, or property, without due process of 

law; nor shall private property be taken for 

public use, without just compensation." 

So why should they be read differently 

with respect to the creation of a cause of 

action?

MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I don't think they

 have to be read differently, Your Honor.  I

 think, if there's an ongoing due process 

violation, a plaintiff could bring an Ex parte

 Young action.  Ex parte Young was not a 1983

 action.  It was --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, not an Ex parte 

Young, but a claim for damages?

 MR. McNAMARA:  Well, and I think 

that's the difference here, that we're not 

seeking damages; we're seeking just 

compensation.  We're not saying there was a past 

completed violation of the Constitution and we 

want something to offset that.  We're saying the 

government has taken property, which gives rise 

to a present duty to pay just compensation, and 

we want the present obligation enforced, not a 

backwards-looking damages remedy concocted or 

created.  And I think that entitlement to just 

compensation is how the Framers would have 

understood the Fifth Amendment. 

The alternative view, the idea that 

all you get are injunctions, I don't think 

squares with either the text or how contemporary 

commentators talked about the clause.

St. George Tucker and John Jay wrote

 about the Takings Clause in the context of the

 Army seizing horses and military supplies.  But, 

if the Army is seizing horses, the Army's going 

to get the horses. The understanding would not 

have been that you could stop the Army in the 

moment from seizing your horses.

 What St. George Tucker is writing

 about is the ongoing duty to provide 

compensation for the horses, which is also how 

contemporary courts wrote about the just 

compensation requirement, even constrained as 

they were by the forms of action. 

I -- I think a great example of this 

is the Massachusetts Supreme Court's decision in 

-- excuse me -- the Massachusetts Supreme 

Court's decision in evaluating an -- an action 

brought as a -- a writ of debt in Gedney v. 

Inhabitants of Tewksbury, where the justices --

the judges of the Massachusetts Supreme Court 

there said:  This isn't the right forum.  This 

isn't an action in debt.  You can't state it 

using that forum.  You have to go to a different 

forum to get your just compensation.  But, if 

that other forum denies you compensation, you

sense to view the Fifth Amendment as providing a 

right to sue for compensation, but your ability 

to vindicate that right is totally dependent on 

Congress's discretionary choice to create lower 

federal courts and to give them jurisdiction to

 entertain such claims?  That sounds like a very

 weak right if that's -- if it's subject to

 limitation in that way. 

MR. McNAMARA: I think the same could 

be said of the entire Bill of Rights, though, 

Your Honor.  The -- the entire stratum of 

federal constitutional rights depends on 

Congress to create lower federal courts, courts 

where these rights can be vindicated. 

Once Congress does create those 

courts, and when a state defendant deliberately 

chooses to avail itself of those courts, the 

only question is whether that court can enforce 

the ongoing obligation to require the payment of 

just compensation. 

And I think that's ultimately what 

distinguishes this case from the Court's Bivens 

cases, where Bivens cases are about the policy 

question of whether to create a remedy.  They 

don't engage in constitutional text, history,

 Rehnquist could dissent in cases like Carlson v.

 Green and Davis v. Passman and then, less than a 

decade later, Chief Justice Rehnquist could

 write First English, because we're not talking

 about a damages remedy; we're talking about the 

power of the federal courts to, when their 

jurisdiction is competently invoked and when the

 state has waived its sovereign immunity, require 

the state to comply with its ongoing 

constitutional duty. 

I think that matches both with the 

history, it matches with the tradition, and it 

matches particularly with the Fourteenth 

Amendment context itself.  It's worth 

remembering that when this Court incorporated 

the Fifth Amendment against the states in 

Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, it 

specifically incorporated the right to 

compensation, not the right not to have the 

property taken but the right to receive money,

 These state -- these cases rarely 

appear in federal court, in part because, before 

Knick, no takings case could be filed ab initio, 

but also because, as the magistrate judge's 

opinion in this case points out, it's relatively 

rare for a state to choose to remove this

 federal claim -- this federal right into a 

federal forum.  But, once it does so, once Texas 

has decided it wants the scope of our rights 

under the Fifth Amendment to be litigated in 

federal court, that can't change the scope of 

the claim we make. 

What the Fifth Circuit opinion below 

says is that we cannot state a claim invoking 

our rights under the Fifth Amendment, full stop. 

If Texas is right that, in fact, we have that 

right as a matter of Texas common law, then the 

Fifth Circuit was wrong to say that we only have 

that right under Section 1983.  That counsels in 

favor of reversal. 

But this Court has also squarely held

Amendment does furnish a basis on which a court

cases, that's going to be a state court awarding

 just compensation.  But, when the state wishes

 to be in federal court, I don't think there's a

 good-faith basis for the plaintiff to say, I'm 

invoking my rights under the Fifth Amendment, I 

want the full scope of compensation -- that I'm

 entitled to under the Fifth Amendment, but I

 refuse to allow this claim that arises under my 

rights under the Fifth Amendment to be in

It is the defendant's choice to have 

this federal claim that turns on federal law 

heard in federal court.  That's the choice that 

Texas made, and that choice can't, on the 

merits, extinguish our Fifth Amendment remedy. 

What Texas has effectively 

accomplished here by making the unusual decision 

to remove is that it's eliminated the Fifth 

Amendment question from this case and given 

itself what it believes -- I'm not conceding 

that they're right about Texas law -- but what 

it believes is a more favorable rule of Texas 

law.

Texas has prevented you from making this claim

MR. McNAMARA:  Yes, Your Honor.  There

JUSTICE JACKSON:  If you had sought 

remand and it went back to Texas court, are you 

saying that there wouldn't be the opportunity to

 make this claim in state court?  I'm just trying

 to understand if the claim is totally gone as --

as a general matter here.

 MR. McNAMARA:  I -- so I -- I think --

I -- I see my light is on. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead. 

MR. McNAMARA:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

I -- so I think, Your Honor, first, I don't know 

that we would have had grounds to fight remand 

because the claim does invoke our entitlement 

under federal law.  But, if the case were 

remanded, I think the question in Texas state 

court would be exactly the Question Presented 

here: Are we entitled, without the 1983 

vehicle, to invoke our rights under the Fifth 

Amendment? 

Texas courts have said yes, we are 

entitled to invoke our rights under the Fifth 

Amendment.  But, again, they just cite the Fifth 

Amendment.  They're not invoking some special 

cause of action that they have created.  They,

like other courts, look to the Constitution, to

 this Court's analysis of the Constitution, and 

say the Constitution provides the entitlement to 

just compensation, not, as far as I'm aware, an 

independent common law cause of action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 Let's suppose you bring a -- a -- the 

state takes some action, you claim that is a 

taking, you bring that claim for just 

compensation.  In the state court, they decide 

yes, it was a taking, and so the government owes 

you $3 million.  And the government says:  Wow, 

we didn't think it was worth that much. Here, 

take it back. 

And can they do that? 

MR. McNAMARA:  To -- to a point, Your 

Honor. I think saying here take it back runs 

afoul of what Justice Brennan identified in his 

San Diego Gas & Electric dissent that ending the 

taking just creates an uncompensated temporary 

taking.  And that is why, as this Court noted in 

Knick, Justice Brennan's dissent became the law 

in First English, that just stopping the taking 

creates an uncompensated temporary taking.

Certainly, the -- the state is within 

its rights to cease a taking if it wants to 

cease a taking, and it may be that evidence at 

trial shows Texas has chosen to cease the taking

 here, but the question is and always based on 

the full factual record what property interest 

has Texas actually taken or has the defendant

 actually taken --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can 

claim what we've taken is a temporary, you know, 

right, so we owe you rent, that -- and that's 

just compensation? 

MR. McNAMARA:  Exactly, Your Honor. 

The -- the defendant is always free to say this 

is -- this is just a temporary easement or maybe 

this is a temporary partial easement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can 

say that after the fact? 

MR. McNAMARA:  I -- I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We took the 

whole thing, we found out we were taking more 

than we could -- we're biting off more than we 

could chew, and so we're going to give it back

Your Honor.  Ultimately, the property interest

easement.  The trial court would have to decide 

whether it's a permanent easement, a partial 

easement, a temporary easement, and this is the 

kind of determination courts make in takings 

cases every day.

 MR. McNAMARA:  The -- the remedy --

so, to the extent the Court found on the facts

 easement.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Would that be

 MR. McNAMARA:  Yes, Your Honor, and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  In what way would it

MR. McNAMARA:  So damages are an

damages.  I would have had -- if you had paid me 

on time, I would have had this business

that. So how would you put a value on the 

temporary taking?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. NIELSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. NIELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The Court will be hard-pressed to find 

any government more committed to property than 

Texas. The Texas Constitution is more 

protective than the federal Constitution, and 

Texas courts under a Texas cause of action 

adjudicate takings claims under both 

constitutions.

This appeal thus isn't about

 substantive rights.  All Petitioners had to do

 was use Texas's cause of action.  Instead, 

Petitioners insist they can bring a cause of

 action directly under the federal Takings Clause

 itself.  This argument is wrong for many

 reasons.

 For one, it ignores what the

 Constitution says.  Governments must provide 

just compensation, but the Takings Clause says 

nothing about how they must do it, whether 

through commissions, private bills, or 

litigation. 

For another, this Court held in 

Williams that Congress may constitutionally --

and I'm going to quote here -- "retain for 

itself, the power to hear and determine 

controversies respecting claims against the 

United States."  It follows that, again, a 

quote, "there is no constitutional right to a 

judicial remedy." 

As Petitioners concede, Congress did 

just that for nearly a century.  We don't see 

how this Court could hold for Petitioners 

without overruling Williams.

And as this Court explained in Knick, 

states didn't start recognizing state causes of 

action until after the Fourteenth Amendment's

 ratification.

           Petitioners argue none of this matters 

because of First English, but the Court went out

 of its way in First English to emphasize that 

its decision was about substance, not procedure.

 And if first Williams somehow did 

include a procedural holding, Texas satisfies 

it. We have a cause of action for federal 

takings claims.  Petitioners simply refuse to 

use it. 

We welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  How would that cause 

of action look -- what would it look like? 

MR. NIELSON: So I would point the 

Court to the Texas Supreme Court's decision in 

City of Baytown --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MR. NIELSON: -- and they say, we hear 

claims under both the Texas Constitution and 

under the federal Constitution, and then they

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Let's say we affirm

 here. Can Petitioners' constitutional right be

 vindicated now in -- in Texas courts?

 MR. NIELSON: Well, in federal court. 

The problem is they haven't pleaded the claim. 

So, at this point, you'd have to have leave from 

the district court to amend their complaint if 

they wanted to bring a claim under the Texas

 cause of action. 

There's still live claims here. 

There's still a claim under the Texas 

Constitution itself and they have federal due 

process claims. This is an interlocutory 

appeal. 

So they would have to get leave from 

the district court to amend their complaint to 

bring a claim under Texas common law.  They've 

just never done it because they say they don't 

have to.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can 

require that a federal assertion of rights like

 MR. NIELSON: Well, it's brought under

 court but not federal court?

 MR. NIELSON: When the claim is 

against a state, in Knick, the Court said 19 

times by our count 1983. Every time the Court

 states the holding in Knick, they tie it to 

Section 1983 because there's a difference 

between the substantive right and the cause of

 action. 

In Knick, the cause of action was 

Section 1983 because Congress said, if you're 

going to sue municipalities or cities, there you 

go, there's the cause of action. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you 

removed to federal court, where you couldn't 

bring an action under 1983, right? 

MR. NIELSON: Correct, Your Honor.  We 

did remove to federal -- federal court.  Two 

reasons for that. One, this is not just one 

case. These are four separate cases, all 

putative class actions.  They say there's more 

than a hundred plaintiffs here. 

Texas -- these are filed in different 

counties.  Texas has no way to put all of them 

in a single Texas court.  So, if the cases were

going to be in a single court, it had to be 

through removal and put them in -- in that

 court.

 The second reason for that was Texas

 courts don't have a lot of experience with

 implied rights of action, alleged -- implied

 rights of action under federal law.  This is the

 bread and butter of this Court's -- you guys'

 Court resolves factual -- those types of issues 

all of the time.  So we thought let's just get 

it there, we'll get everybody in one case, and 

we can take out this, you know, putative federal 

cause of action, which we think is flatly 

irreconcilable to begin with. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what --

under what basis would they proceed against the 

state under -- under 1983? 

MR. NIELSON: They -- they couldn't, 

Your Honor.  There is no such claim.  Congress 

has said that you can bring claims against 

cities and municipalities.  You cannot sue the 

states under Section 1983. 

They say they can.  So, under Bell 

v. Hood, they've claimed that there is a federal 

cause of action.  When someone asserts that a

federal cause of action exists, the federal 

courts have jurisdiction to decide whether that 

is true, and then they can decide on the merits

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't

 that a -- a Catch-22 or -- I mean, you say you 

-- they have to proceed in -- in state court.

 They can't proceed in federal court.  And as 

soon as they do, you remove it to federal court 

under 1983, where you say they can't proceed? 

MR. NIELSON: Well, we would make the 

same argument in state or federal court that 

there is no federal cause of action directly 

under the Fifth Amendment.  That is not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but 

that's what was rejected in the -- in the two 

cases that I read to you, Cedar Point and Knick. 

MR. NIELSON: With your respect, Your 

Honor, I don't read either of those cases as 

saying there is a federal cause of action. 

There's certainly a federal substantive right to 

relief, but as this Court said in all of the 

Bivens line of cases or all the implied right of 

action cases, the right to, you know, a -- a 

substantive right does not therefore mean that

But this is a different kind of

It's a right to compensation.  And the state, by 

taking the land and not compensating, is

 MR. NIELSON: Sure, Your Honor.  And I

not a cause of action, that's why I went back to

 Knick.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if it's not a

that a state violates Mr. McNamara's First 

Amendment rights. 

MR. NIELSON: Yep. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could he bring a suit 

about that? 

MR. NIELSON: Yes, Your Honor, for 

injunctive relief. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  And what Mr. 

McNamara, I believe, is saying is that -- that 

the usual distinction that we draw, you can 

bring a right for injunctive relief, but you 

can't -- you can bring a suit for injunctive 

relief, but you can't bring a suit for damages, 

that's the usual distinction.

 MR. NIELSON: Yes, Your Honor.  And so

 I -- I -- I come at this from maybe the other

 direction.  Let's imagine that some government 

said, you know what, we're not going to pay.

 We're telling everybody now.  Now you are on

 notice we are not paying.

 Well, then what happens?  Before they 

could do anything, you would rush to court and 

you would say:  Injunction.  They can't do it. 

They've promised they're not going to pay. 

They're not going to provide that.  And the 

Constitution says, if they don't, they're out of 

-- they're -- they're violating their rights. 

That's Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, where if 

there's -- clear that there's not going to be a 

right to judicial -- to payment, there are no --

no monies coming, not -- not judicial, but no 

payments coming, you can get that injunction 

right away. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, General, let 

me make the point another way.

 give me back my property.  Actually, the state 

has a right to take his property or a

 prerogative to take --

MR. NIELSON: Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- his property.  If 

the state wants to use his property for a 

railroad, it doesn't really matter that the -- a 

person doesn't want to sell. The state has the 

ability to take -- the only thing that the state 

does not have the prerogative to do and the 

thing that the landowner has a right to have is 

payment.

for payment just doesn't understand the nature

But suppose that I'm not such an

 (Laughter.)

 MR. NIELSON: Sure.  All right.  So

 the -- that -- that's the answer I'm going to

 say. So, if we -- if the Court says, we read 

First English and it requires not just a 

substantive relief, it requires some sort of 

judicial proceeding, which we don't think is 

consistent with the history, but let's assume, 

Texas does it. Texas provides the cause of 

action for which they can bring a federal 

takings claim. 

So even if that is true, which we 

don't believe as our first-line argument is 

correct, Texas still wins.  They --

 Texas takes and just this one property owner

 MR. NIELSON: It doesn't work because 

of that. Then the answer is exactly what the

 Constitution says.  Congress -- Section 5 of the 

Fourteenth Amendment says, if a state is

 violating the Constitution, which would be 

happening in this scenario, that's precisely 

what Section 5 is for.

 Congress has never done that --

Would there be some sort of due process 

violation or an argument that the state has to 

provide some sort of forum?

substantive obligation, but there has to be a --

know, vindication of that --

Amendment doesn't create an implied cause of

say, Congress, can you please use your Section 5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And the -- our whole 

system of separated powers is premised on that 

idea. And self-interest here that would be 

created isn't a rogue state but an incentive for 

governments not -- not -- to -- to withdraw 

their -- their existing causes of action. I

 MR. NIELSON:  What we --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And I guess I'm

 wondering --

MR. NIELSON: Sorry.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- why wouldn't the 

injunction order the state to pay?

 MR. NIELSON: So that's a question 

that has not been litigated, whether you could 

have injunctive relief to pay. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Say you have to 

provide --

MR. NIELSON: Correct. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- just 

compensation.  We're not telling you how. 

MR. NIELSON: Yep. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  We're not telling 

you in what forum. 

MR. NIELSON: And -- and -- and --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But -- but the 

Constitution commands it. 

MR. NIELSON: Sure.  As I said, that's 

-- if you want to read First English that way, 

Texas has no quarrel with that because we 

provide it.  And we don't just provide through a

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But you have to

 MR. NIELSON: Yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I think Justice

 Gorsuch's premise is that Texas isn't doing

MR. NIELSON: Okay.  So, if we say 

that a Texas doesn't or -- or some state doesn't 

have a -- a court proceeding and you don't have

can get an injunction, and if you know the state 

doesn't have any of those things, you can get 

that injunction very, very, very early.

How would they go to the Texas court

MR. NIELSON: So -- yes.  So what they 

would say here, and, candidly, the pleadings 

have never been as pellucid as I think anyone 

would have liked, but what I think that they --

they would say is, we are bringing our claim 

under state law, see City -- see, e.g., City of 

Baytown.  I think that would be sufficient to 

get us there.

federal court to basically have a class action 

and you couldn't do it in state court, so -- but 

you had to fight something, which -- I don't

So, if we misunderstood what they were

 saying --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if -- if they 

go back down and say to the district court, this 

has been remanded to the district court, all we 

want is just compensation under the Texas 

Constitution and the Fifth Amendment under that 

case that you're mentioning, that's okay and 

you're not going to resist that? 

MR. NIELSON: We -- we -- we would not 

resist that, Your Honor.

Gorsuch's injunction-to-pay hypothetical, I just 

want to make sure I'm clear on that. 

MR. NIELSON: Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I thought you were 

saying we don't need to answer that question in 

this case because Texas provides forums for 

compensation.

Constitution make that clear, including the text 

of the just compensation clause itself. It says 

property shall not be taken, no person --

property shall not be taken for public use

 without just compensation. 

The right is not to have the property

 taken without compensation.  It's not a right to

 compensation.  And this -- it's prohibitory.  It

 has a condition for the -- governmental action 

to be lawful.  That condition is the payment of 

compensation.  If there's not compensation, then 

the action is unlawful, and what lies is an 

injunction to cease the taking of the property. 

This Court in -- in a number of 

recent -- relatively recent cases has made that 

point. In Ruckelshaus versus Monsanto, in Dames 

& Moore, in the railroad reorganization cases, 

the question really was, should there be an 

injunction preventing this statute from going 

into effect, or is there compensation available 

under the Tucker Act such that an injunction 

would not be appropriate? 

In all of those cases, that's what the 

Court held, that there was compensation 

available.  But that -- the the very question

presupposed that there might be situations in

 which compensation was not available.  That's

 the violation.

 And the -- the same thing, if you look 

at the overall context of the Fifth Amendment,

 that is also true.  It -- the preceding clause,

 as Justice Alito pointed out, says that no 

person shall be deprived of property without due

 process.  The prohibition is the -- deprivation, 

the condition -- without -- without the 

condition of due process. 

If a court finds a violation, it 

doesn't order due process.  It orders -- it 

enjoins the conduct that was undertaken without 

due process.  The government can always go back 

and do it over again with due process. 

And -- and, finally, there's another 

clause in the Fifth Amendment that is written in 

exactly the same way, the indictment clause.  It 

says a person shall not be held for a capital or 

otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment 

of an indictment.  An indictment is the 

condition precedent to having a lawful holding 

of somebody for a crime, and one --

 you -- you filed in First English 38 years ago, 

you argued that the Constitution does not of its 

own force furnish a basis for a court to award

 money damages against the government.

 Now, in the decision in First English, 

Justice Rehnquist rejected the idea that "the 

Constitution does not, of its own force, furnish 

a basis for the court to award money damages 

against the government." 

Now it seems to me that the question 

is -- turns on basis. And what you seem to be 

saying is it created a general theory of what 

the government had to do. But that doesn't mean 

that anybody could take that and recover 

compensation.  They have to go get an injunction 

or they -- they can't proceed at all because 

there's no cause of action?

all. But our point -- our point, that portion 

of our brief was really going to the cause of

 action question and -- and for the reasons that

 we said in that brief and this brief, and -- and

 I don't think the Court rejected this.

 For all the reasons we said, not just 

the text of the clause, but -- but the

 Appropriations Clause, the Fifth Amendment only

 applied to the United States, the Appropriations 

Clause would have prohibited any court from 

awarding a money judgment or an injunction to 

pay money because only Congress can authorize 

the payment of money from the Treasury. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 

MR. KNEEDLER:  OPM versus Richmond 

makes that clear. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 

Constitution can do it too, which is what the 

rest of that footnote rejecting the arguments 

that the government made in First English said. 

It says that the "cases made clear that it is 

the Constitution that dictates the remedy for

So I -- I'm not sure how you get

 around the fact that the Constitution speaks in

 terms of just compensation and not an

 injunction.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, as I said, it

 speaks in terms of compensation in terms of 

defining the right, which is not to have 

property taken without just -- just 

compensation. But that footnote, I think it's 

important to understand the context of that 

footnote. 

In fact, all of First English was 

about the Agins rule in the -- in the -- in 

California, which said there was not even a 

taking.  Sometimes they said you -- no 

compensation, but there was no taking until a 

court first determined that there was a taking. 

And that was the rule, that was the 

controversy at the time, the so-called temporary 

taking.  Does -- does the taking arise in a 

regulatory context at the time the regulation is 

effective or later?  That was the issue that the 

Court rejected, and in that respect, it said no, 

compensation is owed from the moment of -- of 

the Constitution.  And what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Kneedler, I have a 

little trouble understanding your argument about

 the Tucker Act.  In your view, neither the 

Tucker Act nor the Takings Clause provides a

 cause of action, but then you say the 

combination of the two somehow provides a cause

 of action. 

And the Petitioner says that what 

you're saying is that nothing plus nothing 

equals something.  So this -- you must be 

relying on some kind of higher math that I can't 

understand.  Where -- what is the cause of 

action --

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I -- I --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in a Tucker Act 

suit? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- as I said, I think 

it's the combination of the two. It's not zero 

plus zero; it's one-half plus one-half.  The --

the -- as we say, the -- the -- the 

Constitution, the Fifth Amendment itself, does 

not create a -- a -- a cause of action. It

 extraordinary.  We went for 200 years, as 

pointed out, with that not being the case.

 But what the Tucker Act does is, as 

the Court said two terms ago, three terms ago, I

 guess, it provides the framework under which

 it's -- it can be determined whether Congress 

has provided the ability to -- to sue under the

 Tucker Act.

           The Tucker Act standard is whether the 

particular substantive provision that is being 

relied upon creates a -- can reasonably be read 

to mandate compensation if there is a violation. 

By definition -- and the Court made this point 

in Bormes -- the Tucker Act is there for 

something where there is an obligation but no 

elements of a cause of action.  So the -- the --

for example, the Fifth Amendment or the statute 

that may be involved, particular statute that 

may be involved, by definition does not create a 

cause of action. 

Congress provided in the Tucker Act 

that you can recover compensation if -- if the 

other provision of law can reasonably be 

construed.  That's a -- that's a Tucker Act 

standard for when --

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Suppose

 there -- suppose that the Takings Clause was not 

in the Constitution, but Congress enacted a

 statute that said the federal government shall 

not take private property for public use without

 just compensation. 

Would that be a money-mandating 

statute that creates a cause of action?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think so.  I --

because it's a -- it's a -- it's a prohibition, 

I think it's the same -- the same as the Fifth 

Amendment itself.  It -- it is a directive to 

Congress not to -- or executive not to take 

property without affording compensation. 

Now it may be that the particular 

statute would be understood or could be 

interpreted that way, but, here, we're talking 

about the Constitution, and no other provision 

of the Constitution provides of its own force a 

remedy, particularly a remedy for damages. 

And that would have been extraordinary 

at the time the Constitution was adopted because 

of the Appropriations Clause, sovereign 

immunity, and the Debt Clause.  If -- if 

compensation is not paid, that is a debt of the

we interpreted the statute in Maine Community

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And so, to the

compensation as a remedial matter. 

If you have a cause of action, how do 

you calculate the remedy?  All of the cases, it 

says, as the cases in the text make clear, it --

it -- it -- it's a remedy, and it does provide a 

basis for compensation, but in a cause of action 

where there already is one.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Two questions. 

First, the rogue state example, why shouldn't we

 worry about that?  It -- why shouldn't we worry

 about the incentive structure we create that

 would allow states to withdraw compensation 

schemes, and maybe the federal government too,

 to exploit this loophole?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  With respect, it's not 

a loophole.  It's a -- it's a fundamental aspect 

of the Constitution that the Constitution does 

not -- does not require this. 

And the rogue state is answered by 

it's a prohibition, and if -- if Congress does 

not provide the condition necessary to render it 

lawful, you have an injunction -- injunctive 

action.  And as the Court said in Knick, that 

was the way --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- that just 

compensation issues were raised before. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And then, 

second, this may be a question better directed

feature of the procedural history of this case.

 The complaint has two counts about takings.  One 

is under the state constitution, and the other 

is under the federal Constitution.

 How do we read what the Fifth Circuit 

did here? Did it only dismiss the second, the 

federal claim, and is the first claim under, 

what is it, City of Bayview and the -- and the

 Texas Constitution, still live?  Do they even 

need to amend their complaint to add it?  Is it 

already there? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  There's a footnote in 

the court of appeals' opinion that says that the 

Texas Constitution or Texas provides a cause of 

action.  And that is not further elaborated 

upon, but it -- it's --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No.  Exactly. 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- it's remanded for 

further proceedings, so --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So do you take it 

that that first count under the state

plaintiffs?

 Kavanaugh?

 Justice Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Kneedler, just

 want to clarify something.  So your position in 

response to, say, the rogue state hypothetical, 

when you said an injunction is the solution, 

it's not an injunction to pay money because you 

said the United States thinks that can't happen. 

So is it your position that if, say, a 

state or the United States takes property, 

refuses to get -- give just compensation for it, 

that the property owner could get an injunction 

essentially saying, give me my property back if 

you're not going to pay, and perhaps get that 

injunction but not get reimbursed for the 

temporary taking that happened in between the 

seizure and the award of the injunction? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  That -- that is -- that 

is correct.  And it -- the same thing would be 

true, you -- there could be a temporary 

deprivation of due process, and if you get an 

injunction preventing the government from doing

whatever it did without due process, there is an

 in -- interim period, but a person could go to 

court, get a TRO, get a preliminary injunction

 to -- to prevent that from going on a long -- a 

long time. That's just the nature of litigation 

and an injunction, but it doesn't lead to the

 question of damages.

 And this Court's cases, First English 

and others, had to do with the calculation 

whether interest should be paid, and that's what 

the Court meant about the Fifth Amendment being 

a basis for the award of compensation, not that 

there was a cause of action. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Jackson? 

JUSTICE JACKSON: And just to clarify 

from what Justice Barrett just said, the 

government's position would be that you might be 

able to have a cause of action, say, under state 

law or whatnot for that temporary taking.  It's 

not that you would be out the compensation 

entirely, right? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  It -- that --

that would depend on -- on state law and the 

availability of a state cause of action on that.

But we're -- I'm only talking about the federal

 causes of action, which that -- there's no basis

 for an award of money out of the Treasury and

 overcoming sovereign immunity and all that in 

federal court for a compensation even for that

 interim period.

 But the interim period is endemic

 to -- to litigation, due process violation being

 held on -- on an indictment, but that is the 

proper remedy and that's the -- the remedy that 

existed until the Tucker Act was passed.  It was 

the remedy that this Court said in Knick was the 

way to vindicate Fifth Amendment rights -- until 

the Tucker Act or state constitutions came along 

and provided a monetary remedy.

from Texas to say that the City of Baytown

 decision means that Texas courts hear claims 

"under the federal Constitution."

 The complaint pleads a claim under the

 federal Constitution, and to the extent Texas's 

only complaint with that was that it failed to

 cite directly to a Texas Supreme Court decision, 

it's not clear why Texas moved to dismiss it,

 sought an interlocutory appeal of that decision 

as a dispositive issue and then extinguished it 

on the merits in the Fifth Circuit. 

To the extent that claim exists, that 

claim has been extinguished and that warrants 

reversal. 

To the original meaning, and I think, 

Your Honor, the -- the rogue state example is 

not a hypothetical.  It's a real example because 

state after state has looked to federal law and 

to First English as the thing that prevents the 

state from denying compensation. 

That's true in Oregon, as I mentioned, 

but also New Mexico, South Carolina, Nebraska, 

the list goes on of states that provide

 compensation.

 And they're correct to understand

 that, Your Honor.  The original understanding, 

as evidenced by writings from James Madison to

 St. George Tucker, is that the Fifth Amendment

 creates an obligation to pay, which is why you 

can sue under the Tucker Act because the Fifth 

Amendment creates an obligation to pay. 

Only in the absence of a court of 

competent jurisdiction to enforce that 

obligation does -- do the federal courts resort 

to cases like Meigs v. McClung's Lessee, where 

the Court ejected the United States military 

from its own base because it didn't have clean 

title. That -- that is the last resort in the 

absence of a court that has the jurisdiction to 

enforce that obligation. 

That's why, in Maine Community Health, 

this Court specifically pointed to the Takings 

Clause as the analogy for what sort of 

money-mandating inquiry it means to create the 

obligation to pay. 

But, more broadly, Your Honor, I -- I 

think Texas's understanding of the Fifth 

Amendment would relegate property rights to the

status of the poor relation of the Bill of

 Rights. 

It would be the only acknowledged

 ongoing obligation in the Constitution that is 

entitled to no enforcement, that is left

 entirely to the discretion of the government

 entities that are supposedly obligated to pay.

 But, surely, as evidenced by the writings and by 

the adoption of the Fifth Amendment itself, the 

Framers meant for property rights to mean more 

than that. 

If the Court has no further questions, 

we'll rest on our briefs. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:23 p.m., the case
