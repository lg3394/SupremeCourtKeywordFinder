 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will --

we'll hear argument this morning in Case 22-800,

 Moore versus United States.

 Counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW M. GROSSMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GROSSMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The word "income" is not an inkblot. 

"Income" was understood at the time of the 

Sixteenth Amendment's adoption to refer to gains 

coming into the taxpayer, like wages, rents, and 

dividends.  Appreciation in the value of a home, 

a stock investment, or other property is not and 

never has been taxed as income.  The reason is 

that a gain is not income unless and until it 

has been realized by the taxpayer. 

The Court squarely held as much in 

Eisner versus Macomber just a few years 

following adoption of the amendment, and the 

Court's decisions have held that line for a 

century. 

That precedent makes easy work of this

case. It is undisputed that the Petitioners 

realized nothing from their stock investment.

 They were taxed not because they had any income

 but because, in 2017, they happened to own

 shares in a corporation carrying retained

 earnings on its books.

 This is a tax on the ownership of

 property.  It therefore must be apportioned.

 Dispensing with the need for 

realization sweeps away what the Framers 

regarded as the essential check on Congress's 

power to tax property.  The government cannot 

identify a single thing that Congress couldn't 

tax as income under its position that 

realization is unnecessary.  Without 

realization, there is no limiting principle. 

Accepting the government's position on 

income would make a hash of the current law. 

The Tax Code's gateway definition of "gross 

income" exerts the full measure of Congress's 

taxing power under the Sixteenth Amendment by 

reaching all income from whatever source 

derived. 

If the government's position in this 

case is right, then current law already requires

taxpayers to report and pay tax on appreciation 

in the value of all their assets, on corporate

 earnings for any stocks that they own, and on 

any paper gains from their contracts and loans.

 That's not how the income tax has ever

 worked going back to 1913.  Again, the reason

 the law doesn't work that way is the obvious

 one. Unrealized gains are not income.  The only 

way to make sense of the income tax as it's 

existed for a century is to stick with the 

original meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. 

The Court should reaffirm that there 

is no income without realization. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  When you say 

"realization," what -- do you have a definition 

for that or an explanation as to exactly what it 

is, and -- and how is it different from, say, 

attribution? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you, Justice 

Thomas.  Realization in the main is going to be 

receipt, but in other instances, it would be 

other types of enjoyment of an economic gain 

such that the taxpayer can put that gain to his 

or her own uses and benefits.  That might be

of income to a third party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there

 certainly is realization here by the

 corporation, if not the taxpayers, right?  It 

isn't a case like appreciation of property where

 nothing has happened.  You know, you buy 

property, you're holding it for 20 years, you 

haven't sold it, nothing has happened. Here, 

something has happened, and income has gone to 

the corporation, isn't that right? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Yes. The corporation 

has income, and we -- we don't dispute that the 

corporation realized income over the decade-plus 

years that are being taxed by the MRT. But I --

I think it really is like the instance of simply 

appreciation of property from the point of view 

of the shareholders. 

The shareholders' interest in the 

corporation is solely a capital interest, a 

property interest, and so the value of their 

capital has increased.  It has appreciated. 

But, as shareholders, no, they have not realized 

any income.

-- why do we permit taxing of individual 

partners when either state law or their

 partnership agreement doesn't realize the income

 to them?  In many states, a partner doesn't have 

personal ownership, doesn't get the value of the 

partnership, yet we've permitted that tax.

 MR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you, Justice

 Sotomayor.  A partnership is a fundamentally 

different form of organization than a 

corporation.  The law has always recognized that 

a corporation is a person separate from the 

shareholders in that corporation.  And there 

simply isn't that separate personhood that 

applies to partnerships.  The partnerships are 

simply a group of people who come together to 

undertake a business activity, and when they do 

so, the income that comes in to them is their 

income directly.  That's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you do 

with Subpart F or Subpart S or all of the other 

ways in which we have attributed corporate 

income to individuals?

between themselves and income that is 

otherwise theirs.  It would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that's 

the whole purpose of a corporate structure. 

People do that all the time, particularly for 

that purpose.  You don't incorporate unless you 

want the corporate shield.  You don't 

incorporate unless you want the benefits of the 

corporate protection. 

So, under your theory, Subpart F, 

Subpart S -- these are longstanding taxing 

mechanisms by the government -- your theory 

would undermine those as well, wouldn't it? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I don't think that's 

right. Subpart F, again, works on simply 

categories of income on a current basis where

Subpart F. You know, Sub -- the Court has never 

considered the constitutionality of Subpart F, 

but, as we take it, we don't think that there's 

a constitutional issue there. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So what is the 

distinction?  Is it just that other parts of 

Subpart F, to the extent that they tax income, 

do it on an annual basis and the MRT was a one 

shot that went backwards?

 fundamental income-shifting concept, whereas the 

MRT doesn't, and that's so in two respects.

 First of all, Subpart F operates on a

 current basis while the corporation is subject 

to the control of the controlling shareholders,

 whereas the MRT takes no account of whether --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm sorry. 

There's no question that you meet the definition 

of Subpart F. You need in Subpart F at least 10 

percent of the company's share, and the company 

has to be owned more than 50 percent by U.S. 

owners. So it's identical in terms of the 

percentage of ownership or the percentage of 

shares. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  That's right, but 

Subpart F, unlike the MRT, aligns the control 

and the ability to redirect income with the year 

that it is applicable to.  The MRT takes account 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sounds to me that

 right for the reason that -- I -- I think 

whether you owned a particular piece of property 

on a given date, which is the question that the 

MRT asks, is sort of the sine qua non of a tax 

on property, whereas Subpart F looks at income 

as it comes in while the controlling shareholder

 has the ability to redirect that stream of

 income.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But isn't that then 

just a question of whether it's fair to 

attribute -- fair from a due process point of 

view, as Justice Sotomayor was saying, whether 

it's fair to attribute the income generated by 

KisanKraft to the Moores, which is a distinct 

question of whether there was income within the 

meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, right? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think it 

ultimately comes down to a Sixteenth Amendment 

question for the same reason that the Court 

thought so in Macomber, which is that a 

shareholder's interest in a corporation, 

including in its income, is a capital interest 

and therefore a property interest.

question of income and why it is that the

 shareholder isn't being taxed on what would

 otherwise be a property interest.

 So I think the Court has always 

addressed this sort of question as a question of

 income as a -- and that includes, for example, 

all of the assignment-of-income cases that the

 Court has decided over the years. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go back to 

square -- to first principles? 

The concept of realization was very 

well established at the time that the Sixteenth 

Amendment was adopted, but the Amendment does 

not reference realization.  All that the 

drafters had to do was add the word "realize" 

after "income" to lay and collect taxes on 

income realized, but they never used the word 

"realize." 

And then I look at the history both 

before and after the ratification, as far back 

as 1864, not so far back, Congress taxed -- from 

the ratification -- Congress taxed "gains and 

profits of all companies, whether incorporated 

or partnerships, in" -- "in estimating the

 In 1913, just eight months after the

 ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, 

Congress included undistributed corporate 

earnings to certain shareholders. 

Your brief tries to distinguish all

 these things, but I come back to the main point. 

Both sides can point to congressional actions 

that taxed some realized income, some -- or 

didn't unrealize -- didn't tax unrealized 

income, but we have examples of Congress taxing 

realized -- unrealized income. 

Why don't I take it that the plain 

text of the amendment doesn't make reference to 

realization? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I think there are two 

central features of the text of the amendment 

that reflect that it does apply only to realized 

gains. 

The first is simply the use of the 

word "income."  I would particularly commend to 

the Court's attention the amicus brief follow --

understanding at the time. 

One of the economists recognized that 

he was simply espousing his own economic views 

divorced from any question of law or common 

understanding, and the second economist 

recognized that the common understanding of 

"income" is what we say that it was, a realized

and Linguistics, which looks at how the word was 

used in everyday language at that time, and it

 concludes that unanimously, where it's possible 

to distinguish, "income" meant realized gains.

 There's also in the amendment the 

language "from whatever source derived." As we 

pointed out, "derived" was generally meant to 

refer to concepts like receipts. And, indeed, 

again, the amicus brief of the Professors of Law

drew, we don't approve of that distinction.

 MR. GROSSMAN:  Right.  I think that

 what the Sixteenth Amendment did was remove the

 necessity to consider whether income came from 

one source, particularly property, versus other

 types of sources.  But, in so doing, it 

necessarily required as a precedent that the

 amounts -- that what was being taxed, in fact,

 be income and not something else. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why should we 

take the common meaning of "income" rather than 

the legal meaning given the context that Justice 

Kagan points out? 

I mean, if the Sixteenth Amendment was 

specifically responding to this -- this Court's 

legal precedent related to the meaning of 

"income," I guess I'm curious as to why you 

think that the common meaning of "income" is 

what we should be focused on when we try to 

understand what the Sixteenth Amendment meant 

when it used that term.

addressing questions of original meaning, but

 Amendment is to be construed according to its

 that personal property was not subject to

we would consider each tax on its own form.

 You're asking us to just announce what

 realization is out of context.  And for the last 

hundred years, we've been studiously avoiding

 doing that because we recognize that it's

 dangerous to do that.  To -- to state a -- a

 word like "realization," we then have to come up 

with a working definition that applies to every 

piece of property and every way in which people 

gain wealth.  It doesn't seem logical to me. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Respect --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why don't you just 

concentrate on why Congress can't say that in 

certain situations it's going to ignore the 

corporate form and attribute to the individual 

shareholders certain income?  That's what it's 

been doing all along.  And, here, it doesn't 

need realization because Congress has attributed 

this to the individual owners of the 

corporation. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Respectfully, the Court 

has already said in multiple occasions that 

realization is, in fact, required for there to 

be income under the Sixteenth Amendment.  It's

right?

 Congress -- the -- the U.S. Government

 can't tax those foreign corporations directly,

 and they wanted to make sure that Americans 

didn't kind of stash their money in the foreign

 corporations, watch their money grow, and never

 pay taxes on them.

 So, you -- you know, there's a long

 century-old history of these kinds of taxes on 

gains from your holdings in a foreign 

corporation.  Why is this any different and why 

shouldn't we understand that to be quite well 

settled, that Congress can implement those taxes 

and enforce those taxes for those purposes?

JUSTICE KAGAN:  These are the same

 shareholders as in Subpart F.

 MR. GROSSMAN:  The difference is that

 those provisions have typically addressed things 

like passive income and related party 

transactions that are properly attributable to,

 say, a parent corporation.

 In other words, a parent corporation

 could own an income-generating asset itself, or 

it could simply shift that into a corporation, 

into a foreign corporation, and thereby avoid 

the income. 

And what the law has recognized is 

that just as in cases like Horst and Banks, 

that's effectively an assignment of income and 

that -- and that it can be attributed to the --

to the person who -- the parent corporation for 

that reason because the parent corporation is 

the one that controls the flow of the income as 

it's coming in. 

The MRT, by contrast, operates as a 

tax on property.  It doesn't take account of any 

power that the shareholder had over the income 

as it was coming in the door to the corporation. 

It only takes account of the ownership in 2017.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That seems to be

 an argument about timing.  In other words, we 

have realization in this case. The entity

 realized income.  The question then is 

attribution, and we've long held that Congress 

may attribute the income of the company to the

 shareholders or the partnership to the partners, 

and the only real wrinkle, I think, here is that 

it goes back and captures prior years' income. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I think there are two 

-- two wrinkles. One is that, with respect to 

those prior years, the statute doesn't require 

that the shareholders being taxed had any 

ability to control the disposition of the income 

in those years. That's a fundamental 

distinction. 

The second is that Subpart F --

for the facts of this case, though, correct?

 But, second, the provisions --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If it had been

 taxed year by year, would that have been

 MR. GROSSMAN:  No, and that's the 

second wrinkle, so to speak. 

In this -- the -- the MRT is sort --

is the inverse of what -- of its press -- of its 

predecessors in the statutes.  All the 

predecessors, like the foreign personal holding 

company provisions, as well as Subpart F, focus 

on categories of income.  They're susceptible to 

being reassigned into the corporate form. 

Congress has never reached so far as 

to tax shareholders of foreign corporations on 

the active business income of those 

corporations, but --

why is that different analytically?  I mean,

 system, and this is one piece of that, but I

 guess I'm not sure why the -- which kind of 

income is at issue matters for the ultimate 

analysis of whether the attribution is

 permissible.

 MR. GROSSMAN:  Because all of these 

attribution schemes going back to the very

 beginning have focused on effectively the

 fraudulent or improper availment of the 

corporate form to avoid income, and they've 

always done that historically by focusing on 

particular categories of income that are 

susceptible to that type of abuse. 

Congress took that to the max as it 

amended Subpart F over the years to capture more 

and more types of that sort of income avoidance. 

What's interesting is that Subpart F 

says you've captured the field, now let's get 

everything else, and the -- the "everything 

else" is the active business income that's 

attributable solely to the foreign corporation's 

own legitimate business activities overseas. 

And so a -- the shareholder in a foreign

 This isn't the type of income that 

that shareholder would, in the ordinary course 

of affairs or as a matter of reality, be able to

 shift around into a corporate form and thereby

 avoid receiving it themselves.

 I also want to address just the

 difficulties that the government's 

interpretation would raise with respect to the 

current Tax Code. 

As I noted, the Tax Code already --

already reaches the full extent of Congress's 

authority under the Sixteenth Amendment.  And if 

the government is right, therefore, that certain 

novel categories of income -- of -- of --

certain novel categories of what had heretofore 

been regarded as unrealized income or unrealized 

depreciation were -- were subject to taxation 

under the Sixteenth Amendment, then those would 

already be subject to taxation under existing 

law.

 Sixteenth Amendment's use of income requires 

realization and that the MRT does not meet the

 realization requirement -- those are two, I 

think, different steps of your analysis -- it 

seems to me that all we've done is demonstrate 

that the Sixteenth Amendment doesn't justify the

 MRT.

 Don't you still have to demonstrate

 that the MRT is a direct tax in order to 

establish that the Constitution has been 

violated? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, if the MRT is not 

a tax on income, then I think it stands to 

reason that it would be a tax on the ownership 

of shares, because, otherwise, there's --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, the government 

makes another argument in their -- in their 

brief. For example, they offer that it could be 

an excise tax.  So I guess my point is just any 

indirect tax I would think just has to be 

uniform under the Constitution.  So it seems 

it's -- as though it's your burden, regardless 

of this issue about realization, to -- to 

establish that this tax is a direct tax in order 

to sustain your constitutional argument.

Am I wrong about that?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  We alleged below that

 it was a direct tax.  The government filed a

 motion to dismiss.  It argued that it was, in 

fact, a tax on income. It did not dispute --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I appreciate that

 people haven't argued this.  But would we then 

send it back to the Ninth Circuit to determine 

this issue of whether or not it's a direct tax? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I think --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Or is it your 

argument that we can -- we can sustain its 

constitutionality just because we haven't had 

briefing on this particular aspect of it? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I -- I think what 

the Court could do is answer the question 

presented.  As to whether or not there would be 

anything left for remand, I think it's at the 

Court's discretion as to whether it wishes to 

reach the government's excise tax argument. 

So far as that argument is concerned, 

again, the bare text of the statute operates 

based solely on ownership of a particular piece 

of property on a particular date and takes no 

account of any type of business operations of

 That is the sort of tax that Flint,

 which I think is the high water mat -- mark of

 argument.

less expensive to manufacture or acquire, then

concerned personal property in the form of 

investments.  I think it's well established at 

this time that taxes on personal property --

distinction between real and personal property

 those who invest in those -- in those companies, 

whereas, in real estate, unless there is a 

transaction, a sale or a lease or something, 

there's no taxable transaction.

 So would there be a difference between 

a stake in a corporation or partnership, as

 opposed to real estate or personal -- other

 personal property? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I don't think so.  I 

mean, the Court has applied the same principles 

across the sweep of its Sixteenth Amendment 

cases. Pretty much all of the early ones 

applying the principle that we put forward did 

involve corporate investments and different 

types of corporate reorganizations that the 

government argued resulted in income to the 

shareholders. 

But the Court applied the same 

principles in cases like Horst, for -- I'm 

sorry -- Bruun, for example, that involved real 

property and recognized that in that instance 

there equally had to be realization.  Likewise, 

in Blatts, the Court reached the opposite 

results in Bruun with -- again, with respect to 

an improvement made to real property.

So we don't think the constitutional

 principles are any different.  I think the only 

difference perhaps with respect to corporate 

shares is that the government might have an 

argument that there is some type of constructive

 realization under the -- under the statute that

 imposes the tax.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But isn't that a --

as a -- just based on the questions this 

morning, that seemed to be a vulnerability that 

you would not have with real property, for 

instance. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I don't think it's a 

vulnerability given that the -- given the 

general principle that's required and given the 

nature of this tax.  I think it would be a more 

difficult case if this tax were structured in an 

entirely different fashion that didn't operate 

in the way that it does, but that's obviously a

your definition, I think, would affect the

 partners, no?  Those individual shareholders.

 MR. GROSSMAN:  No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  We -- we don't think

 that those provisions present any constitutional

 difficulty whatsoever.  Again, a corporation is 

different.  The Court's cases have recognized 

that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- I -- I

liability or -- or closely held, it's still a 

corporation. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, first of all, I 

mean, you've got -- distinguishing a corporation 

from partnership, I mean, again, you have the 

doctrine of corporate personhood that the Court 

has long understood does make a difference in 

these circumstances. 

But so far as other types of 

corporations like S corporations are concerned,

 If somebody wants to come to the

that's how I've organized my business and am

 operating it, I think the government can accept

 that as a concession.

it's a question of a concession by the

attribute the income?

certainly has done nothing to get in the way of 

that you have to distinguish here, and I just 

want to make sure I understand your distinctions 

and whether there's a single distinction that 

sort of covers all of these or whether each one

 has a different explanation.

 So here are my four.  It's Subpart F, 

it's S Corporations, it's partnerships, and it's 

taxing on an accrual basis.  So give me why it 

is that you think we can decide for you without 

putting any of those kinds of very established 

taxation schemes at risk.

MR. GROSSMAN:  Again, Subpart F uses

 that familiar -- that familiar mechanism of

 simply attributing income to the person who 

earned it even if they've directed it somewhere

 else, and it's long -- and taxes of that nature

 have long been justified on that basis.

 S corporations, again, are by election

 of the shareholders.  If they concede that this 

is, in fact, their income and that's how they're 

operating their business, I don't think that the 

government would have any basis not to take them 

at their word should the government choose to do 

so. 

So far as partnerships are concerned, 

again, there's no separate person that sits 

above the shareholders of -- of -- of a -- or, 

I'm sorry, the partners of a partnership.  And 

those have always been treated differently going 

back to -- I mean, gosh, going back to the 

Dartmouth College case, and -- and -- where it 

wasn't even new at that point. 

But, with respect to income, going 

back to Gibbons versus Mahon, which recognized 

it as a well-established principle at that point 

that corporations are different in that respect

from partnerships, indeed, that was the basis on

 which Macomber rejected the same -- the same

 argument.

 And then, finally, with respect to 

accrual, the Court already addressed that issue

 in the Safety Car Heating & Lighting case, where 

it held that standard Sixteenth Amendment

 realization principles -- and -- and it cited,

 among others, Macomber -- apply to the accrual 

method of accounting. 

So, you know, whatever question there 

might be about that methodology and -- and its 

constitutional status, I think, at this point, 

that's been long established and is water under 

the bridge. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mm-hmm. And can I go 

back to Justice Thomas's question, which is your 

own definition of "realization"? And I'm just 

going to give you Macomber's, and tell me if you 

agree with it or disagree with it or think it 

needs to be modified. 

Macomber said, That which precedes 

from the property is severed from the capital, 

is received or drawn by the recipient, that is, 

the taxpayer, for his separate use.

Is that your definition too?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  I think subsequent case 

law has recognized that the separation concept

 maybe doesn't necessarily apply in every

 circumstance, although it does apply in the

 circumstance of distinguishing shareholders

 versus corporations. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So, for 

example, in Bruun, we've basically ignored the 

separation requirement, correct? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  The Court said that it 

was applicable in the corporate context but not 

necessarily in other contexts, in that example, 

for example, an improvement that was made to 

land that was not severable from the land. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that -- that 

definition really wouldn't be very good to -- to 

explain Subpart F, is that correct too? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think what the 

Court has recognized in subsequent cases is that 

it's really the concept of realization as 

opposed to, say, actual receipt that is 

important. 

I mean, look, it's going to --

is basically we've left Macomber behind?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  No. I think the

 Court's cases through Glenshaw Glass, you know, 

up through as recently as, say, Indianapolis

 Power & Light or Banks recognize that there is

 something more that is need -- that is needed 

than a mere economic gain.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no. I wasn't

 suggesting that we've left entirely behind any 

concept of realization.  I mean, that's a 

different question, but that we've left the 

Macomber definition of "realization" behind. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I don't think -- I -- I 

think that Macomber's holding in that respect 

remains good law.  I don't think that it's been 

left behind. 

Macomber goes on to recognize, for 

example, regarding corporations that there may 

be appropriate circumstances for the law to look 

behind the corporate form to ascertain the true 

right and actions of the shareholder with 

respect to income. 

And so I think take -- Macomber taken 

as a whole does recognize this principle and it 

used the best language that occurred to the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I think the argument

 we -- we've kind of heard from the other side 

involves, okay, if there is a realization 

requirement, it's met here because the 

corporation realized the income, and then it 

just becomes a question of attribution of that 

realized income, and Congress has a free hand 

there, and the Sixteenth Amendment says nothing. 

Your response. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  My response is that 

income is -- I mean, the Court has always looked 

at questions of income from the point of view of 

the shareholder.  If you point to a Sixteenth 

Amendment case or a case involving gross income 

under -- under the Tax Code, the Court has 

always looked at the individual circumstances of 

the shareholder to ascertain whether or not 

that -- that shareholder has actually realized a

gain.

 And so, for example, Indianapolis

 Power & Light, a 1990 case, the Court looked

 specifically at the facts regarding certain

 types of customer security deposits.  It didn't 

look at it as some sort of abstract inquiry

 where things might be assigned and so forth. It 

sought to address the question as to whether or 

not that's shareholder income. 

Macomber did exactly the same thing 

with respect to shareholders of corporations.  I 

think the Court would certainly have to reverse 

Macomber, which the government has not asked it 

to do, to get beyond the idea that, you know, to 

some free-floating notion of income is 

sufficient for the government to point at 

something and tax it to a particular individual 

as their income. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It -- it -- you're 

saying, if I -- if I can put a fine point on it 

if I understand it, the question is whether it's 

income to the taxpayer who's being taxed? 

MR. GROSSMAN: Yes, Your Honor.

with Justice Jackson, and I understand your

 point that the excise argument has been

 forfeited or perhaps even waived in this case.

 I just want your thoughts on it

 generally as an original matter. You know, we 

have the Hylton case from quite a long time ago, 

carriages were thought perhaps not to be a

 direct tax.

 Could the government as an original 

matter call this an excise tax? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I think the answer 

resoundingly would be no. The whole point of 

the direct tax clauses was to make it difficult 

for Congress to levy these types of taxes while 

still leaving that authority available at -- you 

know, in times of emergency. 

And so far as taxes on personal 

property and things like investments were 

concerned, that was addressed extensively during 

the ratification debates of the -- for the 

Constitution, and it was really -- it was really 

one of the primary arguments of the 

anti-federalists against ratification of the 

Constitution, was that permitting the 

government -- permitting Congress to levy direct

taxes would simply be a step too far and would 

-- and would allow Congress to destroy --

destroy the states and reach all the property 

that was known to all families across the

 country.

 So, I mean, that was one of the

 foremost concerns, and the way the -- the way 

that the Framers addressed that was to render 

these types of taxes specifically subject to 

apportionment.  I mean, this was addressed and 

discussed at the Connecticut, the Pennsylvania, 

and the Virginia ratifying convention by James 

Madison, by Chief -- Chief Justice Marshall. 

It was a central concern at the time. 

And as a matter of original meaning, this sort 

of investment, this sort of property, is 

something that necessarily was subject -- taxes 

on it was subject to apportionment. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sorry.  One last 

question returning to my first one.  Apologies 

to shift you about.

only realization requirement is some realization

 consequences of a holding like that?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  The consequences would 

be to open the door to taxation of practically

 everything.  I mean, all property that a person 

owns is the fruit of income at some point in

 time, whether it might be income, you know, that

 they received long in the past.

 I mean, ultimately, all property that 

we have is made up of flows of income that have 

then been invested.  And so, if all that was 

necessary was some level of income, then 

Congress could simply point at anything and say, 

well, at some point, this was income to some 

person at some level and, therefore, can be 

subject to taxation without apportionment. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I suppose we could 

and maybe would have to draw lines as to how far 

back in -- in time one can go in assessing that 

chain of realization. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  That's right.  And I 

don't really understand how the Court would do 

that based on the constitutional text.  The 

government's definition of "income" is simply 

the increase in a person's wealth between two 

points in time.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  In your brief, to 

distinguish Subpart F and S corps and

define what you mean by "constructive 

realization." 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Sure.  We use 

"constructive realization" as a blanket term to 

encompass such concepts as constructive 

realization and assignment of income, and it 

just generally -- it refers to the general 

principle espoused in cases like Banks and like 

Horst that income should be taxed to the person 

who earns it and enjoys its benefits. 

And Congress, when it has enacted 

cases relying on that sort of doctrine, you 

know, has approached it in that nature, in other

that income to be attributed to the partner. 

I understand that partnerships are a 

different kind of form because, as an ownership 

matter, the partners would own it equally, but I 

guess I don't think our cases have established 

control as the linchpin.  Can you kind of point 

me in the right direction if you disagree?

which partnerships may put their income, such as

 distribution -- distributing it in certain

 circumstances, is no different from a state law

 preventing an individual from using their own

 income in some particular fashion, spending it 

on a particular item that they might wish to

 purchase.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But I guess I just

 mean that control -- you know, when we're 

thinking about how to define "income," I'm just 

questioning whether control can really be the --

the word to use, as opposed to just some sort of 

distinction between capital and income, you 

know, the, you know, seed and its fruit, right? 

I mean, it -- it seems to me that control might 

go a little bit too far. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I don't -- well, I --

control has always been an essential element of 

income attribution statutes because the general 

idea has to be that the taxpayer at issue has 

the ability to redirect that stream of income 

somewhere else and thereby avoid it and avoid 

taxes on it. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why isn't that a due 

process issue?  I guess this goes back to

Justice Gorsuch's point about what would the 

consequences be and we would have to draw lines. 

You said that means that something that was

 earned income anywhere along the line ultimately

 lands in, you know, my bank account and then it 

can be considered income to me.

 But is that a Sixteenth Amendment 

problem, or is that a due process problem where

 we have to draw lines about when it's fair to 

attribute one person's income to someone else? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  I think it can raise 

issues under both, but the Court has 

traditionally considered it to be a Sixteenth 

Amendment issue not only in Macomber but in 

trust cases like Corliss, where, again, the 

Court considered it a question of did the 

taxpayer have control over the -- over the --

its stream of income that he had in that case 

redirected into a trust for the benefit of his 

close family members. 

And -- I mean, that's the way the 

Court has always analyzed it, from the point of 

view of the taxpayer and whether that taxpayer 

has actually received income or not.

 about Subpart F.  I just want to be sure that I

 understand your position.

 You say that income is about whether 

the person has the ability to direct the income 

stream. Am I accurately repeating what you said

 when it's about attribution in these cases?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  I think that is a

 necessary part of it, yes.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  It's a necessary 

part of it.  And you've also said that Subpart F 

corporations in general, of which, you know, 

KisanKraft meets the definition, Subpart F 

corporations and Subpart F do not pose the same 

Sixteenth Amendment problem that you see here, 

right? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  We -- we think that --

oh, you -- do you mean with respect to the 

application of Subpart F aside from the MRT? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yes. 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And is that 

because -- kind of going back to your point 

about control, is the distinction then between

more ability to direct the stream?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think it's two

 things.  It's not that they have more ability;

 it's that they have any ability, because, again,

 under the terms of the statute, the MRT doesn't 

take account as to whether or not a shareholder

 exercised control while that stream of income

 was coming in the door.  It only focuses on

 ownership in 2017. 

But also, that degree of control has 

also been -- has also been combined historically 

with the question of whether or not the types of 

income being taxed are those that are 

susceptible to that sort of abuse such that 

attribution is appropriate. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: You mean so there's 

some sort of like fraud overlay to this, like is 

this really functioning as a tax shelter, as 

Justice Kagan was pointing out? 

MR. GROSSMAN: That's how Congress 

addressed it in the very first --

very first income tax statute.  That provision

 regarding fraudulent availment of corporations

 to avoid income was specifically limited 

specifically by many of the chief proponents of

 the Sixteenth Amendment to avoid the precise

 question that we're addressing -- the -- the 

precise defect that we're addressing today.

 Their view was that you could not 

ordinarily attribute corporate income to 

shareholders but could do so only in the 

instance where there was some sort of fraudulent 

abuse of a corporation to avoid income.  And 

that's --

Jackson?

in your conversation with Justice Gorsuch about 

the sort of original meaning of the direct tax 

clause, and I'm trying to understand whether 

it's your position that as -- as an original 

matter, the direct tax clause was interpreted to 

include income and all sorts of things, or was 

it narrow.

in the Hylton case, that it was pretty narrowly

 wrong about that?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  The Hylton case had

 three seriatim opinions.  Two of them viewed it

 as a consumption tax regarding conveyance of 

persons. The third of them, by Justice Iredell, 

adopted the view that, well, if it's difficult 

to apportion something, then it should not be 

subject to apportionment. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What about Justice 

Patterson's explanation that this was a pretty 

narrow clause and that it was designed to 

protect southern states and slavery from federal 

interference, that that was really what was 

going on here, and, therefore, when you're 

looking at direct taxes, you're talking about --

or direct, yeah, taxes, as opposed to indirect, 

you're talking about certain kinds of things and 

that it's not necessarily others, income and 

that sort of thing? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think, as a 

matter of original meaning, that's incorrect. 

But I would note in the context of that opinion 

it was dicta. It certainly didn't stand for the 

position of the Court.

ask you about realization, going back to Justice

 Thomas -- Thomas's very first question, and what

 the definition is.

 I guess I'm trying to understand 

whether you think Congress has the authority to

 define what constitutes realization or not. Is 

that something you are giving to the Court 

through constitutional interpretation, or who --

who gets to decide what the realization line is? 

MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think, as an 

initial matter, yes, I mean, Congress does get 

deference on that.  But it actually has to try 

to do that, which is not what it did in this 

case. I mean, again, the tax here on its face 

turns on ownership of property on a particular 

date, and it doesn't take into account it would 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I guess I don't 

understand your answer.  If Congress -- could we 

find that there is realization in this case, 

that there is realization?  Like, who -- who

 appreciating?

 MR. GROSSMAN:  I mean, the government

 has never argued that there's realization in

 this case.  The government has simply presented

 its alternate -- the other argument that

 realization is not required.  So I think it

 would be unusual for the Court to reach out and 

decide a question of that import without the 

government actually having addressed it. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But would -- are you 

asking us to -- maybe I'm -- let me put it this

client wins in this case?  If we disagree with 

you about what "realization" means, do you lose?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The MRT is firmly grounded in the 

Sixteenth Amendment's text and history.  The 

amendment allows Congress to impose taxes on 

incomes.  That phrase had a well-established 

meaning drawn from numerous preratification 

income taxes that Congress enacted before this 

Court's decision in Pollock. 

Several of those taxes were like the 

MRT in that they taxed shareholders on 

undistributed corporate earnings, including the 

income taxes in 1864, 1865, 1867, and 1870.  And

this Court upheld Congress's power to impose

 those taxes in Hubbard.

 The Sixteenth Amendment's drafters,

 therefore, would have understood taxes on 

incomes to include taxes like the MRT.

           That's confirmed by the very first 

income tax Congress enacted under the Sixteenth

 Amendment.  That 1913 law taxed certain

 shareholders on their pro rata shares of 

undistributed corporate earnings. And the trend 

of pass-through taxation has continued 

throughout the next century from taxes on 

partners to S Corporation shareholders, to 

foreign corporation shareholders under 

Subpart F. 

Against all that history, Petitioners 

stake their case on Macomber.  But the Court has 

limited Macomber to taxes on particular stock 

dividends that are not at issue here.  If the 

Court now extended Macomber's discussion to 

invalidate all taxes on undistributed business 

earnings, it would cause a sea change in the 

operation of the Tax Code and cost several

provision of the Tax Code could be saved under a 

theory of constructive realization, but they

 don't provide a comprehensive definition of that 

term or explain why it would rescue every

 provision except the MRT.

 My friend today said it's a blanket 

term that's defined by the circumstances where

 you can say that constructive realization

 occurred.  But that's simply circular. 

And by conceding constructive 

realization, they've acknowledged Congress's 

power to draw reasonable lines about what counts 

as income and who can be taxed on it, which is 

exactly what Congress did in the MRT. 

Finally, the Court doesn't actually 

need to resolve any fundamental questions in 

this case about whether the Sixteenth Amendment 

requires realization.  The MRT taxes income that 

was actually realized by the foreign 

corporations, and Congress permissibly 

attributed the tax on that realized income to 

U.S. shareholders just as it has done in any 

number of pass-through taxes throughout our 

nation's history.  The Court could say only that 

and affirm.

I welcome the Court's questions.

           JUSTICE THOMAS: When you say 

"realized," "it has been realized," what do you

 mean by that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that this

 is a paradigmatic case of realization, Justice 

Thomas, insofar as the thing that's being taxed, 

the underlying tax base for the MRT, are the

 earnings that actually were -- came into the 

corporation, the foreign corporation's coffers. 

So the tax base here was the 

substantial ordinary business income that the 

foreign corporation generated through its 

operations in the foreign country and that has 

to date been subject to tax deferral. 

That income has never been taxed at 

the corporate or entity level.  Instead, what 

Congress did in the MRT is enact a pass-through 

tax that attributed the liability on that actual 

income that was realized to the U.S. 

shareholders. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Outside of that 

context of the MRT, do you think that the --

just the -- the increase in value of real 

property could be a taxable event?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that

 that raises a more difficult question.  This 

presses on the idea of whether you can

 characterize gains in the form of appreciation

 as income that's taxable.

 I think that there's a strong argument

 that that falls within a definition of "income"

 that looks to whether there have been economic

 gains over time, and it's important to note that 

Congress has at various time imposed taxes on 

that kind of appreciation. 

Some of the Civil War era income tax 

laws that I pointed to at the beginning of my 

introduction had appreciation-based taxation for 

certain property like livestock, and still today 

there are really important provisions of the Tax 

Code that effects -- effectively tax individuals 

on appreciation.  For example, the 

mark-to-market taxes that my friend has conceded 

are constitutional treat a taxpayer as though 

there was a realizable event at the end of the 

tax year for certain futures contracts, for 

certain life insurance holdings, securities 

dealers holding, that mark the amount of the 

value to the market price even in the absence of

in value of the property. 

So, I mean, what is left to defend

 recognized as the -- at least in the beginning, 

before it certainly narrowed over time, as 

standing for the proposition that the government 

cannot tax the appreciation in -- in property.

 And you've taken that off the board in

 your presentation today.  So I -- wonder if you 

can give us a little more view or assurance in

 what's left to defend that proposition once 

you've stabbed Macomber. 

(Laughter.) 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I want to say that we're invoking this 

Court's own precedent about Macomber's scope and 

reach. It's the Court itself that said that 

Macomber is limited to the particular type of 

stock dividend at issue there.  And -- and that 

type of stock dividend didn't actually represent 

any kind of economic gain to the taxpayer. 

In other words, in Macomber, the 

taxpayer received additional shares in the 

company, but it was a stock split and her shares 

were diluted in a commensurate amount so that 

the Court said, that from the taxpayer's 

perspective, there was no difference in her

 to -- if you wanted to defend the proposition 

that the government cannot tax the appreciation

 in property without -- without any other event 

of realization, what would you cite given the

 fact that Macomber is not on the table? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, the thing 

that I would cite if the Court were looking for 

a limiting principle that takes appreciation off 

the table at least in certain circumstances 

would be history. 

I -- I do think that there is a 

different historical foundation for that type of 

tax compared to what we have here, which is a 

pass-through tax on actually realized corporate 

income. So I think that the Court could reserve 

judgment on whether there might be principled 

lines based on the history of that type of tax 

scheme to suggest that it wouldn't be what the 

Framers of the Sixteenth Amendment had in mind.

I -- I want to say at the outset I think that

 the Court could resolve this case quite

 narrowly.

           JUSTICE ALITO:  Now the -- the Ninth 

Circuit held that "The Supreme Court has made

 clear that realization of income is not a 

constitutional requirement but is instead

 founded on administrative convenience."

 Is that correct? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The Ninth Circuit 

was referring to this Court's decision in 

Cottage Savings, where the Court did say that 

realization requirements are founded on 

administrative convenience. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, not -- not the 

question whether that's a correct interpretation 

of our prior precedents.  Is it your position, 

as I understand you to argue in your brief, that 

realization is not required?  The Sixteenth 

Amendment simply permits the taxation of income 

whether realized or not? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We certainly think 

that there is no bright-line realization rule or

of unrealized gains.

 I don't want to suggest that the Court 

here needs to set out to define "income" for all 

purposes or to announce any bright-line rules

 about realization.  I think it's sufficient here 

for the Court to say that you have before you a

 particular type of tax on undistributed 

corporate earnings that were actually realized 

and to look at the history and tradition that 

demonstrates that that fits well within 

Congress's --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  General -- General 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- income tax 

authority. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what I'm trying 

to do is to understand the breadth of your 

argument, just as we need to understand the 

consequences of -- of Petitioners' argument. 

So I take it what you've said is that 

realization is not a requirement.  You say that 

explicitly in your -- in your brief, unless you 

want to walk back from that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We think they're 

wrong to say it always is a requirement.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  We don't have to 

agree with you on that for you to prevail I 

think you've said in your opening as well

 because, even assuming or leaving open whether 

realization is a constitutional requirement,

 there was realized income here to the entity, 

and then it's attributed to the shareholders in 

a manner consistent with how Congress has done 

that and this Court has allowed. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct, 

Justice Kavanaugh.  We think that here the 

constitutional question is actually quite easy 

and it doesn't require the Court to consider 

some of the foundational questions about the 

meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment in other 

consequence -- other contexts because, here, we 

have paradigmatic realized income at the entity 

level, and this functions just like the 

pass-through taxes on partnerships, the taxes on 

other types of corporate shareholders, 

S Corporation shareholders, and, particularly in 

the context of foreign corporations, the tax 

under Subpart F of which the MRT is just a part.

JUSTICE ALITO:  So your answer is that

 there need not be realization by the taxpayer;

 it's sufficient if there's realization by some

 other entity, correct?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Under the Sixteenth 

Amendment, that's correct, although there is a 

due process question in that context about the 

limits on Congress's ability to attribute income 

that was realized by one taxpayer to another 

taxpayer. 

JUSTICE ALITO: All right.  That --

the due process question and that's a question 

of substantive due process. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's how this 

Court has analyzed it in cases like Burnet 

versus Wells, where it was looking at the limits 

on Congress's ability to make that kind of 

attribution decision. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And anything under 

substantive due process involving an economic 

regulation like this, the only thing that would 

need to be shown is that it was rational for 

Congress to do what it did? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  The Court has 

looked at whether Congress has made an arbitrary

choice, whether it's acted unreasonably.  But I 

think that the Court's precedents reveal that 

the Court really has looked at whether the 

taxpayer who owes the tax liability has a

 relationship to the underlying income.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if this -- if

 it's a rational basis review, then that's not

 much, right?  So we could say the 30-year

 requirement here is a substantive due process 

issue, so we don't have to grapple with it here. 

But, to be honest, we would be saying, 

you know, unless you can show it was irrational, 

that would be sufficient. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I want to be 

precise about the doctrine here. You mentioned 

the 30-year lookback period. I think that that 

actually has to do with retroactivity principles 

under the Due Process Clause, and I think that 

that's some -- somewhat different than the 

attribution question that we had been discussing 

about whether Congress can fairly attribute tax 

liability to one person for income that was 

earned at the entity level. 

I recognize that maybe there are some 

complicated questions out there that could exist

in this space, but the important point is that 

here we have an enormous amount of history and

 tradition on our side to support the idea that

 this particular attribution decision falls well

 within constitutional bounds.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I -- I 

understand you want to talk about this case, 

and, ultimately, we have to talk about this 

case, but I just want to understand how far your 

argument goes, how far does it logically go. 

So, under your argument, does the 

Sixteenth Amendment allow the taxation -- it 

allows the taxation of income, and you define 

income as an increase in -- an economic gain 

between two points in time. 

So let's say that somebody graduates 

from school and starts up a little business in 

his garage, and 20 years later, 30 years later, 

the person is a billionaire.  Can Congress --

under your argument, can Congress tax all of 

that on the ground that it's income? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, if that has 

already been taxed, as I imagine it would 

through annual income taxes, then it sounds to 

me like the hypothetical is actually functioning

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Now the Court

 might conclude if it was --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- General --

General, I'm sorry to interrupt, but on this

 point, in -- in your brief at least, and I

 understand your argument is a little bit

 different here today, but in your brief at 

least, you confronted the -- the -- the question 

whether Congress could tax millions of Americans 

who hold small amounts of stock in their 

retirement investment accounts, and you say yes, 

and you point to the 19 -- 1864 Civil War laws. 

And then you say, but that would be 

administratively unworkable. 

So, as I understood at least in your 

brief, the answer to Justice Alito's question, I 

think, is, yes, that could happen. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think this is 

a really important point, Justice Gorsuch, and 

let me clarify that that statement in the brief 

was referring to the idea of pass-through 

taxation on all large -- or -- or -- or all 

corporate shareholders.

That would function like the MRT. The

 earnings.  And then the shareholders would be

 responsible for a pro rata share of the

 corporation's earnings.  That's a different type

dealing with, was the change in value over time 

and stock prices increase.  Could you tax that 

unrealized -- otherwise what we'd consider 

unrealized gain, treat that as a realized gain? 

And -- and the answer is yes because they did 

that in 1864 and because, if there's any 

limitation, it has to do with administrative 

workability.

 not based on the appreciation in the shares but 

rather was based on what the corporation had

 actually earned as its income.  I --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And I don't want to 

suggest that a tax on appreciation in stock

 would necessarily be invalid.  As I had 

mentioned to Justice Thomas, there are 

provisions on the books today that my friends 

concede are constitutional. 

But let me say that to the extent that 

this question and Justice Alito's question is 

pressing on the idea that maybe this kind of 

appreciation should just be beyond the reach of 

Congress's taxing power --

JUSTICE GORSUCH: No, I'm -- I'm just 

asking what the limits of your argument are, and 

-- and it -- it seems to me there are none. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I certainly 

think that Congress has broad taxing power.  And 

what I was about to say is that here the 

relevant question is not whether Congress has 

the power to tax in the first place.  The Court 

has said Congress has plenary power.  It can tax

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And if I could --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- whether that's a

 direct tax that has to be apportioned --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure.

 JUSTICE PRELOGAR:  -- or whether it's 

subject to the rule of uniformity as an indirect

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And if I might 

address what I now perceive to be kind of a 

backup argument, so the first argument, the 

brief argument, is no realization requirement. 

Today, I'm hearing, well, even if there is 

realization, there was somewhere-in-the-chain 

realization, and then Congress can attribute it 

freely as it wishes. 

And I -- I understand that argument, 

but I'm not sure how we fit it with our 

precedent.  If we ditch Macomber, I -- I 

understand your argument.  But let's assume 

Macomber isn't completely misguided, okay?  I

 Macomber's framework and talking about is it 

fair to say that there was realization to the

 taxpayer, not realization somewhere back in the 

chain of history and income realized by the 

corporation or a parent or a subsidiary or

 whomever.

 And -- just as a matter of precedent 

now I'm talking, what -- what -- what's mistaken

 about that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, in those 

subsequent cases, I wouldn't say that the Court 

was mistaken there. It did happen to find a 

realization on the facts of those particular 

cases to the --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  For the taxpayer, 

right? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  For the taxpayer. 

Of course, they involved different types of tax. 

None of those cases involved a pass-through tax. 

And so I think, looking at what is maybe the 

closest precedent to the situation that we have 

here, I'd point to the Court's decision in 

Heiner versus Mellon, which considered the 

propriety of the tax on partners even in a 

circumstance where they couldn't actually access

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I was about 

to say there are two ways to think about it. 

One is to say that there was a realized income 

at the entity level, and Congress can 

permissibly attribute that to the taxpayer. 

Another way to look at it would be to 

say that the taxpayer has a close enough 

relationship to that underlying income for 

Congress to permissibly treat it as income to 

the taxpayer itself.

that argument before us.  What do we do about 

that? That argument hasn't been made.

situation or a fraud situation or an

 S Corporation situation.  We -- we've been clear

 about that, that -- that -- that there's some 

enjoyment that the taxpayer has over that money,

 some control.  He may assign it elsewhere.  He 

may choose to keep it in the S Corp, whatever,

 but he controls it.

 And so there's some realization under 

Macomber's framework that's enough.  But that 

argument that this taxpayer had that kind of 

enjoyment isn't in the briefs before us.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And I'm just

did make that argument because we made the point 

that to the extent the Court goes down the road 

of recognizing some theory of constructive 

realization, then the MRT would fit within that 

same framework because Petitioners haven't 

identified any actual distinction between how 

those other tax contexts operate and how the MRT

affirm because, here, we made the argument that 

there is the same level of control and exactly 

the same relationship as in Subpart F.

 So we did make this argument, Justice

 Gorsuch.  We made the point that, if the Court 

is focused on things like control or influence,

 that there is no relevant distinction with

 Subpart F because this is taxing in precisely

 the same way as Subpart F operates. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And, General, what 

do you think is the significance of Petitioners' 

concession that Subpart F is constitutional to 

your point?  If any? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that that 

is an incredibly significant concession here 

because it demonstrates that even if the Court 

were to apply a lens of control or influence, I 

think the right word to use would be 

relationship to the income, Petitioners have 

acknowledged that 10 percent U.S. shareholders 

have the requisite level of relationship in 

order to properly have income attributed to 

them. 

Now my friend suggested that there's 

some fundamental difference with Subpart F

 because it taxes different types of income.  I

 think he said it's income where you can

 interpose the corporate form.

 I -- I -- I don't understand that 

distinction because, of course, the Sixteenth

 Amendment says that Congress can tax all income

 from whatever source derived.  So the Sixteenth 

Amendment's text by its own terms makes clear 

that the different forms of income being taxed 

don't make a relevant constitutional difference. 

And even if you look at it as a 

factual matter, my friend's argument doesn't 

withstand scrutiny because he suggested that, 

for example, all of this income could have been 

earned by the taxpayer himself.  But that 

doesn't explain many important features of 

Subpart F, like ensuring risks outside the --

the country of incorporation for the CFC or 

doing business in countries that are subject to 

U.S. sanctions. 

Those are parts of Subpart F income, 

and I don't think that there is a relevant 

distinction with respect to whether it could be 

properly attributed to the taxpayer.

I'm asking the Court to follow its precedent

discussion in that case was limited to the

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- I just --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- you just disagree

GENERAL PRELOGAR: I disagree with 

that reading of those cases because I think, if

Macomber itself had articulated. 

Take, for example, Bruun.  That was a 

case where I think you said the Court was --

said it was faithfully applying its 

interpretation of income, but -- but the Court 

in Bruun specifically disavowed the aspect of 

Macomber that said you have to be able to 

separate the economic gain from the underlying

you think it was deluding itself, but that's how 

the Court perceived what it was doing.

 Shouldn't that count for something?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But look at the

 Court's statements in Griffiths. There, the

 Court said that Macomber's theoretical bases had 

been undermined, that it had "in effect been 

limited to the particular type of stock dividend 

at issue" there and that it didn't have 

controlling weight even with respect to other 

types of stock dividends --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- let alone other 

types of economic gains. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- so what do you 

understand to be the current state of our 

precedent?  I mean --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- at a certain point, 

you said, well, Macomber was confronting 

something that that stock dividend had no 

economic consequence whatsoever. And that was 

true, and that could have been.  I mean, 

Macomber could have been decided in a paragraph 

saying that, but that's not what the Court did.

Then, as you say, there are many cases

 following Macomber which basically leave 

Macomber's own theory of realization in the

 dust, but what do you -- what do you take to be 

the current state of our precedent that we need 

to pay attention to?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that if

 this Court had before it another stock dividend 

case that involved an economically substanceless 

split, then Macomber would control.  That's what 

Griffiths said.  Macomber's limited to that 

particular type of stock dividend. 

But the Court itself in any number of 

follow-on cases had said that Macomber doesn't 

have controlling weight outside that context. 

The Court said in Glenshaw Glass the statements 

in Macomber were not intended to provide a 

touchstone for resolving all future gross income 

questions that could arise. 

So I think, to the extent that that 

leaves Macomber as a bit of an island unto 

itself, that is just the natural effect of this 

Court's subsequent precedent, and we're asking 

the Court to follow that precedent here.

most on point for you I think you said is 

Heiner, right, the partnership case? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  I 

think it involved the most analogous tax to the

 MRT.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And why --

 explain -- explain why that dictates the result 

here or strongly supports the result here from 

your perspective since you -- that's the one 

you're relying on most, I think. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It strongly 

supports the result in this case because, in 

Heiner, the Court confronted a situation where 

partners claimed they could not lawfully be 

taxed on partnership income on a pass-through 

basis because state law operated to preclude any 

distributions of that partnership income to 

them. So, by definition, under state law, the 

partners were not going to personally realize 

that income.  State law prohibited the 

distribution. 

And the Court rejected the claim from 

the partners and said that it didn't make a 

difference with respect to the permissibility of 

that pass-through tax from the partnership

entity level to the partners themselves.

           Now Petitioners have suggested that

 partnerships can just be distinguished down the 

line because they say that partnerships have a

 different legal status than corporations.

 But it's not like partnerships have an

 innate legal status.  Instead, they're creatures 

of state law, and there are any number of states

 out there that define a partnership as distinct 

from the underlying partners themselves. 

We also have good case law that 

governs Subpart F in the lower courts.  This has 

been applied in numerous additional contexts 

involving pass-through taxation and corporations 

in particular, and it's not just the modern 

laws, Justice Kavanaugh, it is all of the 

history here. 

For virtually the entirety of this 

nation's experience with an income tax, there 

have been laws on the book other than the brief 

period when Pollock governed where Congress has 

taxed corporate income at the shareholder level. 

That is a classic pass-through tax and it's how

going to ask you, if Heiner is closest on this 

pass-through point, what's your best federal 

case upholding a federal tax on appreciation, or 

do you have one? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I don't have a 

case from this Court that upholds a tax on 

appreciation.  I think there are some -- some 

lower court cases that have considered things 

like accrual accounting or other situations. 

There are fewer taxes that reach appreciation. 

I think the pass-through mechanism is the more 

common one when we're thinking about gains that 

aren't realized to the taxpayer himself.  But 

there are, I think, a variety of -- of taxes out

there and have been through history.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Like the

 mark-to-market one you were referencing before?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Exactly.  And it's 

really important to recognize the importance of

 being able to tax in that context.

 The situation that Congress confronted

 that prompted it to enact these mark-to-market 

taxes is the fact that taxpayers can often 

manipulate realization events. 

So, for example, they can enter into 

offsetting futures contracts that don't really 

have any economic substance to them but allow 

the taxpayer to hold on to the one that has a 

gain, to defer taxation, maybe get favorable 

capital gains rates, and to sell the one that's 

a loss and thereby immediately have a taxable 

event. And Congress recognized that that was 

a -- a loophole in the Tax Code that could 

enable this kind of -- of abuse. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So there are taxes 

like the mark-to-market one that tax based on 

appreciation, but it's fair to say that we would 

be doing something new if we accepted your 

argument that income is any kind of economic

 gain, appreciation included?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I appreciate the 

opportunity to clarify because we are not

 actually asking the Court to define "income"

 that way.

 I think, if there is a lesson to be

 drawn from Macomber, it's that there's a real

 danger in trying to -- to, as an abstract 

matter, define "income" for all purposes or to, 

you know, as -- as Glenshaw Glass said, to 

provide a touchstone for all future cases, in 

part because our experience with the Tax Code is 

that taxpayers often latch on to those 

statements and use it as a basis to try to avoid 

taxation going forward. 

So I don't think that the Court needs 

to approach this issue by adopting some global 

or universal definition of "income."  The 

Internal Revenue Code itself doesn't define 

"income."  Instead, it says that income is all 

income from whatever sources realized and then 

gives some illustrative examples. 

I don't think my friends are offering 

the Court a definition of "income" because they 

say income is realized gains or maybe some

 comprehensively define it here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. I understood your answer to Justice 

Barrett to be the same as the answer that you

property, that you didn't have any authority to 

support that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  I'm 

not pointing to a case from this Court that I 

think would find that that's taxable.  There's 

also nothing from this Court, other than reading 

Macomber for all it's worth, that I think would

 ahistorical.

 So I think there's a lot of wisdom in

 following the approach the Court articulated in

 Griffiths, where the Court said we don't rule on 

the constitutionality of a tax until we find

 that Congress has actually laid that tax.  I

 think the Court should take each tax as it comes

Petitioners' favor, then large, important pieces

think that's a fair argument.  But I think it's 

also a fair argument to do the same thing with 

your position, and I want to understand the 

limits of your position.

and that the Sixteenth Amendment -- realization 

to the taxpayer is not required, and, therefore,

 the Sixteenth Amendment allows the taxation of

 income.  And you seem to define "income" in your 

brief as economic gain between two points in

 time, and you say it is that -- those

 well-established principles that distinguish 

income taxes from property taxes.

 So, if that is correct, then what

in mutual funds over a period of time without 

selling the -- the shares in those mutual funds? 

Can those be taxed under the Sixteenth

method of taxation. But your answer is that

 would probably -- you'll at least go that far --

that would probably be permissible under your

 interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment?

           GENERAL PRELOGAR: I think it probably 

would, but I think the Court could draw lines 

based on history, and if there truly were a 

widespread tax on all amount of appreciation for

 every taxpayer, that wouldn't look like anything 

Congress has done before.  The Court has 

sometimes used history like that to draw 

principled lines. 

Here, we have exactly the opposite 

situation where Congress has enacted a tax that 

looks exactly like any number of pass-through 

taxes through history.  So, here, I think 

history functions as a rule of inclusion with 

respect to the propriety of this tax. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, as to the -- the 

Chief Justice's question, how about the 

appreciation in value of real property? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think it would be 

subject to the same analysis that would fit 

within a conception of income as economic gain 

between two points in time.  But Congress hasn't

 traditionally taxed that, and so perhaps the 

Court, if it were confronted with that 

situation, would conclude that there is a 

historical line or limiting principle here.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, unless history

 rules that out, I'm not quite sure how 

Congress's failure to enact a tax in the past 

brings that outside the Sixteenth Amendment if 

the tax would otherwise fall within the 

Sixteenth Amendment, but you say that that 

potentially is also taxable as income under your 

theory? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I think 

it's clearly taxable under the Constitution. 

Again, this is not a question about Congress's 

power. It's about the mode of taxation and 

whether to apportion that tax or not. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if some sort of 

constructive realization or some test for 

attribution is required, what is your test?  How 

far may Congress go in attributing income to 

someone who has not realized that income in the 

standard understanding of that term?

which presents the most closely analogous

 situation.  A taxpayer argued that because he 

had been the grantor of a trust, he couldn't be

 held liable for the gains in the trust, it 

couldn't properly be attributed to him because

 he had no continuing control and wouldn't 

personally enjoy those gains, which instead went

 to the beneficiaries. 

This Court rejected that claim, and 

what it said is that Congress had not acted 

arbitrarily.  In making that attribution 

decision, it looked at the taxpayer's 

relationship to the underlying income and 

concluded that there was good reason to tax the 

grantor in that circumstance, including to avoid 

shifting income to lower-income taxpayers. 

But, if the Court were applying that 

kind of attribution analysis here, I think the 

MRT, like many pass-through taxes, is equally 

constitutional.  Here, the income has never been 

taxed at the entity level, and there are real 

complications with trying to tax foreign 

corporations directly.  So, in many respects, 

these large U.S. shareholders who, by 

definition, together collectively have a

in many senses the most suitable person or

 entity to tax.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, have we ever

 said -- and maybe we should in this case say --

that the Sixteenth Amendment applies differently

 to income or property that is obtained abroad 

than it does to income or property possessed 

within the United States? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The Court hasn't 

previously said to that, but my friend himself 

suggests that in thinking about these issues, 

the Court should focus on the potential for tax 

avoidance or tax abuse. 

And I think that that concession just 

underscores the point that when you are using a 

foreign corporation, it provides a ready vehicle 

to shelter funds offshore, keep them out of the 

reach of U.S. taxing authorities, and, thus, 

complicate efforts to access those funds even 

when they have a really significant connection, 

as they do here, because these companies are 

majority owned by U.S. taxpayers. 

And it's important to recognize too 

that this case is not the paradigmatic case of

how the MRT applies.  The overwhelming majority 

of taxpayers subject to this are domestic 

corporations, often parent companies of wholly

 owned foreign subsidiaries who have arranged

 their affairs to be able to keep this money

 offshore, to a period of long tax deferral.  But 

I think that it would be anomalous to suggest

 that the money is forever out of the reach of

 U.S. taxing authority. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now the -- the 

Petitioners were in on the ground floor with 

this corporation, but what if they had simply 

bought into the company the day before the MRT 

made taxes due?  Wouldn't that look an awful lot 

like a tax on capital rather than a tax on 

income in any sense of the word? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I have three 

reactions to that.  I think that the underlying 

nature of what's being taxed, which are the 

realized earnings of the corporation, wouldn't 

change.  I do think that raises a harder 

attribution question because that taxpayer would 

have less of a direct relationship to the thing 

that's being taxed, and so maybe someone in that 

situation would have a better as-applied due

process claim. As you mentioned, the Moores

 themselves aren't in that position.

 The second thing I would say is that 

if the Court is interested in exploring this

 as-applied due process issue, it's important to 

note that the MRT is not unique in this regard.

 There are other taxes in other contexts where

 the Court has recognized that someone can be

 taxed on gain in property that happened before 

the ownership stake was obtained.  That was the 

holding in Taft versus Bowers, where the Court 

considered this issue with respect to the gift 

tax. It's also how Subpart F itself can 

operate.  You can buy shares in the controlled 

foreign corporation and be taxed under Subpart F 

with respect to earnings that happened before 

you bought your stake. 

The third point I would make is that 

as a factual matter, this situation is unlikely 

to arise, and that's because Congress has 

enacted other provisions of the code that 

largely tie the gains to the person who owned 

the shares at the relevant time. This is 26 

U.S.C. Section 1248, and it taxes gains at the 

time of sale.  So, in your hypothetical, in --

 seller as though they were paid out of the

 retained corporate earnings.

 Hubbard upheld that exercise of

 would have been well aware of this pass-through

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- do you think

distinction between direct and indirect taxes? 

Do you think that the Court decided that

discussion of this issue is brief.  I don't 

think that it parsed the constitutional text 

that way, although it did say that this was

I don't think it would be right to say that

 Pollock was the last word on it, of course,

JUSTICE ALITO:  And the Court entirely

 missed it? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: Maybe they missed 

an opportunity to make a good argument in that

 case. But I think, ultimately --

(Laughter.)

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- the important

 point is -- is that relying on Pollock and

 trying to parse Pollock versus Hubbard ignores 

the effect of the Sixteenth Amendment. 

You know, this was -- this was an 

amendment to the Constitution that was 

specifically designed to restore a pre-existing 

power, and the right way to look at how that --

what that power means is to look at how it had 

actually been exercised before.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You started by

 suggesting a narrow ruling.  I think there are 

two ways to narrowly rule. Tell me why one is

 better than the other if at all, okay, but,

 first, we can say there is a realization 

requirement, and, here, it was realized because

 the corporation realized it.  You have to deal 

with Justice Gorsuch's concern that you waive

 that argument.  I may disagree with him, but 

that we can work out among ourselves. 

But the bottom line, we could rule 

that way, or we could do it the way Justice 

Kavanaugh started his question, which is we 

assume that there's a realization requirement 

and -- and it was met here. 

So which of the two ways should we do 

it and -- and how not -- and why not? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It would be 

critically important for the Court to do it 

through Justice Kavanaugh's approach.  That is, 

I don't think the Court needs to resolve 

anything about whether the Sixteenth Amendment 

requires realization.  Here, we happen to have 

it, and this kind of tax corresponds to 

pass-through taxes we've had through history,

and that suffices to resolve this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We have serious

 concerns with the Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that -- the

 history is that Congress can attribute that 

realization?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Correct, that 

Congress can attribute that realization by the 

corporation to the shareholders and there are 

taxes that look like that at virtually all 

points in our nation's history. 

The reason why I would strongly 

caution the Court away from adopting a 

realization requirement is not only that we 

think that it is inaccurate, profoundly 

ahistorical, inconsistent with the text of the 

Sixteenth Amendment, but it would also wreak 

havoc on the proper operation of the Tax Code. 

I think that there are pass-through 

taxes that would withstand scrutiny if the Court 

affirms the attribution holding, but, as I had 

mentioned to Justice Barrett, there are a number 

of critically important provisions of the code 

that don't actually have that kind of

 pass-through mechanism and don't turn on

 realization at all.

 That includes the mark-to-market 

taxes, original issued discount on bonds that

 drives prices in bond markets and avoids what

 could otherwise be sheltering of income that

 should be taxable.  It includes the expatriation 

tax when people renounce their United States

 citizenship. 

So I think that there are various ways 

in which adopting any form of a realization 

requirement would have profound practical 

consequences, and it's unnecessary for the Court 

to go down that road in light of the serious 

legal arguments against that reading.

What do you worry about and why?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I worry that none 

of those proposals actually hold up and provide 

a basis to distinguish the MRT. So, at first, 

he suggests it has to do with control. But, as

 I had explained to Justice Barrett before, the

 level of control here is exactly the same as

 under Subpart F.

 These are 10 percent shareholders, 

U.S. shareholders of closely held foreign 

corporations, and so control cannot be the 

relevant difference.  It's also not the 

difference with respect to partnerships and 

S Corporation shareholders who might have even a 

lower than 10 percent stake and nevertheless can 

have income attributed to them. 

Then he says maybe the answer is 

consent, and he points to S Corporations and 

says that turns on a theory of consent.  But I 

don't think that that works either because, to 

the extent that there's any kind of realization 

requirement out there in the Sixteenth 

Amendment, consent couldn't cure that difficulty 

or give taxpayers a basis to allow Congress to 

tax things that are outside its authority, and

it doesn't even work as a descriptive matter

 because the S Corporation shareholders might buy

 their interest in the company and never

 personally consent to pass-through taxation, or 

they might change their minds and remove their 

consent and say I don't want to be taxed on it

 anymore, but if they have a minority stake in 

the company, they're stuck with it and continue

 to have pass-through taxation.  So I don't think 

consent works. 

Then he says maybe it has something to 

do with the type of income under Subpart F. 

But, as I've explained before, we don't think 

that the type of income matters under the 

Sixteenth Amendment.  And, here, this is 

paradigmatic income.  This is ordinary business 

income, substantial earnings realized by the 

company.  And I think it would be a really 

anomalous result to say this type of income 

uniquely is exempt from pass-through taxation. 

He also suggests that maybe it turns 

on the potential for abuse and maybe that 

explains some of these other taxes.  But there 

again, I think that the -- the MRT itself 

responds to the concern that these domestic

 corporations in the main, also some individual 

shareholders, have been able to keep the money 

offshore in the closely held foreign 

corporations and thereby defer taxation on them.

 So, with respect to every possible 

point of difference, we just don't think it

 holds up as a descriptive matter, and so there's 

a real concern we have that if the Court goes 

down one of these roads and nevertheless 

invalidates the MRT, it's not a principled

should we think about that set of possibilities?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think the 

important starting point is to recognize that

 those are hypotheticals, as you mentioned, that

 are unlikely to ever come to pass.

 There's a really good reason that 

Congress frequently chooses to tax based on

 realization, and it's the administrative

 practicalities of the situation.  Otherwise, 

it's complicated to track fluctuations in value 

over time or to engage in a valuation analysis 

for assets that might be hard to value. 

So, in the main, Congress frequently 

does choose to rely on realization, and I think 

some of the hypotheticals about taxing all 

people who have shares or taxing all home 

appreciation are unlikely ever to come to pass. 

But I also think that it's important 

for the Court to not rely on concerns about 

those types of far-fetched hypotheticals to 

announce bright-line rules about what the 

Sixteenth Amendment requires that could actually 

take down critically important provisions of the

 In particular, many of the times when 

Congress has chosen to tax in the absence of 

realization, it's because taxpayers can abuse

 the rules. They can manipulate realization 

events, or they can make use of certain

 structures or financial instruments to shield 

assets from taxation. And any coherent or

 proper administration of the Tax Code has to be 

able to respond to that kind of taxpayer abuse.

of your argument here as well about there's no 

difference between income and that -- and that

you're familiar with the, you know, the 1918 tax 

cases obviously.  The government's brief in that 

case, one of my industrious law clerks pulled 

it, and there, the government does draw that 

distinction and says that that kind of capital 

gain is not income because the individual 

received, the taxpayer received, nothing, and 

that's not income.  It's a mere gain of or loss 

of capital value.  Are you familiar with that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I'm not sure 

exactly which brief you're talking about.  Do 

you happen to know the case?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  It's the 19 

-- the Solicitor General's brief in the 1918 

income tax cases, and it's pages 32 and 53.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I would have to 

look at the particular issue that was being

 considered there.  There are a number of

 statutory realization requirements that could

 explain those statements.  There have also been

 a lot of evolution in the -- the thinking about 

these issues following Macomber. 

I recognize that the -- the government 

has sometimes taken a broader view of Macomber 

itself, for example, but that was in an era when 

the Court itself had been unclear about the 

reach of Macomber before the Court has sharply 

limited it. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And then I do 

think there is room for some narrow ground, as 

-- as Justice Sotomayor suggested.  You -- you 

-- if one thinks that the question is 

attribution you call it -- I think your friend 

on the other side would call it is it realized 

by the taxpayer.  You say is it fairly 

attributed to the taxpayer.  Potato/potato, I --

I sometimes wonder.

Again, I may be missing it. I don't

assume that argument hasn't yet been made, okay? 

What do I do? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I agree, Justice 

Gorsuch, that we haven't made the argument 

expressly in terms of control because we don't 

think that's the right standard. But we very 

clearly did make the argument that the MRT is 

constitutional for the very same reasons --

can affirm on an alternative ground, even one 

that the party didn't raise.  The Court said 

that in Dahda versus United States, for example. 

So I think it would be open for the Court to 

affirm on that ground because we do think it's a 

very strong argument, and I would encourage the 

Court to do so.

 Sixteenth Amendment.  But of all of our cases,

 whether we're talking about partnerships or you 

want to talk about S corps or -- or Schedule F, 

have treated it as whether it's a form of income

 to the taxpayer under the Sixteenth Amendment.

 That's how we've grounded our analysis so far. 

It would seem quite a change to move it over to

 due process.  Can you -- can you react to that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Sure.  So I think, 

actually, the Court's central case on 

attribution was a due process case.  This is 

Burnet versus Wells.  It involved the grantor of 

a trust.  And the Court there put it explicitly 

in due process terms. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, you mentioned 

partnership earlier, and -- and I went back and 

looked at that, and due process, those words 

don't -- you said that's --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- the best case for 

you. Those words just don't appear anywhere 

in the -- in Justice Brandeis's opinion. It's 

all about whether it's -- you can call it fairly 

attributable or realized by the partner.

it's perfectly fine for the Court to look at 

this through the lens of the Sixteenth Amendment 

because you get to the same ultimate result, 

which is that, ultimately, the question then

 would be can Congress fairly attribute this 

income to you, the taxpayer. And, here, we have 

overwhelming history and tradition going all the

 way back to the 1860s and 1870s demonstrating

 that, yes, Congress can. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And are some of 

those factors that you'd look at whether they 

control the -- the -- the entity, whether 

there's some evidence of fraud in its use of the 

entity?  What else would you add to that list? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I would look at the 

taxpayer's overall relationship to the income 

and the -- and the entity. You know, I -- I 

hesitate to try to put the gloss of control on 

it for a couple of different reasons.  One is 

that I think that would incentivize taxpayers to 

try --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- to argue in an

that's necessary.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Right.  That could

 be --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm suggesting it

 might be sufficient.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I would 

absolutely agree that might be the sufficient --

that might be sufficient to establish that 

Congress made a fair attribution decision in 

that case.  I would just caution the Court away 

from constitutionalizing that or saying it's 

necessary in every case. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Roger that. What --

what other factors would you have us look at? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The other kinds of 

factors the Court has looked at or the statement 

it made in Burnet versus Wells was whether 

Congress has made an attribution decision that's 

unrelated to any privilege or benefit.  I think 

using that standard, it works for us here as 

well because there are obvious benefits 

associated with doing business through a 

controlled foreign corporation which is closely 

held and could keep the money offshore for all 

of those years subject to tax deferral.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  This was very 

helpful to me. Any other factors you'd have me

 consider?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think you have 

covered the waterfront of the things that have 

already emerged in the case law. I guess, if I

 step back to a 30,000-foot level, the one thing 

I would say is that I would urge the Court not 

to try to set down an explicit set of principles 

to govern all cases for the very reasons I was 

describing earlier, that we have seen taxpayers 

latch onto that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Roger --

avoid taxation.

certainly, I think the MRT, in addition to all

 of those other taxes, satisfy the -- the types 

of criteria that the Court has looked at that

 are relevant to this attribution question.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Whether we call it 

attribution or constructive realization?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Potato/potato.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, on that one, 

I would -- I would shy away from constructive 

realization just because I think it introduces 

an additional layer of ambiguity in the code.  I 

mean, by definition, it means not actual 

realization, and so I think that --

 And you've given me a very helpful 

list of factors from this Court's history and --

 rather than calling it all misguided, that might

 work. Fair enough?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think that 

it's right to say that this list of factors

 gives the taxpayer sufficient control over the 

assets just, again, because the concept of 

control can be inherently confusing here if it 

suggests a majority stake.  You know, the

confirm, that unlike this case, where you say 

that historical practice supports this, 

Congress's historical practice, the Court's 

cases, if there were something novel, that lack 

of historical support would at least be a strike 

against it, not dispositive necessarily. 

Is that an accurate summary of what 

you said about that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I think that 

the -- the point I was trying to make is that, 

first, yes, there are huge practical and policy 

reasons why these taxes wouldn't be enacted, 

and, second, if it came to pass, then the Court 

could assess that tax on its own terms and it 

might look to history and think, huh, this is 

something new.

think that the novelty alone would be

 dispositive, as you mentioned.  Certainly, 

Congress has some power to enact taxes that it 

hasn't enacted before, but it would certainly 

provide a reason to scrutinize that tax a little 

more carefully.

 Here, the Court doesn't have to go 

down that road because the history is all on our

 side. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One hypo of my own 

just to make sure it's covered. I think it's an 

easy one, but I want to make sure.  If there 

were a federal tax on the value of someone's 

property, you agree that's a direct tax -- or --

or on the value of someone's holdings, you agree 

that's a direct tax that would have to be 

apportioned, correct or not? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Exactly.  That's a 

quintessential tax on property because it's 

looking at the total value of the asset and it's 

doing it at a particular point of time. And 

maybe you could even levy it again and again on 

the same value, like any homeowner experiences

you're taxing the increment of gain over time 

and generally only doing it one time with any 

future tax looking to a new increment of gain 

over a new period of time.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  Last

 question.  Your position on the MRT, and you

 cite Heiner and Subpart F and -- and S corps and 

say this is all similar in kind.

 The one wrinkle -- and I just want to 

make sure we're on the same page -- is that this 

goes back a lot of years and rolls in income 

from many past years. 

What should we say about that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I have --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And -- and let me 

just add, and he says, ultimately, if you can 

just roll in, I think, income at any point in 

time, then that really becomes not much of a 

limit at all. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So let me react to 

that in a couple of different ways.  I think 

that the length of the lookback period here 

can't change the underlying character or 

classification of what's being taxed as income. 

This was actual earnings brought in by the

 company, kept in their coffers.

 If it was income in year one, then I

 don't think there's any expiration date on 

classifying it as income in a future year, and I 

think it would be anomalous for Congress to lose 

its ability to tax that as income just because 

it's granted a period of tax deferral.

 So, instead, I think that the lookback 

period, instead of relating to the Sixteenth 

Amendment or any fundamental questions about 

what income constitutes, is instead a 

retroactivity concern.  It, I think, arises 

under the Due Process Clause and would turn on 

whether Congress had a legitimate purpose for 

having this kind of lookback period and used 

rational means. 

Here, we think that that is clearly 

satisfied.  Petitioners raised a retroactivity 

due process argument below.  The court rejected 

it in the Ninth Circuit.  They haven't renewed 

it here.  And I think it's because it clearly 

fails under precedent, like United States versus 

Carlton, but, ultimately, I would urge the Court 

to -- to recognize that that is not about the 

proper characterization of the underlying tax

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I want to follow up

 on some of -- on your factors to Justice

 Gorsuch.

 So you've talked about how it could be

 fair, you know, Justice Kavanaugh just said 

S corps, partnerships, you know, an MRT, to --

and the MRT tax, to say that this is 

attributable to the shareholders or to the 

partners or, you know, to the seller of the 

trust. 

How do we know that?  Is it because 

this is closely held?  Because I assume what 

your friend on the other side is going to say 

is, well, they -- they had 10 percent, you know, 

they -- they -- they weren't majority holders, 

and so they couldn't force a distribution.  So 

how -- how would you articulate that when it can 

fairly be attributed if we're not talking due 

process, if we're talking about it from a 

Sixteenth Amendment point? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So I think,

at the outset, the -- the Court could rely on 

the lessons to be drawn from history and

 tradition here.  This functions like the early 

income taxes that I pointed to from the 1860s

 and 1870 that taxed shareholders on corporate

 income.

 At that point in our nation's history,

 corporations were generally closely held.  There 

were fewer Americans who owned stock, and so I 

think that they -- they functioned quite 

analogously to the MRT insofar as they reached a 

distinctive category of shareholders generally 

in those closely held corporations. 

You know, at the end of the day, I 

guess what I would say is that certainly, we 

think it's a factor in our favor that this 

reaches relatively large U.S. shareholders. 

It's true it's 10 percent, so they don't have to 

have a majority stake, but the premise of 

Congress is that these kinds of large 

shareholders can usually work together with 

other shareholders in this closely held 

corporation.  There aren't going to be that many 

of them to direct the company's policy or to 

force a distribution as the case may be.  And

that kind of threshold, 10 percent, appears 

throughout the law, not just in the Tax Code, 

but in the securities context, for example,

 there are additional obligations imposed on 10 

percent shareholders of companies.

 So wherever the line might be drawn in 

thinking about it from this relationship to the

 funds and level of influence of the

 corporation's policy, I think 10 percent falls 

well within the line of what should be 

recognized as permissible. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Thanks. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Jackson? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So are there 

drawbacks to setting this up in the way that 

Justice Gorsuch has articulated? I mean, I 

guess I'm a little concerned because I heard you 

respond to Justice Sotomayor by saying that one 

of your primary concerns is that we not suggest 

that realization is required. 

And would -- would -- would taking the 

approach that Justice Gorsuch has articulated 

require us to do that, or could we assume -- or 

how -- how do we get around the other caution

that you put forward?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, if I understood

 Justice Gorsuch's approach -- and I hope I'm not

 getting it wrong -- the idea behind this 

approach would be to recognize that here we 

actually have realized income, so the Court 

doesn't need to resolve the status of that under 

the Sixteenth Amendment and, instead, the 

pressure point is whether Congress could enact a 

pass-through tax on the 10 percent U.S. 

shareholders --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But is that fairly 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- that are subject 

to this income. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- is that fairly 

encompassed by this question presented?  I mean, 

this sort of goes to your discussions with 

Justice Alito, I think.  I -- I thought the 

question presented was about the extent to which 

the Sixteenth Amendment requires realization. 

So, if we're going now beyond that, 

are we out of -- out of the territory that is 

fairly encompassed here? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think so

 because I think the answer to the question

 presented would be we don't have to decide in 

all contexts here there was a realization.  And 

so, as we said in our brief in opposition to 

this case, we don't actually think that the case 

presents the question presented because here

 there was actual realization by the corporation. 

And the real dispute between the parties is 

whether Congress made a fair attribution 

decision. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let me ask you just 

another question about the government's brief. 

Why did the government make an argument about 

excise taxes at the end? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So we think that 

the MRT is clearly constitutional on an excise 

tax theory as well.  There's been some -- some 

suggestion at argument this morning that maybe 

we didn't present that argument below, and that 

is incorrect. 

In the Ninth Circuit, we said that 

even if the MRT isn't properly characterized as 

an income tax, it's not a direct tax.  And we 

said that therefore, Congress had Article I 

authority to enact it and pointed to the

 Spreckels Sugar case, which is an excise tax

 case.

 So I think we did preserve the

 argument.  The Ninth Circuit didn't have 

occasion to reach it because it ruled in our

 favor on the primary income tax argument.  But, 

if this Court had any doubt about whether this 

is a proper income tax, we think the Court could 

affirm on the excise tax argument in particular. 

And as I had mentioned in an earlier 

response, one of the important things for the 

Court to keep in mind is that 99 percent of the 

tax owed under the MRT is owed by domestic 

corporation shareholders, large U.S. companies, 

for example, that have these foreign 

subsidiaries where they've been holding money 

overseas for a number of years.  And this would 

be a tax on the privilege of doing business with 

those corporate relationships and in that 

corporate form.  So, at the very least, we'd 

urge the Court not to invalidate the MRT and all 

of its circumstances without proper 

consideration of that argument.

 circumstance under which apportionment is

 required?

           GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, exactly.  And 

I think this relates to your earlier questions, 

Justice Jackson, about the meaning of Hylton and

 about whether this can in any sense properly be

 considered a direct tax.

 You know, ultimately, I think one of 

the ways to understand the categories in the 

Constitution is in relation to one another.  And 

at the very least, this is not a tax on land. 

This is not a tax on personal property.  It's 

not a head tax.  Therefore, it's not a direct 

tax. And we think it's either an excise or an 

income tax. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  One final question 

about Macomber.  Why -- why shouldn't we take 

this opportunity to just put an end to it? I 

mean, if we were to apply the stare decisis 

factors that the Court goes through when it 

decides whether or not to formally overrule a 

precedent, doesn't Macomber fail anyway? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I agree that 

Macomber would fail those factors in an

 the Court to overrule Macomber here is because 

we just think it's inapplicable by the terms of

 subsequent precedent that have already said

 Macomber only has controlling weight with

 respect to that very specific type of stock

 dividend.

 And so I think the Court has already

 done the work here of effectively leaving 

Macomber limited --

JUSTICE JACKSON: But, if we disagree 

with you and we applied the stare decisis 

factors, you would say the government would 

still win on its view that Macomber is not good

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  If -- if this Court 

thought it were necessary to walk through the 

stare decisis factors, then, yes, I think that 

in each instance, Macomber was egregiously 

wrong. It didn't grapple with the text of the 

Sixteenth Amendment in a legitimate way or look 

at all of the history that I think is relevant 

to that question. It has been subsequently 

eroded by any number of additional precedents.

The government's recalibrated 

position, as explained by my friend, is not 

narrow and the Court should not mistake it as 

such. The government's view that a

staggeringly broad.

retained earnings on their books that they've

 invested in corporate assets, research and

 development, and -- and -- and other -- and

 other activities. And in some cases, those 

retained earnings exceed the current value of

 shares.

 Under the government's view and I

 think as demonstrated by the MRT, apparently, 

Congress could simply tax backwards, reaching 

back as far as -- as -- as it would care to do 

so, to attribute those retained earnings going 

back many years to current shareholders, again, 

in some instances in excess of the value of the

But I think the Court should also keep 

in mind that there is an impact to that 

position, that purportedly narrower position, 

under the existing code, which is that there is 

no carveout for -- against taxing shareholders 

in the current code on corporate earnings. 

If those are Sixteenth Amendment

 everything that is income under the Sixteenth

 Amendment.  So there's no carveout.  Those would

 already be subject to it.

 I think this just demonstrates the way 

that the government's position would make a hash

 of existing law and cause enormous confusion 

with respect to how our tax system functions.

 By consequence -- by -- by contrast, I 

-- I don't think that there are any serious 

consequences of this realization principle that 

we've put forward in this case because it is the 

thread that runs through the Court's 

jurisprudence going back over a century and is 

the glue that holds together the Tax Code as it 

exists today. 

Every tax that my friend has mentioned 

falls into one of two categories.  Some of 

those, particularly regarding the -- the abuse 

of the corporate firm -- form, turn on theories 

of constructive realization or you might say 

assignment of income.  I don't think there's 

much of a distinction. 

The remainder of them are

 history of congressional practice. These

 include, for example, the original issue

 discount.  It's simply an excise tax on the

 transaction regarding the transfer of a bond. 

Congress has been levying taxes like that for 

over 130 years at this point.

 Others, like the mark-to-market taxes, 

are excise taxes, like in -- like in Spreckels, 

on conducting business in a specified fashion. 

Again, those sorts of taxes predate the 

Sixteenth Amendment, and nobody has ever called 

into question their constitutionality as such.

 And so far as Macomber's rule is

 concerned -- and the Court has applied the 

dividing line recognized by Macomber as recently

 as 1975 in Ivan Allen and it's carried forward

 the same principle in cases like Indianapolis 

Power & Light in 1990, as well as restating it

spend their time reading Subpart F and practices

complicated and reticulated is because Congress 

has tried to stay within the realization line.

say, well, if you own shares in a foreign

 corporation, whatever the ownership threshold, 

simply pay taxes on those earnings.

 That's not the way the tax -- that

 these sorts of taxing provisions have ever

 worked.  Instead, they get at the idea who is

 really earning the income and -- and -- and

 receiving the benefit by it, and that person

 should be the one to pay taxes on it. We think 

they all fit that mold. 

I'd like to briefly address the 1864 

tax. The Court in Hubbard recognized that it 

was a tax on property.  Subsequently, in 

Brushaber, the Court recognized that at the 

time, that wasn't really considered or thought 

about as being much of a defect with respect to 

the direct tax clauses under sort of the 

reasoning of Springer.  And, of course, Macomber 

rejected the exact same argument. 

We would ask the Court to reverse. 

Thank you.
