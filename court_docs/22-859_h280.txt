CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-859, the 

Securities and Exchange Commission versus

 Jarkesy.

 Mr. Fletcher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Throughout our nation's history, 

Congress has authorized the agencies charged 

with enforcing federal statutes to conduct 

adjudications, find facts, and impose civil 

penalties and other consequences prescribed by 

law. More than a century ago, this Court 

described the validity of those statutes as 

settled beyond any possible constitutional 

question, and since the enactment of the APA, 

those and other administrative adjudications 

have often been conducted by officers specially 

appointed for the purpose and removable only for 

cause. 

This Court should reject all three of

the Fifth Circuit's reasons for upsetting that 

longstanding and entrenched practice.

 First, this Court's decision in Atlas 

Roofing considered many of the same arguments

 presented today and reaffirmed that Congress 

does not violate the Seventh Amendment when it 

authorizes an agency to impose civil penalties

 in administrative proceedings to enforce a

 federal statute.  Respondents have not asked 

this Court to overrule Atlas or the long line of 

precedents on which it rested, and they also 

haven't identified any relevant distinction 

between that case and this one. 

Second, Congress does not violate the 

nondelegation doctrine when it gives an agency 

the choice of pursuing administrative or 

judicial proceedings.  The decision whether and 

how to pursue enforcement action is a 

quintessentially executive power, and Congress 

doesn't violate the Constitution when it leaves 

that decision to executive discretion, as it has 

traditionally done. 

Finally, the APA's limited removal 

protection for ALJs is entirely consistent with 

this Court's decision in Free Enterprise Fund.

There, the Court confronted an unprecedented 

agency, a powerful law enforcement board, that

 was insulated from removal because -- by an

 unusually stringent provision and that was not 

subject to the SEC's control.

 Here, in contrast, ALJs are purely

 adjudicative officers who are subject to the

 Commission's plenary control and review of their 

decisions, and the APA's modest for-cause 

removal standard gives the Commission ample 

authority to remove those ALJs if they fail to 

accept supervision. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But you do agree, Mr. 

Fletcher, that it depends on the type of right 

involved? 

MR. FLETCHER:  We do.  We take this 

Court's statement of the public rights doctrine 

from Atlas Roofing and other cases, and the 

argument we're making here is limited to the 

particular strand of the public rights doctrine 

that the Court has described in Atlas and other 

cases. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And how would you 

define public rights?

MR. FLETCHER:  So I acknowledge, I

 think the Court has acknowledged most recently 

in Oil States, that the public rights concept is 

-- is contested. The Court has never fully

 plumbed its outer perimeters.  I think what I'd 

say is the strand of the doctrine that's

 relevant here is the same one from Atlas, which 

is, when the federal government, an agency, is 

enforcing a federal statute in exercise of its 

sovereign powers, that's a matter involving 

public rights. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  If I don't agree with 

you that we're talking about public rights here, 

that -- that private rights are involved, would 

you then think that it is required that it be 

adjudicated before an -- an Article III court? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So we haven't made an 

argument -- you know, there are some 

circumstances, cases like Schor and Thomas, 

where the Court has said in some circumstances 

it may be permissible to assign initial 

adjudication even involving private rights to 

non-Article III tribunals. 

We're not making an argument like that 

here. We're resting on the argument that this

is a classic public rights case within this 

Court's precedents and also we think properly

 viewed as a matter of first principles.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fletcher,

 could you go directly to Justice Thomas's

 question?  He's already written on this issue, 

and he thinks that a private right is any right

 that involves property, life, or liberty

 basically. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you address 

that part of -- of the Justice's stated views? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I'm happy to. 

Justice Thomas, you have addressed this at 

length in Axon and in other writings.  You know, 

we -- the place where I think we would depart 

from you is we think that the Court's cases 

going back all the way to Murray's Lessee stand 

for the proposition that it can be a matter of 

public rights within -- for purposes of Article 

III even if private property was involved. 

Murray's Lessee, after all, was taking someone's 

property in order to satisfy a debt to the 

government.  Same thing in Stranahan. The same 

thing in Atlas Roofing.

What we think makes it a matter of 

public rights and means that it does not offend 

the separation of powers to assign its

 enforcement and initial adjudication to

 executive branch officials is that it's a

 classic exercise of executive power to enforce 

federal law by applying the law to the facts in 

a particular case and by imposing the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could 

I ask you just a couple of examples and see 

where it falls under your definition? 

The federal government, in association 

with the states, built the interstate highway 

system, an enormous benefit to members of the 

public.  Could the government decide that 

accidents interfere with what they were trying 

to accomplish in the highway system and create 

an agency to hear and adjudicate who's liable, 

responsible, and how much for accidents on the 

highway system?  No court, no jury? 

MR. FLETCHER:  No, Mr. Chief Justice, 

not under the strand of cases that we're relying 

on here. I take the hypothetical to be could 

Congress replace the tort system that would

the sense in which that's relevant and the only

 of healthcare and people take advantage of it, 

and this is a government decision that they want 

that public benefit to be available more

 economically, more efficiently.  Yes, it has 

private rights in it. The people who are 

injured have a right, I guess, to pursue the 

people who injured them. But it's also a public

 right. 

And -- and how are we supposed to 

decide which of those two parameters prevails? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think you can 

acknowledge, as the Court has done before, that 

there are fuzzy boundaries at the outer edges of 

some parts of the public rights doctrine. But I 

think the difference between those cases and 

this one is that in this case, we're talking 

about what we had in Atlas, which is a federal 

agency that's charged with enforcing rights 

enacted for the benefit of the public, in

held by the public, and that --

securities claims regulated by the SEC look a 

lot like claims that could be brought in private 

-- in court before a jury for fraud.

 MR. FLETCHER:  So there's some analogy

 there. There was also some analogy in Atlas 

Roofing, you know, the OSH Act. The claims that 

were brought there looked in some ways like 

negligence or wrongful death claims for 

workplace hazards that had long been brought in 

common law. 

The difference is that there and here, 

Congress has enacted a federal regulatory regime 

that doesn't just federalize securities fraud or 

federalize negligence in workplaces the way some 

of Your Honor's hypotheticals were positing, but 

it erects a comprehensive federal scheme that 

goes well beyond common law fraud, and it 

differs in sort of every particular.  It's --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Let's --

JUSTICE JACKSON: And it's not even 

purporting to be common law fraud.  I mean, I --

I understood that the Seventh -- the -- the 

Seventh Amendment protects private rights of 

action that the common law has created and is 

given to private parties to enforce.

And when you have that situation, when 

you have a common law fraud claim -- that's what

 you're trying to bring -- you have the right 

under the Seventh Amendment to bring that in an 

Article III court with all of the protections 

that exist, including a jury trial.

 But, when Congress has created a new 

right, a new duty, you know, the -- the duty

 that exists under the Securities and Exchange 

Act that -- that is created by law, I thought 

Atlas Roofing was saying you're not worried 

about stealing a common law claim and putting it 

into a non-Article III tribunal, that that's 

really the issue. 

So, when we're looking for, you know, 

this circumstance, we're trying to ask at the 

beginning, is there a common law claim or right 

that is being implicated here? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think that's -- I 

mostly agree with that.  I would supplement it a 

little bit.  I think it's not just the presence 

of a statute that's important.  But, if we're 

talking about a case in court between private 

parties, the Seventh Amendment can apply to a 

case involving legal claims even if they arise

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And -- well, 

let's -- let's come to that in a second. So 

returning to the Chief Justice's questions about 

administrative regimes, I've got another one for 

you. 

Let's say the government revived the 

Sedition Act and decided that, you know, it's 

really important to have a federal agency who 

could bring penalties for defamation against the 

government. 

Jury trial, no jury trial? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Unconstitutional on 

First Amendment grounds for sure.

 First Amendment.  You -- too easy.  We're

 talking about the Seventh Amendment and the

 right to a jury trial, and that -- that is an

 important and ancient right too.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- no jury trial

 of your argument.

 I want to talk to you for just a 

minute about how you deal with Tull and

 Granfinanciera.  We agree that Tull found that

 some civil penalties under the Clean Water Act 

imposed by the government do trigger the Seventh 

Amendment, right? 

MR. FLETCHER:  When heard in court. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  When heard in court. 

And that's the key distinction as far as you're 

concerned? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What if the 

government tomorrow decided, well, we don't like 

those jury trial that come with that, we're --

we're going to -- we're going to effectively 

overrule Tull by moving those to administrative 

proceedings? 

Then the Seventh Amendment would 

disappear on your account, wouldn't it?

Tull is the one in the Seventh Amendment, which 

is a right in suits at common law.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.

 MR. FLETCHER:  If it's an

 administrative proceeding.  It's not a suit at

MR. FLETCHER:  Which was core to

 Granfinanciera's reasoning --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Oh, sure that's --

fine.

 MR. FLETCHER:  -- is what I want to

 say. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Now let's say that 

-- that the government brought a fraudulent 

conveyance argument instead of a private party. 

Then the Seventh Amendment right would again on 

your account, I think, dissipate, disappear, 

whatever verb you want to use? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I'm not as sure 

about that, Justice Gorsuch.  I think the 

principle in Atlas Roofing and the one we're 

relying on here is government enforcement in its 

sovereign capacity. 

If you're talking about government in 

its proprietary capacity bringing a fraudulent 

conveyance claim as an ordinary participant in 

bankruptcy --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, it creates some 

statute much like the one we have here that 

looks a lot like fraud but a little bit 

different in sovereign capacity.

a common law fraud claim and a claim under the

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you just 

break them down? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Sure.  So the critical 

one for purposes of separation of powers is that 

when the Securities and Exchange Commission 

finds facts, conducts adjudications, imposes the 

consequences required by law, it is executing 

the laws in a classic Article II sense.

and impose consequences prescribed by law in

 particular cases.

 So, from the question of asking has 

Congress tried to assign an Article III power to

 some entity that's not an Article III, we think 

it hasn't done that when it's authorized an 

agency to find facts and impose consequences in

 enforcing the law.

 As to specific distinctions on 

securities, so it's not just it's a different 

enforcer, it's also that the requirements look 

different.  Congress didn't just federalize the 

law of fraud.  It adopted a comprehensive 

regulatory regime with lots of prophylactic 

registration, disclosure, and other requirements 

totally unknown to the common law, provided for 

enforcement by the public, not by private 

parties, and provided different remedies, 

including not just things like disgorgement or 

damages but bars on participation in the 

industry, deregistration of securities, civil 

penalties. None of that was found in the common 

law.

 different elements --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  If I

 may finish.

 The remedies were different, but so

 are the -- the elements of the fraud.

 MR. FLETCHER:  The elements are

 different as well, exactly.  Even if you're --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's actually not 

even fraud in all circumstances. 

MR. FLETCHER:  That's the point I was 

trying to make when I said that it's not just 

fraud cases.  It's also prophylactic disclosure 

and other requirements that don't look anything 

like fraud. 

And then, Justice Kagan, I think this 

is where you were going, even if we're talking 

about the subset of SEC cases that do look more 

like common law fraud, the elements are 

different precisely because it's not trying to 

right a private wrong.  We're trying to 

vindicate the public's right to fair and honest 

markets.

 Kokesh, what we're looking for --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the

 statute did require that?  Would your argument

 be different?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So I don't -- parts of 

my argument, I think I wouldn't be able to rely 

on those distinctions. I think my fundamental 

argument would not change because we view the 

critical distinction as -- and the one relevant 

to separation of powers as being that 

enforcement by the executive. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, as to the 

elements of -- of reliance, does it make sense 

to say that the Seventh Amendment provides 

stronger protection when it is easier for the --

the -- the -- the prosecuting party to prove a 

claim than otherwise? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I don't think that's a 

relevant difference for Seventh Amendment

 MR. FLETCHER:  I took the question, 

the thrust of the question, to be are we

 concerned that there's something, some sort of

 circumvention going on.  Has Congress taken 

common law fraud and handed it from the courts

 The -- I think the constitutionally

something that has been assigned to a federal 

agency to enforce --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mr. Fletcher, 

your -- your whole argument on this civil 

penalties point seems to depend on Atlas 

Roofing.  You've mentioned it already probably 

10 times. 

Atlas Roofing, the other side says, 

has been severely undermined by later cases, 

such as Tull and Granfinanciera.  Justice White, 

as you know, suggested parts of Atlas Roofing 

had been overruled in his dissent in the latter 

case.

constitutional perspective to say that a private

suit triggers the Article III right to a federal 

court and a jury, a private suit against you for

 money, but a government suit against you for 

money is somehow exempt from those Article III

 and Seventh Amendment and due process 

requirements simply because the government

 attaches a different label, the public rights

 label to it.

 So I think that's a strong argument on 

the other side.  I wanted you to respond to 

that. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  There were 

several things packed in there.  I'll see if I 

can get to all of them. 

So, first of all, on the notion that 

we're relying solely on Atlas, Atlas obviously 

squarely considered this question, considered a 

lot of the same historical evidence, and 

couldn't have been clearer about what it was 

holding, but I don't want to suggest that that's 

all that we have. 

You know, Atlas itself is relying on a 

line of decisions that go back to Helvering 

versus Mitchell, to the two Elting cases, to 

Stranahan from 1909, and -- and even before

that, all of which stand for the same 

proposition that civil penalties in government 

enforcement actions are permissible, consistent 

with Article III and the Seventh Amendment.

 So, as to the question whether the

 Court has backed away from that, I think exactly

 the opposite is true.  So Tull is about

 government proceedings in court, and it makes 

clear that its holding applies in court and 

doesn't extend to administrative proceedings. 

Granfinanciera and other cases have 

addressed a sort of different and much more 

contested question about when we're dealing with 

liability between two private parties, a 

fraudulent conveyance action there, how -- when 

can Congress take that and assign that to 

non-Article III tribunals. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And what sense 

does it make to say the full constitutional 

protections apply when a private party is suing 

you, but we're going to discard those core 

constitutional historic protections when the 

government comes at you for the same money?

also recognized exactly this issue, sort of

 acknowledged that concern and said the reason is 

that the Article III question is grounded in the

 separation of powers.  We're asking, are we

 concerned about Congress taking away the

 judiciary's power?  And that's not -- that is a

 concern when you have disputes between private

 parties here today.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, what about 

individual liberty?  The purpose of the 

separation of powers is to protect individual 

liberty.  And your individual liberty, it would 

seem, is even more or at least equally affected 

when the government is coming after you than 

another private party. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I agree with that, 

Justice Kavanaugh.  And I think the Due Process 

Clause certainly has something to say here.  In 

cases like Atlas Roofing and more recently in 

Oil States, the Court has emphasized that 

judicial review of agency action may well be 

required. 

I think our point is just that as a 

separation-of-powers matter, as a historical 

matter, it's permissible for Congress to give

be executive power, and that Congress has a lot 

of flexibility in deciding how to provide 

 judicial review. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And isn't that what

 causes --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Fletcher, I have 

a question about Atlas Roofing, and maybe you 

can help me because I'm having a hard time 

figuring out the logic of it. 

So Atlas Roofing says this:  The 

government can commit the enforcement of 

statutes and the imposition of collection -- and 

collection of fines to the judiciary, in which 

case a jury trial would be required.  But the 

United States can also validly opt for 

administrative enforcement without jury trials. 

So I take that to mean that it's 

completely up to the forum, so the right to a 

jury trial would --

MR. FLETCHER:  Right. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- depend on the 

forum --

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.

nature of the action, whether the action is a

 private right or a public right.

 How can that be?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I -- I think

 the answer to that is that the Seventh Amendment

 depends on the forum.  That's the text and

 tradition of the Seventh Amendment.  It's suits

 at common law.  So it never applied in equity. 

We also don't think it applies in administrative 

proceedings. 

But there's an important check on when 

Congress can assign matters to administrative 

proceedings, and that's the public rights/ 

private rights distinction.  That comes from 

Article III. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it seems to me 

that what Atlas Roofing is saying here is that 

the public rights/private rights, just this part 

of it, because it seems to me --

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- that part of your 

argument depends on reading Atlas Roofing for 

all -- all that it's worth.  And I agree Atlas 

Roofing is a good case for you. But it seems to 

me that that part that I read and part of the

premise of Atlas Roofing really doesn't depend 

on the private rights/public rights; it really 

kind of depends on the forum.

 And it's obviously true, right, that

 if you're in front of an agency, you're not

 entitled to a jury trial.  So that's -- that's

 the whole question.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  It --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So it seems to me, 

if you have an entitlement to a jury if you're 

in federal court, I don't understand then how 

you not have that right, how it can go to an 

agency. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So we look at the 

question the way the Court did most recently in 

Oil States, which is consistent with Atlas 

Roofing.  We think the first question is, is 

this a matter that can be assigned to an agency? 

And that's governed by the public rights --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Public rights. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- question under 

Article III, right?  And if the answer to that 

question is yes, then the Seventh Amendment

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Then why would you 

have those rights if it's -- if it -- if the 

government chooses to bring the action in the

 court, why would you have those rights?  Because 

I take it what Atlas Roofing is there -- what

 Atlas Roofing is saying there is that if you 

have the exact same action, and let's assume 

it's public rights, that you could somehow have 

a right to a jury trial if it's in a court. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  And I think the 

difference is, if it's in a court, the Seventh 

Amendment applies by its terms.  If it's in --

permissibly assigned to an administrative 

agency, the Seventh Amendment doesn't apply. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But why?  It doesn't 

apply to everything. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that because the 

Seventh Amendment says suits?  Is that why? 

MR. FLETCHER:  That -- that's part of 

it. I mean, I think that's very strong textual 

evidence.  That's also the longstanding 

historical understanding and the way the Court 

has always approached it.

really interesting question that Justice Barrett 

raises because I think it appeals to this 

intuition, like, we know jury rights are very 

important, and everybody agrees with that. And 

the idea that you would have it in one place and 

not have it in another place, well, why is that?

 But I'm taking you to say that we've 

said that many times over, that the only

 relevant question here is the Article III 

question, that once the Article III question is 

decided in favor of allowing the proceeding to 

go forward in an agency, there is no independent 

Seventh Amendment question. 

And I guess the question is, well, why 

shouldn't there be?  Were we right to have said 

that --

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I think four or 

five times? 

MR. FLETCHER:  At least. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But that's actually 

not quite my question because, in Atlas Roofing, 

it seemed to say -- I mean, I -- I -- I agree

of cases reinforce each other in this respect,

 but then why in Atlas Roofing is it assuming 

that the exact same suit would trigger a right 

to a jury trial in a court but not -- but could

 simultaneously be assigned to an agency? 

Because I take that to be the exact same thing.

 I mean, I take the Court really to 

kind of be saying there if the OSH Act -- if --

if -- if the agency had decided to bring it in a 

court, that it would have been triggered. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And, obviously, it's 

not true that everything that's brought in a 

court triggers the right to a jury trial.  It's 

only those that were suits at common law. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right?  So I -- I --

I guess I just don't understand the logic here 

but for a different reason than Justice Kagan's 

saying at least I -- I think. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I apologize, Justice 

Barrett.  I may -- I may not be completely

answer is no, you don't have a jury trial right.

 Our view is that the text of the 

Seventh Amendment tells you, you don't even ask 

that question if you're in front of a different

 tribunal, like an administrative agency --

the Seventh Amendment is implicated because what 

the Seventh Amendment is doing is protecting the

 right of a person who has a common law fraud 

claim to bring it in federal court and not have 

it directed into some forum where they don't get

 a jury trial. 

So it seems to me that the initial 

question is, what is the right or the duty or

 whatever that is being established?  And so 

Atlas Roofing begins by acknowledging that the 

Act created a new statutory duty, right? So, 

when we have this new statutory duty, it's not a 

common law duty, the question is, can this new 

duty be directed to an administrative tribunal 

without Seventh Amendment protections or not? 

And Atlas Roofing says of course 

because it's a new duty.  It's not -- we're not 

worried that they are stealing the common law 

claims and putting it into this situation.  So, 

for me, the answer is not starting with, where 

is this taking place?  It's starting with, what 

is the claim or the duty at issue? And if it's 

a new statutory duty, says Atlas Roofing, we've 

held forever that Congress can assign it to the 

court, Congress can assign it to the

 MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Barrett --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Briefly,

 counsel.

 MR. FLETCHER:  -- Justice Jackson, I 

think the reason why the Court has looked at it

 differently is that Article III actually 

provides more protection.  It's not just 

concerned about protecting people's access to 

the courts in common law cases where there's a 

right to trial by jury.  It also protects the 

right to go to an Article III court if you have 

an equitable action between two parties. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But what 

about the Seventh Amendment? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Aren't we asking 

what the Seventh Amendment protects? 

MR. FLETCHER:  And -- and the point 

that I'm making is the point from Oil States and 

the Court's other cases, which is the Seventh 

Amendment is essentially downstream from Article 

III. It applies -- it's a forum-dependent right

 something permissibly assigned to an

 administrative agency, you don't have a suit

 assigned at common law.  And so, as the Court 

said at the end of its opinion in Oil States, if 

you've answered the Article III question first

 the Seventh Amendment question too.

a concept that we've had a great deal of trouble

it's also what we said in -- in Stern, that the 

one thing you -- you can't take away from the 

court, you know, suits made of the stuff of the 

traditional actions at common law tried by the 

courts at -- at West -- at Westminster. 

But it can't be the case that it's a

 it's the same thing?

 I mean, that -- suits at common law 

would seem to be a significant constraint on 

what the government can take away from the 

courts and arrogate to its own employees as

 hearing examiners.

 MR. FLETCHER:  So, Mr. Chief Justice,

 I think those constraints exist, but I think the 

Court has located them correctly in Article III 

and the Due Process Clause, not just in the 

Seventh Amendment. 

And I think part of that is because 

those provisions actually provide more 

protection and more access to courts than the 

Seventh Amendment would because the Seventh 

Amendment is limited to suits at common law.

consider what power the government has to take

 away the jury trial right or, as an antecedent 

to that, to take away the right to go into

 court?

 I mean, the government is much more 

likely to affect you and proceed against you

 before one of its own agencies than in court, 

and that concern and that threat is far greater

 today than when Atlas Roofing was set up. 

And -- and as a general matter, it 

does seem to me to be curious that and unlike 

most constitutional rights that you have that 

right until the government decides that they 

don't want you to have it. That doesn't seem to 

me the way the Constitution normally works. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So let me start with 

the first question about changes since Atlas 

Roofing.  I think it's true there are more 

agencies now than there were then.  I don't 

think that changes the relevant constitutional 

principles.  I think the one thing that it does 

highlight is the extent to which Congress has 

relied on Atlas Roofing. 

You know, at that time, Congress said 

-- the Court said these are already very common

 practices.  They have only become more so ever 

since as Congress has relied extensively on this

 Court's holding that this is a permissible way 

to provide for the government to enforce the 

rights held by the public.

 Now I take your point about questions

 of fairness and about the rights of individuals.

 Those are important considerations.  I think

 the -- the only place I would differ from you is 

that we think those are best answered by the Due 

Process Clause, which speaks to the requirement 

of judicial review and by the provision of 

judicial review of the agency's actions at the 

back end. 

And, finally, you asked about the sort 

of question about the forum and isn't it a 

little odd to think of a constitutional right 

that applies in some places and not in others. 

And the point that I was trying to get 

at in response to Justice Barrett earlier is 

that that's always been a feature of the Seventh 

Amendment.  At the founding, you could have had 

exactly the same sort of --

in one place or another.

 My point was more it could be in one

 place we have the protections of Article III 

against the government, or the government can 

decide we think we'll be better off deciding 

that in our own agency before our own employees.

 That's not just one place or another. 

It seems to me that undermines the whole point

 of the constitutional protection in the first 

place. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I disagree, Mr. 

Chief Justice.  I think that's something that 

Congress has long done, has provided for 

administrative adjudications first and judicial 

review later. 

I think that's obviously subject to 

due process constraints, but when it is 

consistent with those constraints, and there's 

no challenge here that this scheme is not, then 

it is consistent with our tradition and -- and 

not just since Atlas Roofing, but, really, you 

know, this was an established practice for more 

than a century before that as well.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Fletcher, would 

you give us a brief definition, your definition

 of public rights?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Sure.  I think the --

I'm not going to try to do it comprehensively 

because I think that there are some sort of 

contested questions that are not at issue in

 this case.

 For purposes of this case, we would 

just ask the Court to say what it said in Atlas 

Roofing, which is, when the government in its 

sovereign capacity is enforcing a federal 

statute, then it is enforcing public rights. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So it's the nature of 

the government's enforcement? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  It is -- it is. 

I think I would put it maybe the way Justice 

Scalia did in Gran -- his Granfinanciera 

concurrence where he said it's are we enforcing 

rights held by the public.  That's the meaning 

of public rights. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So how would you --

how would property rights fit in that?  Those 

are usually considered private.

 understand the intuition that you have written

 about and that some scholarship has written

 about that says the -- the public rights/private

 rights question should be are there private 

rights like property or liberty at stake on one 

side of the ledger.

 And the reason why I think that can't 

be the way to ask the question is that in all of 

-- many of the Court's public rights cases going 

back to Murray's Lessee, there have been private 

property interests that would be affected. 

There are administrative adjudications 

that happen all the time that affect property, 

that affect liberty in the immigration context, 

that affect very important interests of 

individuals that we still conceive of as public 

rights matters that can go to agencies in the 

first instance.

the Seventh Amendment doesn't apply here because 

it's not a suit.

 Why is it not a suit?

 MR. FLETCHER:  I think because a suit 

is traditionally understood to be a proceeding

 in court.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if something -- if

 a -- a claim at common law for which a party 

would have the right to a jury trial is simply 

transferred to some other tribunal, that makes 

it not a suit? 

MR. FLETCHER:  When it's assigned to 

executive officers to find the facts and apply 

the law, that's not a suit.  And that's 

something that's been happening since the 

founding, often very informally, and I think our 

point here is that Congress can provide 

trial-type procedures to make sure that that's 

more fair to parties and more accurate, but when 

it does that, it doesn't change the nature of 

the power.

like a pretty patent evasion of the Seventh

 Amendment to say this protection which was 

regarded at the time of the adoption of the Bill

 of Rights as sufficiently important to merit

 inclusion in the Constitution can be nullified 

simply by changing the label that is attached to

 a tribunal?

 MR. FLETCHER:  And the difference, 

Justice Alito, is that I don't think it's just 

changing the label. It is changing the nature 

of the power being exercised. 

And I want to underscore again that I 

think it very well may be the case that there 

are constitutional rights that require some 

amount of judicial process.  Our point is just 

that we think those are found in the Due Process 

Clause and not in the Seventh Amendment. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the -- what if 

the -- the suit is not the -- the -- the 

adjudication, the -- the dispute is not between 

the government and a private party but between 

two private parties, but it's before an agency.

not a suit, but Article III would have much more 

to say about that, and it there imposes much 

greater constraints on Congress's ability to

 assign that sort of dispute between private 

parties to an agency in the first place.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I don't 

understand why you keep shifting to Article III. 

I mean, the question before us is the Seventh 

Amendment, which speaks directly to the question 

of suits at common law and to a private right 

and to the right of a jury trial.  Or I'll --

I'll take out the private right part. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It speaks to suits at 

common law and -- and the right to a jury trial. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  So the reason 

I'm focused on Article III is that because the 

first answer to the Seventh Amendment is it's 

suits at common law.  Proceedings in an agency 

aren't suits. 

I take the force of your response, 

which is it seems odd to say that we can just 

take something away from a court and hand it to

 important one.  It's Article III and the Due 

Process Clause, just not the setting.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  Well, Article 

III was in the Constitution in 1787, but when 

Congress and the states put the Seventh

 Amendment into the Constitution, they apparently 

thought that Article III wasn't going to provide

 sufficient protection.

 Can we not infer that? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I think you 

absolutely can.  But we think you should 

continue to, as you have before, read the 

Seventh Amendment's protection by its terms, 

which is to be focused on suits in court, suits 

at common law. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  The -- the 

other question was one that Justice Kavanaugh 

asked, and I want you to go back to it. 

And -- and I want to -- I want you to 

talk about the theory behind the Seventh 

Amendment.  You have -- you have arguments based 

on precedent.  You have your -- your textual 

argument about suit.  But I just want you to 

talk about the theory of the Seventh Amendment.

have protection against having their liberty or 

property taken away by officials who are

 answerable to a powerful executive, that the 

jury should be set up as a buffer between what

 the -- in that situation?

 Isn't that the theory of it? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I don't think,

 respectfully, Justice Alito, that's the primary 

theory behind the Seventh Amendment.  That's --

that's part of it sometimes. 

But, as we explained, you know, the --

the proponents of the Seventh Amendment 

identified a lot of concerns about checking 

judges, about providing protection in private 

suits, and, really, I think the most telling 

evidence that it wasn't concerned about 

government enforcement is that in five of the 

seven state ratifying conventions that proposed 

something like the Seventh Amendment, they 

limited it to suits between private parties or 

involving real property.  So they would have 

excluded the government altogether.

of the United States.  Justice Kavanaugh's 

question was what sense does it make to say you

 have this protection when you're being sued by a 

private party, whose resources are certainly 

going to be more limited than the resources of 

the federal government, but when the same thing 

happens to you and the party that's against you 

is the federal government, well, this right to a 

jury trial simply goes out the window. 

Does that make sense? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I think it does 

because I don't think it's the same thing that 

happens.  If it's truly the same thing, if the 

government is proceeding against you in court on 

the same basis as a private party, then that's 

Tull, and the jury trial right does attach. 

But what is different about an 

administrative proceeding is that then we're in 

the world of Congress permissibly, in a way that 

it is permitted to do under the Constitution, 

assigning to executive officials the 

responsibility for finding facts and imposing 

consequences, which happens all the time every 

day. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Thank you.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go back to

 that distinction you were drawing earlier.  You 

said that Justice Thomas and I think Justice

 Alito are concentrating on the Respondents'

 interests.  But I think that we haven't really

 concentrated on what -- how the difference 

between a private right and a public right 

exist. I understood a public right to be a 

right possessed by the sovereign. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it's an 

interest that's not -- that's possessed by the 

sovereign, correct? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly, yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's why 

that interest in this case is to protect the --

MR. FLETCHER: Integrity of the 

securities markets, yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that would 

include actions that have nothing to do with 

fraud, like a failure to disclose, registration 

requirements, et cetera, et cetera.  If you 

violate those, you pay a penalty for it.

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly right.  And I

 think that also points up why it would be very 

difficult if the Court were to try to go down my 

friend's road and to say that the Seventh 

Amendment or Article III depended on how closely

 analogous the agency's enforcement action was to 

some suit at common law or to common law fraud. 

I think that would require having to parse on

 almost a provision-by-provision of the 

securities or other laws or even on a 

case-by-case basis, and there's no real 

principled yardstick for asking how analogous is 

too analogous for those purposes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I mean, 

there's -- and you're absolutely right, from 

Murray's Lease down to our INA case to 

everything else, we've permitted the public 

interest to be protected in an administrative 

proceeding, correct? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Correct.  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now I'm going to 

pose what I consider the hardest question.  I 

see the remedies here as remedies that are not 

generally available in common law, whether it's 

being barred or -- from practice or from -- or

 other things like that.

 Penalties seem similar, but how about

 if it included restitution, meaning now we're 

going to pay the money to a private party?

 Would that pose a problem?

 MR. FLETCHER:  I don't think it would. 

You know, first of all, in this case, there's a 

disgorgement remedy, and the SEC -- the money 

goes to the SEC in the first instance, but then 

the SEC has to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and I think 

disgorgement is always very different because 

that's more like a fine or -- or --

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So our view is 

that even if part of the remedy that the 

government is securing for the public, for the 

sovereign in the name of vindicating the public 

interest then is later paid over to private 

parties, that's still a matter of public rights. 

And that's not new here.  The two 

Elting cases from 1932 that we describe, the 

penalties were not just a civil monetary penalty 

enforced by administrative officials.  Those 

were immigration cases about unlawfully bringing 

non-citizens to the country.  And administrative

 And I think some of the questions that

Atlas Roofing. 

So go backwards for me.  Go forwards 

for me. 

MR. FLETCHER:  And so let me start 

with backwards and then forwards. 

Going backwards, Atlas Roofing 

grounded its decision in a long line of prior 

cases. I think the best one to look at if you 

were just going to pick one is Oceanic Steam 

Navigation versus Stranahan.  It's an 

immigration case from 1909.  Many of the same 

arguments are presented.  A party was subject to 

a fine by administrative officials, and they

got to go to an Article III court with all of

 the protections that that entails.  And the 

Court said in the line that I quoted in my 

introduction the understanding from the

 beginning has been that Congress can legislate, 

impose civil penalties, and have executive

 officials impose those penalties in the first

 instance.

 That same thing is reflected in 

Passavant, which is a case from the -- 1893, in 

the Elting cases from 1932, in Helvering versus 

Mitchell, and those aren't just, you know, 

pinpoints in the landscape.  All of them are 

saying this is a thing that Congress has long 

done. It is a thing that commonly happens.  So 

it's not just precedent.  I think it's also 

practice of the government that this Court has 

often looked to as being very important in the 

separation of powers. 

So, going forward both to what the 

Court has done so far and what some of the 

questions suggest that the Court might do, I 

don't think there's any way to read the Court's 

subsequent cases as retreating from Atlas 

Roofing.  All of them that my friend relies on

the public rights doctrine when you're talking

 about the liability between two private parties. 

That's Granfinanciera, Thomas, Schor, Stern

 versus Marshall.  All of them are careful to

 carve out and say we're talking about this

 special zone of liability between two private

 parties --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Indeed, if I might 

just interrupt, I mean, when you started in your 

introduction and you said what the Court has 

often said, that this is a very complicated, 

difficult area, but the Court has often said 

that when it's faced cases involving two private 

parties in which their dispute is embedded in a 

federal statutory scheme, and those are the 

cases that we found complicated and difficult. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly, and you have 

Justice Scalia, you know, in Granfinanciera 

saying I would limit the public rights doctrine 

to cases involving the government because he 

disagrees with where the Court had gone on cases 

involving private parties.  But this piece, the 

strand that I'm relying on here, is really a

 questioned.

 And when -- I think one of the

 questions suggested Justice White, who was in 

dissent in Granfinanciera, said the Court has

 overruled Atlas Roofing, that was because he 

read Atlas Roofing to speak to the private 

parties cases, which we don't think it did, and

 the Court didn't agree.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  He read Atlas Roofing 

to impose a ceiling, which the Court had said, 

no, it doesn't where also -- there are also 

public rights involved in some private/private 

cases. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  Exactly.  And 

-- and so then, if I could, let me just -- you 

asked about going forward and some of the 

questions that have been raised about first 

principles.  We don't think for the reasons that 

I described that there's anything wrong with 

Atlas Roofing as a matter of first principles. 

You know, quite to the contrary, we think this 

is a separation-of-powers matter, and this 

strand of the public rights doctrine is a 

reflection of it being a core exercise of 

executive power sometimes to adjudicate matters

 consequences.  It's immigration, it's seizing 

goods, it's taxes, it's customs all throughout

 our history.  It happens all the time.

 And -- and I think the concern that I 

have about trying to reexamine all of that at 

this late date is really the consequences it

 would have both jurisprudentially and

 practically.  So, as a jurisprudential matter, 

you know, some of the scholarship that Justice 

Thomas has relied on in his very thoughtful 

separate writings on this question very much 

acknowledged that they are saying that 

administrative law has taken a wrong turn a 

hundred years ago and needs to be fundamentally 

re-imagined. 

I think that's a heavy task for the 

Court to take on, and I think, if you -- the --

you were inclined to do it, you certainly 

shouldn't do it in a case like this one, where I 

don't understand my friends to have asked you to 

overrule even Atlas, much less all of the other 

cases, much less tried to make the showing that 

really grapples with all of the consequences.

Justice made the point that it's been 50 years

 and things have changed and that administrative 

agencies are more powerful, well, so too in 

those a hundred years, I mean, our problems have 

only gotten more complicated and difficult.

 And it's usually Congress that decides 

how to solve those problems and whether 

administrative agencies with the kind of 

expertise that they have are the appropriate way 

to solve those problems, not this Court, which 

decides, oh, well, we really only need common 

law suits to deal with securities regulation. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly, Justice Kagan. 

And I think the growth of civil penalties in 

administrative proceedings in particular, a lot 

of that is traceable to a report from the 

Administrative Conference of the United States 

in the 1970s that said this is a practice that 

is, you know, on sound constitutional footing. 

Some agencies have long had it, but we think 

there would be real salutary benefits both to 

the regulated parties and to the agencies of 

giving them the authority to do this because it 

can be done more efficiently in administrative 

proceedings because often administrative

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So, Mr. Fletcher, 

with respect to your argument that Congress can 

move something from courts into agencies and the 

Seventh Amendment doesn't speak to that because 

it's not a suit, I think Noel Webster described 

a suit as any action or process for the recovery 

of a right or a claim before any tribunal, which 

would seem to be a problem.  That's a pretty 

contemporaneous definition. 

And then Justice Brennan in 

Granfinanciera I think addressed your argument 

pretty squarely when he said "Congress cannot 

eliminate a party's Seventh Amendment right to a 

jury trial merely by relabeling the cause of

subsequent cases, including Oil States, have 

said, if you're permissibly in an Article III 

tribunal, then the Seventh Amendment doesn't

 have independent work to do.

 I apologize for misidentifying the 

case I was relying on.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  But

 it -- it would seem strange. And we don't 

usually say the -- the government can avoid a 

constitutional mandate merely by relabeling or 

moving things around.  It's -- it's as much a 

violation to do something indirectly as it is 

directly we usually say, right? 

MR. FLETCHER:  In some cases, but, 

again, the Seventh Amendment has always been 

forum-dependent. And, Justice Gorsuch, I just 

think it would also be odd to say, if executive 

officials impose penalties or other consequences 

very informally in ways that don't look at all 

like a tribunal because it's just the Customs 

officer saying you owe this much duties, then 

that's --

 Kagan were talking about, this SE -- this is not 

your grandfather's SEC, right?

 Penalties were not something that were 

part of Jim Landis's original design against 

private parties, let alone against all private

 persons, right? 

MR. FLETCHER:  That's right.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That came in the 19

trading claims, and then it was expanded, and 

what is at issue before us is a 2010 amendment

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So we're not talking 

about a huge number of cases. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Again, for the SEC, 

yes. For the administrative -- the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Most -- most of the 

ALJs in -- work for places like the Social 

Security Administration, right, which give 

benefits and we're not talking about penalties.

them are at SSA.

then, with respect to history, your best 

examples I think are on page 23 of your brief.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Twenty-two to 23, yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The Customs, right?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Tax and immigration?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Those are the

 three areas you'd have us point to.  Any others? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I mean, Atlas Roofing 

as well. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Obviously. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right.  Couldn't leave 

it out.  But, you know, I think also the 

reasoning of those cases is not tied to those 

particular exercises of power, and, in fact, to 

the contrary, in Stranahan, the challenger in 

that case said this is a power that only exists 

in tax and customs cases.  It shouldn't extend 

here. And the Court rejected that and said it's 

not that limited, it applies here too. 

And then, in Atlas Roofing, the 

challenger said it's just customs and tax and 

immigration, and again the Court said it's not 

so limited.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Then, with

 respect to Tull and Granfinanciera and their 

impact, Justice White, for whom I have great

 fondness, thought that they were overruled,

 didn't he?

 MR. FLETCHER:  He did in part, but 

that was based on a different understanding of 

-- of the Atlas Roofing decision than the one

 the majority had. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then you 

referenced Justice Scalia and his -- his belief 

that there had to be the government involved in 

the case to render it a public right.  He made 

clear he thought that was a minimum. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right?  That was not 

the test writ large, correct? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. And it's not our 

test writ large either. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then we all 

agree Congress has a lot more problems on its 

plate today than it -- than it did a hundred 

years ago or even 50 years ago.  But that 

doesn't mean that the constraints of the 

Constitution somehow evaporate, do they?

public rights extended, quoting Northern

between individuals and the government in 

connection with the performance of the 

constitutional functions of the executive or 

legislative departments that historically could 

have been determined exclusively by those

the Due Process Clause between benefits and

 penalties.

 And I want you to respond.  Is that

 incorrect, that statement, or is -- what --

what's -- what's the -- your response to that

 line from Stern v. Marshall?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So the -- the

 Court has said that a couple times.  I want to 

say what I think it means, and then I hope to 

say why I think, if you read it the other way, 

as you're suggesting, that might have some 

really troubling implications. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Sure.  Go ahead. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So, on what I think it 

means, I think the Court is talking about 

matters that could be determined exclusively by 

the other branches insofar as Article III is 

concerned. I don't take it to be saying things 

that you could assign to the executive branch 

and foreclose all judicial review altogether. 

I think that's true of a lot of the 

things that we think of as being classic public 

rights-type cases. And I think the reason why I 

would warn you away from reading it differently

is that if you read it that way, as -- as some 

of the scholarship has done, then I think

 Congress really and this Court has only two

 choices.

 Option one is Congress can assign 

something to the initial adjudication by an 

administrator, but if that can happen, then the 

implication is it can also bar judicial review

 altogether. 

And option two is it has to go to an 

Article III court in the first instance, and 

that would be a sea change for all sorts of 

things that are not benefits, but I'm talking 

about, you know, the assessment and collection 

of taxes and penalties, customs and penalties, 

the immigration laws, the detention and removal 

of non-citizens. All of those things are things 

that are done in the first instance and have 

long been done in the first instance by 

administrative officers. 

And if you adopt the rule that it's 

only things that we can say can be done 

exclusively by the administrative officers 

without any judicial review at all, then I think 

you're in a really untenable choice in those

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  But the 

flip side, I guess -- and you've said this --

you know, this started with Atlas Roofing -- you

 know, I know you have your cases it relies on,

 1972 ACUS report that you properly mentioned, 

and it seemed like a small matter then 

potentially, but, as others have pointed out, it 

expands to other agencies. 

And I think the logic of your position 

is that you could go all the way in the other 

direction from what you were just saying and the 

Congress could assign all federal government 

civil penalty suits to be housed at in-house 

executive agencies. 

Is that your position? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Potentially, yes, you 

know, again, if it fits all the criteria. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What's the 

potentially? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I -- I think the 

questions that you'd want to ask are, you know,

 to have -- federalize, you know, tort law or

 something like that. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Right?  Also, there are 

constraints on what can be done through civil 

means rather than criminal means in terms of the 

severity of the sanctions that can be imposed.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But assuming those 

things away, yes, the logic of your position is 

that --

MR. FLETCHER: Yeah.  Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- that -- well, 

and on the Due Process Clause, because you've 

said let's talk not about the Seventh Amendment 

but the Due Process Clause --

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- that seems 

problematic to say the government can deprive 

you of your property, your money, substantial 

sums, in a tribunal that is at least perceived 

as not being impartial in the sense that it's an 

in-house executive agency where the 

commissioners start the enforcement process, 

oversee the enforcers, and then appoint the --

 unappealing dichotomy that the sort of really

 strict understanding of trying to locate this 

rule in Article III and saying only if it could 

be exclusively assigned to an administrative 

agency with no judicial review at all can it 

ever be assigned to them on the one hand or

 everything's got to go to the district court in 

the first instance, you know, I think that's

 untenable as a practical matter. It's 

overturning a huge swath of law. 

I think, if you have concerns about 

that -- and, again, this wouldn't be the case to 

explore them -- but, if you did, I think the Due 

Process Clause is a better tool because it 

provides the ability to draw finer distinctions 

than the sort of blunderbuss ones that I think 

you would be forced into if you adopted the 

public rights Article III inquiry as the 

solution to -- to any problem you perceive 

there. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One of the 

oddities of this statutory scheme is that the 

SEC is authorized to and, in fact, does bring 

suits in federal court.  Why?

the chronology really. You know, the suits in 

federal court, by and large, came first in terms 

of when penalties could be sought, and Congress

 later came along and added them to the

 administrative proceedings as well.  You know, I

 think that's different.  Congress is making

 judgments at different times.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But why would the

 SEC bring suits in federal court? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I'm -- I'm sorry, I 

thought you were talking about the --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No, I -- I was. 

You answered the correct question, but a 

follow-on question is, why would -- would the 

SEC bring suits in federal court? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So it makes that 

judgment on a case-by-case basis depending on 

the case.  And it might depend on what remedies 

are available in the two forums. You know, 

here, penalties are available in both, but there 

are certain other remedies that differ, and they 

might make a judgment about that. 

They might also make a judgment about 

which one is likely to be faster under the 

circumstances of the case.  There are some

 circumstances where -- especially where they've 

settled a case or where it's a sort of follow-on 

proceeding that's going to be very simple that 

they choose to file those administratively

 rather than burdening the courts with those.

 And there are other circumstances

 where they have a very technical regulatory

 issue that they're looking to achieve consistent 

treatment across a bunch of cases, and they 

conclude that that can more easily be done 

administratively than in court. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But, in terms of 

the repercussions if we went down the civil 

penalty line, for the SEC at least, they could 

bring all -- all the civil penalty suits in 

federal court.  If benefits were the other side 

of the line, that excludes Social Security and 

those kinds of agencies.  Why don't you talk 

about, because I think you were talking about 

this with Justice Gorsuch, the ramifications if 

the line were civil penalty in terms of other 

agencies? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So I -- I think 

they are large.  You know, already in Atlas 

Roofing, the Court said that these are common.

question.  And I understand there are some times

answers it.  And I just think this is exactly

 And, here, none of those things are

Okay. So this is public rights, not

show as much.  You don't have to show damages. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Principally, our view 

is it's public rights, not private rights, 

because it's enforcement by the government of 

rights that are held in the public to vindicate 

a public interest in the securities markets.

We think also, in addition, there's no

 concern that Congress is circumventing the laws 

of fraud by just replicating or federalizing the 

common law fraud because the elements are very

 different.  But that's not the principal

 distinction we're relying on.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Not the principal

 distinction.  Okay.  If the SEC pursued Jarkesy 

in federal district court, he's entitled to a 

jury? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And that's because 

it's a suit because the judge is the 

fact-finder? 

MR. FLETCHER:  That's because it's a

brought in front of the ALJ, exact same

because the ALJ and the agency is the one

 finding the facts?

 MR. FLETCHER:  It -- exactly.  It 

looks like a trial.  It has trial-type 

procedures, but that's an exercise of executive 

power. The jury trial right has always been 

thought of as an adjunct to the exercises of the 

judicial power in the courts.  And the lesson 

from all of this Court's cases -- City of 

Arlington, Murray's Lessee -- is that even when 

the executive branch conducts an adjudication 

and applies the law to the facts, even if it 

looks like trial-type procedures to enhance 

fairness, that's not the sort of suit that 

requires an exercise of the judicial power or

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And then I

 just want to clarify, Justice Kavanaugh asked 

you what's the limiting principle because 

Congress always, we hope, is acting in the

 public interest.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So what is the limit 

on Congress's ability to shift these kind of

 adjudications for civil penalties to 

administrative agencies? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.  So, again, it 

has to be a federal regulatory scheme.  It has 

to be enforced by the government.  That's the 

critical public rights distinction.  We're not 

displacing the courts from adjudicating disputes 

between private parties and raising that set of 

separation-of-powers concerns. 

In -- in addition, I think you could 

say we don't have any concerns about just 

federalizing the law of fraud or something like 

that. This is very different.  It's a 

comprehensive regulatory scheme like the one the 

Court had in the OSH Act.  And then, in 

addition, you have the sort of constraints on 

when Congress can assign something to an

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But just to 

interrupt for one second, but, you know, we are

 talking here about securities law, but Congress 

can enact such a scheme and has enacted such 

schemes in many, many, many different areas. 

The Chief Justice began by pointing some of

 those out. So, in all of these areas, 

healthcare, highway management, what have you --

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly.  And --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- it could happen. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- so I -- I 

acknowledge that the rule that I'm giving you is 

broad. That's in part because Congress has done 

this in many, many different circumstances.  We 

think validly so.  But the breadth of the rule 

is consistent with our historical practice and 

with this Court's decisions, you know, not just 

Atlas but before that too. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So we've 

talked some about fallout.  So, here, what the 

SEC got from Jarkesy in disgorgement was more 

than civil penalties.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.  And the SEC

 also got other kinds of injunctive relief.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Correct.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.  So why isn't 

-- why do you need civil penalties?  Because,

 you know, Jarkesy's not disputing that you can

 get those kinds of things in administrative

 proceedings.  So why civil penalties too?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So can I just quibble 

with the premise?  Because this is one of the 

things that concerns us about this case. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MR. FLETCHER:  He is focused on civil 

penalties, but disgorgement also affects the 

private right to property.  And so some of his 

arguments, I think the implication of them is 

those things also couldn't happen in 

administrative proceedings.  I'm a little 

unclear about that because the argument moves 

back and forth from Article III to the Seventh 

Amendment, but I think the potential 

implications of cutting back on the Atlas 

Roofing understanding of public rights doesn't 

just apply to penalties.  It's also cases 

involving disgorgement or other such remedies.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Even if they were 

considered traditionally equitable remedies?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So, again, if -- if you 

-- there's a couple ways that you could depart 

from Atlas Roofing. One would be to say we're 

decoupling the Seventh Amendment from the 

Article III inquiry, and we're going to

 recognize a new class of suits where Article III

 would let you give it to an agency, but the 

Seventh Amendment still requires a trial by 

jury. There, I think such a rule might be 

limited to civil penalties because the other 

remedies are equitable. 

But, if you go in the other direction, 

which some of my friends have suggested and some 

of the questions have suggested, and say anytime 

you have an administrative action that affects 

private property or liberty or anything else, 

that's public rights, that means that under 

Article III it can't go to the agency to begin 

with.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I agree that

 Atlas Roofing resolves this case, but like many 

of my colleagues, I guess I don't understand

 your reading of Atlas Roofing as suggesting 

there's no Seventh Amendment issue at all if the

 fact-finding function is assigned to the agency.

 I mean, the case begins, sentence one,

 the issue in this case -- in -- in these cases 

is whether, consistent with the Seventh 

Amendment, Congress may create a new cause of 

action in the government for civil penalties 

enforceable in an administrative agency where 

there is no jury trial. 

You seem to say, well, it depends on 

whether Congress has assigned resolution of this 

to the agency.  But that seems totally 

conclusory and circular to me. And I think the 

question is, when does the Seventh Amendment 

prohibit Congress from assigning it to the 

agency as opposed to giving it to an Article III 

court? 

You say that's forum-dependent, but --

but the -- the question is, when can they give 

it to one forum versus the other?  And in my 

view, the Seventh Amendment and what Atlas

Roofing is saying is that it's -- it's

 claim-dependent. It's the part of your argument 

where you talk about is this a situation in 

which Congress is taking a common law duty, 

right, action, or whatever and moving it into

 the administrative process?

 And so the Seventh Amendment says you 

can't do that. If a person has a common law 

right of fraud, right, the common law creates 

duties like the duty not to make a 

representation that people rely on to their 

detriment.  And it's established a right of 

action in private parties to enforce that duty. 

They can come to court. 

And the Seventh Circuit -- the Seventh 

Amendment says, when you have such a right to 

enforce that duty, you are -- by the 

Constitution, you have -- you -- you have the 

ability to come to court.  The government can't 

make you go to some administrative tribunal and 

have no jury.  All right? 

But there are also other duties in the 

world. Those duties can be created by statute,

 MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Jackson, that's

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MR. FLETCHER:  -- that's enforced in

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand,

that. It says Congress can choose to allow you 

to enforce or allow the government to enforce 

this new duty in court versus the administrative 

proceeding, and when it chooses court, then you 

have the Seventh Amendment right. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, if it chooses

it is enforcing a statutory duty.  The Seventh

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  That's fine.  But

 Atlas -- I couldn't find Article III in Atlas

 Roofing.  It's not talking about that aspect of 

the analysis. It's, I thought, talking about

 when Congress at the beginning creates a new 

statutory duty, and in this case, it's the duty 

not to, what, employ any device, scheme, or 

artifice to defraud in the context of securities 

transactions. 

There's a new statute, you've got this 

new duty, Congress says there it is, and we're 

giving it to the government to enforce this for 

the benefit of the public.  All right?  That's 

the beginning. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  In that situation,

 foundation.

 For the Seventh Amendment, that

 foundation was set in 1791.  The founders 

thought that they had enshrined this right for

 government claims against citizens' property 

rights, still stinging from the Stamp Act and

 the abuses of the vice admiralty courts.

 My friend's really radical position is

 antithetical, totally antithetical, to the 

founders' intent.  The jury trial right should 

apply especially when the government is coming 

after a citizen for penalties on a common law 

claim. 

The SEC's position really fares no 

better under the public rights doctrine.  The 

basic claims -- these basic fraud claims are 

litigated privately among private parties every 

day, same claims, same statutes, and they've 

been litigated -- the same basic claims have 

been litigated for centuries. 

These underlying claims do not 

suddenly morph into public rights claims just 

because the government happens to stand in as 

the -- as the proxy plaintiff.

 overrule Atlas Roofing.  Atlas Roofing actually,

 as modified by subsequent decisions, provides a

 useful template for analyzing at least the 

public/private rights analysis and leads to the 

same conclusion that Mr. Jarkesy was entitled to

 other ways that it -- that it's been pronounced

The -- the bottom line is these claims

suited, for summary agency adjudication when the 

SEC's been trying these same claims in real 

federal -- Article III federal courts for 

decades.  It doesn't make any sense. 

And even if they could, the Article I 

assignment was not -- was not the SEC's to make. 

It's a quintessential legislative power, as this 

Court has -- has held, and it doesn't convert 

into executive power just because it's exercised 

by the executive, which is essentially their 

argument.

v. Bernhard, where the Court held that a

 shareholder derivative action against directors 

and third parties under one of the securities

 acts, the Investment Company Act, which

 prevented larceny, embezzlement, 

misrepresentations, the same exact claims that 

are alleged in this -- in this case here against 

Mr. Jarkesy, back then, under the common law, a 

shareholder derivative action had to be in a 

court of equity.  So you don't get a jury in a 

court of equity.  We'll get to the -- the -- the 

forum impact later.  We'll address that in a few 

minutes. 

But the Court held that because the 

real plaintiff in a shareholder derivative 

action is the corporation, the corporation, if 

it took these claims to court, it was I think 

against Lehman Brothers for fraud, if they took 

these claims to court, then the corporation 

would be entitled to a jury. 

And so, therefore, because the 

underlying claim belongs to the corporation, the 

underlying claim is a private one.  The

-- the Court juxtaposes that. You look at the

 nature of the claim versus the elements of these

 OSHA claims.

 Now the OSHA -- and this gets really 

right to the heart of what the problem here is. 

OSHA created a number of brand -- brand new --

the Court used the word "new," I think, 11 times

 in that decision -- used that to describe these 

-- these regular -- very -- a lot of minutiae, 

very precise regulatory requirements, such as 

what Atlas Roofing got penalized for, I think, 

$600 for improper placement of a roof or a 

ceiling cover. 

So these were not claims that ever 

existed at common law. And those claims --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. McColloch --

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- if I could 

interrupt you for a second.  I mean, I have to 

say you're sort of describing a case that I 

don't recognize.  Atlas Roofing says numerous 

times, it could not have been clearer, the 

Seventh Amendment is no bar to the creation of 

new rights or to their enforcement outside the 

regular courts of law. That's one statement.

Congress is not required by the 

Seventh Amendment to choke the already crowded

 federal courts with new types of litigation or 

prevent it from committing some new types of

 litigation to administrative agencies with

 special confidence.  That's another.

 There's another.  There's another. 

There's another. I agree with you it says "new

 claims."  We can talk about what "new claims" 

is. But it could not have been clearer that --

that what they were saying is that the Seventh 

Amendment was no bar to Congress making a 

decision that certain kinds of claims were best 

adjudicated in administrative agencies. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yes, Your Honor, and 

-- and I think we're -- we're pretty close 

actually.  So maybe the -- the -- the dispute is 

over what "new" is. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If we're pretty close, 

because I think that just resolves the case.

I mean, it -- it didn't -- the holding was not

 dependent on this necessarily, but -- but OSH

 Act says, look, there were ways to proceed

 against these kinds of employers in federal

 court. You could bring a negligence suit.  You

 could bring a wrongful death suit.  But, the 

Court says, Congress thought that wasn't enough. 

Congress thought you shouldn't have to wait

 until the injury happens.  And so Congress gave 

power to OSHA under the OSH Act in order to 

bring claims for all kinds of workplace safety 

issues before a death took place, before an 

injury occurred. 

And that's exactly what the securities 

laws do.  It says we don't need an injury.  We 

don't need reliance.  We're constructing a 

prophylactic scheme, and we're constructing it 

because we understand that the securities 

markets need to be honest and fair and people 

need to be able to rely on them. And so it 

takes a common law suit and says we're going to 

throw out some of these elements and we're going 

to create a prophylactic way to make the 

securities markets fair and put it in an 

administrative agency.  Exactly what OSH Act

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Correct.  And those --

we have -- we have no problem with those being 

declared public rights, those being tried in 

administrative forums where -- where -- without

prophylactic claims were never recognized in the 

courts of England in the late 18th Century. 

So what -- what the Court in Atlas 

Roofing did, after contrasting from Ross v. 

Bernhard what a true private claim is, what a 

private rights claim is, the Court in Atlas 

Roofing said we'll leave these -- this -- this 

traditional litigation aside, we're going to 

create the prophylactics, the prophylactics can

the Seventh Amendment would say you have to do

 that in the -- you know, a regular court. But, 

instead, what they said is we're going to do the 

cause of action that exists under the federal 

statute that creates this new right, and per 

Atlas Roofing, the Court says there's no Seventh

 Amendment barrier to them bringing that claim in 

an administrative agency rather than the court.

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  And what this Court 

has held repeatedly is that that is not a new 

right. If you -- and -- and I come back to 

Granfinanciera, probably the -- the best 

explanation of this.  This Court rejected the 

taxonomic change, taking a common law right,

going to say, but Justice Jackson's asking an

 important question here because we pointed out 

in our discussions with Mr. Fletcher that our 

cases have not been very clear about how to 

distinguish public from private rights.

 And if I understand you correctly and 

if I understood your brief correctly, you're

 really saying that the distinction depends on 

whether this was a right at common law, and, 

here, this bears a lot of resemblance to a right 

at common law, the -- the fraud. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Am I right? Okay. 

So -- but I think part of what your colloquy 

with Justice Jackson is showing is that this 

isn't exactly fraud, and it can be kind of 

difficult to say is this just like -- I mean, it 

doesn't have to be an exact match, but how close 

is this to the common law tort of fraud? 

So what kind of a test would you 

propose for deciding whether something 

represented that common law right?  I mean, Mr. 

Fletcher's test has the virtue -- it -- it's 

very broad, but it has the virtue of being a 

pretty bright line.

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yes.  So this Court

 has held that a -- a -- a claim that serves the 

same essential function as a traditional common

 law right is -- is -- is a private right.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Does that solve

 Justice Kagan's problems?  Because couldn't you

 say that the OSHA Act did that?  You know,

 protected -- served kind of the same functions

 as -- as negligence and wrongful death suits? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  It does not serve the 

same function.  It's -- it's more -- it's --

it's addressing more --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  It's prophylactic. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  -- prophylactic and 

inchoate conduct that leads up to actual harm. 

So they're -- they're really addressing two 

different things.  And just like in the -- in 

the securities acts with what Mr. Jarkesy was 

charged with, the -- 95 percent of what's in the 

securities acts are not traditional common law 

claims.  The things that the SEC enforces every 

day, almost all of it is public rights --

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Insider trading is --

is prosecuted under the traditional fraud

 claims.  Again, the -- the fraud sections in

 10b-5 are -- and -- and they -- they were taken

 out of -- as -- as our -- our brief explains,

 they -- they were drawn largely from what was --

what -- what -- what common law fraud, how it

 was litigated at the time in the 1930s.

 And it was always a scheme, artifice, 

fraud, or misrepresentations, and that is --

those are the sections under which insider 

trading cases are -- are -- are prosecuted.

 know, the -- you get into what's the definition

 of -- of public rights versus private rights,

 and, first of all, by -- by default, claims are

 private rights.

 The public rights is -- is called, as

 this Court has called it, the public rights

 exception.  But things -- things that are --

are -- are or of or belong to the government, 

there are claims that are between an individual 

and the government only. 

So customs, immigration, benefits, 

franchises, permissions, debts to the 

government, I would put taxes under debts to the 

government, and so there are things that were 

traditionally, like customs, were always handled 

even back 240 years ago, were handled outside 

of -- of Article III, out of -- out of --

outside of courts. 

So there is -- there's that -- that 

limited universe of things that are between an 

individual and the government, but just, again, 

Granfinanciera I think resolved this and took a 

big bite out of Atlas Roofing when it rejected 

taxonomic changes, taking a common law claim,

What have been thought the hard cases 

-- Northern Pipeline, Schor, Granfinanciera, 

Stern, Oil States -- these are all private 

people on both sides of the V, and, nonetheless, 

we've held that public rights might be involved 

because their disputes are embedded in federal

McColloch.  And so I'm asking, why isn't the 

reason that the private/private cases are hard 

because the Court is concerned that what might 

be happening is Congress is shifting things that 

were traditionally common law claims adjudicated 

between private people into this administrative 

process and not people -- giving people trials 

by juries? 

Like, what makes it hard is when a 

statutory scheme looks like it could be 

displacing the normal common law private-to-

private enforcement of a fraud claim.

But I think what Justice Kagan is

 saying is that the reason why these cases, the 

ones in which the statute is giving the 

enforcement authority to the government for the 

benefit of the public, is -- are not hard and 

why people haven't continued to bring these is 

because it doesn't look anything like the common 

law scenario where we've had two private parties 

fighting over fraud and they brought it to 

court. 

Instead, Congress has created a new 

thing to supplement that private scenario or 

maybe it's brand new in any event, but it 

doesn't -- it's not a common-law-rooted kind of 

thing that is being brought in court -- I mean, 

sorry, brought in the administrative agency with 

all the concerns that many of my colleagues have 

raised. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Okay.  Well, there are 

several issues there.  I'll -- I'll try to 

remember them and -- and address them -- them 

all. And -- and all -- all good points, but 

keep in mind that the common law claims that --

that were incorporated into the securities acts 

are, in fact, litigated privately.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, they're just --

there -- there -- there's a parallel claim. 

There's the world that existed before, so a 

person who's injured by this kind of 

misrepresentation in their securities portfolio

 or whatever still has the common law scenario,

 they can go to court, bringing a fraud claim,

 right?

 I think this actually hurts you and 

your analysis.  The fact that those still exist 

mean that Congress was not trying to take those 

over, shift those away.  Congress created a new 

right, a new opportunity for the government to 

come in and for the benefit of the public make, 

yes, admittedly, a similar kind of claim, but I 

think you have to admit this is a new cause of 

action, right? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Well, I do not agree 

with that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  All right. 

So that's where we diverge. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  If you go back -- if 

you -- if you -- if you -- if you look at fraud 

claims as litigated in the 1800s and early 1900s

 claims that -- that required a right to trial by

Can I back up a second?  Mr. Fletcher 

pointed out that civil penalties were more 

recently added to the administrative process. 

If this law had been -- if this case had been 

heard previously, the SEC could have sought 

simply a cease-and-desist letter from doing 

whatever they were doing, an injunction, asked 

for disgorgement, which Justice Barrett pointed 

out was always a -- not a jury trial matter, and 

an injunction from doing certain things -- other 

things in the securities industry. 

If that had been the -- the 

administrative process and the only thing the 

SEC had asked for, would your argument be

 identical, that that -- they had to go to court

 to ask for those things?  If this is a common

 law fraud claim, but the only remedies they're 

seeking are common law remedies that don't

 require -- never required a jury, are you taking 

the position they had to go to a court

 nevertheless?

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  And -- and, Your

 Honor, your -- I think your question is -- is 

asking both under Article III and under Seventh 

Amendment.  Seventh Amendment, no. We would not 

be arguing there's a Seventh Amendment right for 

equitable relief.  Remember, the -- the -- the 

-- the test is was it a common law -- was it a 

claim recognized in the courts of England in 

1791? And, number two, was it seeking legal as 

opposed to other relief, mainly equity or 

admiralty?  And so a -- a claim for just 

disgorgement at least under the law as it 

existed until 2021, as this Court held in the 

Liu case three years ago, disgorgement is an 

equitable remedy, and this Court went back to 

look at the law pre-future equity --

and so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For private -- for

 suits.

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  But there are certain 

things that have been deemed exempt from that 

under, again, another long strain of cases, such 

as immigration, tax, et cetera, that -- and --

and Social Security is like the easiest example. 

The Chief Justice asked a little more 

difficult question about, you know, public 

health benefits, but there's a long tradition of 

Social Security.  That's a government benefit. 

You know, what the government giveth, it could 

taketh away.  It can -- and it can -- it can 

adjudicate.  And so those are just different. 

This -- the argument we're making 

affects a tiny percentage of the total things 

that are handled -- that are -- today are 

adjudicated administratively.

mentioned duties, Social Security benefits.  Are 

there others that you would like to add, or 

maybe you can refer us to some place where you 

have a full list? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  You know, immigration. 

There -- there are a number of areas. And it 

would probably be a -- a pretty long list of 

things that wouldn't be affected.  Things --

again, the -- the best example is the OSHA 

regulations.  Proper placement of -- of ceiling

fines just are not things that were ever 

recognized at common law.

Article I courts throughout the federal

 government do are, in fact, new claims that are 

regulatory issues, that don't have an analogue

 in 18th Century English practice.

 And so we're only talking about a tiny

 percentage.  And -- and, really, here, we're 

just talking about fraud claims, traditional

 fraud claims, and at least where they've been 

charged as traditional fraud claims, that -- and 

-- and I know it's kind of -- the Court's going 

to be a little concerned, do we have to do 

case-by-case-by-case-by-case analysis of this? 

Well, unfortunately, for most things, you have 

to do a case-by-case analysis. 

The -- the whole public/private rights 

doctrine is frankly a mess.  It's not the 

Court's fault.  It's because it's so -- it's a 

very difficult, vexing issue.  And -- and this 

Court has declined actually to specifically 

define it itself.  And maybe that's what you're 

asking us. 

And so I don't mean to punt on the

a big change in the law.  And, you know, may --

when a -- a -- a common law claim or something

 approximating the -- the same purposes of a 

common law claim that existed 200 years ago in

 England, that is -- is thrown into a statutory

trial by jury, just like in Granfinanciera.  It 

was in an Article I bankruptcy court, and the

 Court held even -- they left -- this Court left 

alone whether or not that Article I assignment 

was okay.  They left that alone and just sort 

of, okay, let's assume it is. We're still going

that were securities-type cases, fraud cases.

 There was one case that we cite in our brief 

that was rendered King v. Cawood in 1790, the 

year before the Seventh Amendment was enacted,

 where the government civilly prosecuted for

 penalties Mr. Cawood for violation of a

 financial fraud -- a financial statute.

 So this -- this is a fraud claim.

 They allege misrepresentations.  They allege --

they allege reliance.  They allege materiality. 

And they allege damages. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, were they 

required to allege all those things? 

MR. McCOLLOCH: They were not 

necessarily required to, but they did, and they 

usually do. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do -- could we decide 

this case on the narrow ground that the 

statutory securities fraud claims are 

sufficiently close to a common law fraud action 

because the elements of the statutory claim are 

a logical subset of the latter?

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Well, I don't think

that inquiry -- that -- that's been well 

settled.  Plenty of cases allowing immigration, 

customs, all of those areas to be -- to be 

adjudicated administratively by the executive 

branch and, again, were -- were done back in the

1800s --

in common law for fraud? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  If you defrauded the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.  But 

they're not charging you here with defrauding 

the government. They're not claiming injury to 

the individual -- to other individuals.  They're

penalties for the individual's own injury? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  In this case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I didn't say this

into court and seeks recovery under the SEC for 

a securities fraud, can they collect penalties 

on behalf of the government?

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  Okay, Your Honor.  The 

-- the substantive elements are the same, which 

I think is the end of the inquiry, but to take

 it further, the SEC takes those penalties, 

according to them, they take most of the

 penalties and most of the disgorgement money 

that they take in and return it to the victims.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know --

MR. McCOLLOCH:  And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that's --

that's very generous of the government, but it's 

not -- you know, I can give my money to charity, 

but it's not the Court's right to -- the Court 

doing that.  It's the SEC choosing to do that. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  The SEC --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just like the 

victim could choose and probably does give the 

government some of the money in taxation.  I'm 

not sure if penalties are exempt or not. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Well, and -- and

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. McColloch, if you 

look at the history of the securities 

legislation in this country, a lot of it came 

into effect, of course, after the Great 

Depression, and then there were -- would have 

been two more recent tranches.  One came after 

the savings and loan crisis, and the other came 

after the 2008 Great Recession, if you want to 

call it that. 

And each time Congress thought, you 

know, something is going terribly wrong here and 

people are being defrauded and people are being 

harmed.  And these common law suits that you're 

talking about were not solving the problem. 

And Congress said:  We have to give 

the SEC responsibilities.  We have to give them 

powers.  We have to give them greater 

authorities.  And I guess what I'm wondering is 

when you say, well, we should go back to the

common law suits that were brought 200 years ago

 Congress's judgment after the depression, after 

the savings and loan crisis, after the Great

 Recession, is Congress's judgment that more 

powers were needed within an administrative

 agency entitled to no respect?

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  No, it's entitled to 

lots of respect. And, again, everything that 

the -- that the securities acts do and 

everything the SEC does we support.  And it 

doesn't have -- it's -- it's not a matter of not 

respecting Congress. 

Congress acted appropriately, except 

insofar as they eventually in 1990 and then in 

19 -- in 1990, when they allowed the SEC to sue 

people outside of -- of the regulatory universe, 

people that were regulated and registered, they 

gave them the authority to -- to come after any 

person and then, in Dodd-Frank in 2010, allowed 

them to get penalties against any person.  They 

didn't really use that power against any person 

when they couldn't get penalties.  And so, as 

soon as they got the penalty authority, that's 

when they could go after any person for

and I believe the Fifth Circuit's holding is 

that basic securities fraud allegations, whether 

they're inside or outside of a statutory scheme,

 the -- the government is required to take the

 case, again, under all of the other elements 

we've talked about, it's required to take the 

case in front of a jury if the -- if -- if their 

target wants a jury trial. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And Congress is free 

to prescribe that and extend that and expand it 

any way it wants. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It just can't take 

away a person's right to be heard before his 

peers. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Correct.  And for that 

matter, the SEC could fix this problem by itself 

this afternoon by giving people the option.  The 

problem here is that it's mandatory.  It's 

coercive.  Most of the other cases, situations 

at other agencies, people have an opt-out or 

they can choose which -- which forum they go in. 

The problem here is that it's

unilaterally strip your Seventh Amendment and a

 number of other rights away.  By choosing that

 forum --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.

 that in a heartbeat.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Kavanaugh? 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.  Two 

questions.  For those cases that are covered by 

your rule, whatever the scope of that is, 

agencies, I think, under your -- your approach 

could still bring those same suits in federal 

court, so there would still be full enforcement 

of all the regulatory statutes, environmental, 

securities, what have you. 

But Mr. -- so I think I understand 

your point on that.  But Mr. Fletcher says 

that's still a big problem because Congress 

would have to enact statutes that allowed 

agencies that don't have the authority to go to 

federal court to do so, and he says that would 

be a burden on federal courts.

And I just want to get any response

 you might have to that.

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  If -- if -- if there's

 a -- if there's a common law claim for penalties 

embedded in some of those statutes, then the

 answer is yes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, that's not

 the question.  The question is what's -- what --

what about the burden on federal courts that Mr. 

Fletcher raised, respond to that, and then the 

burden on agency enforcement for those agencies 

that don't have the authority to seek federal 

civil penalties in federal court now. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  I could -- I could 

speak most authoritatively to -- to -- to the 

SEC and what effect it would have there. The 

SEC, seeing the handwriting on the wall, has 

already, I believe, withdrawn or returned its --

its securities fraud cases back to federal 

court. So this whole notion of choking the 

federal courts with lots and lots of cases is --

it didn't happen because they've already been 

returned to the federal courts.  Soon after they 

got this authority in 2010, it went way up, and 

then these constitutional challenges started

 And so I don't think -- in fact, I

 think the -- the impact at the SEC if this Court

 upholds the Fifth Circuit on the Seventh

 Amendment will be zero.  It'll be virtual --

 virtually nothing.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And then

 second question is, if you're asking us, as some 

of the questions suggest, to scale back, narrow 

a precedent of ours in order that an individual 

has a right to federal court rather than an 

in-house tribunal, before we do that, we should 

know that it's more than just housekeeping, that 

it matters.  And you haven't really said, you 

know, it really matters to be in federal court 

rather than an in-house agency tribunal, and 

here's your opportunity. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  You mean it matters 

constitutionally or as a practical --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No.  No. Matters, 

like, you know, we could change precedent, but 

if it doesn't have any impact other than 

housekeeping of where you file your briefs, 

which tribunal you file it in, then, you know,

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I have a question 

about equitable remedies.  So, when I talked to 

Mr. Fletcher about whether the SEC would still 

be able to get injunctive relief and 

disgorgement, because they're equitable 

remedies, Mr. Fletcher expressed concern that 

the Court, in deciding the Seventh Amendment 

question in your favor, might actually limit the 

ability of agencies to get equitable remedies. 

And then, when Justice Sotomayor asked 

you some questions about that, you said the 

Seventh Amendment would not stand as a barrier 

in that context, but Article III would. 

So, if we decided in your favor on the 

Seventh Amendment question, do you think that 

would necessarily resolve any kind of Article 

III question?  And if not, why did you even

public/private right analysis is even necessary 

to resolve this case under the Seventh 

Amendment, which is the issue that was raised 

below, the issue that was ruled on below. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But doesn't it bear 

on it? Because, if you're looking to see what 

was a suit at common law, I mean, isn't that 

private right? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  I will say most of the 

time, 95 percent of the time, the analysis under 

public/private rights and the analysis under

 the same result.

 And that's why this -- this construct 

has worked for the last 50, 60 years, and maybe 

no one's challenged it for -- for that reason. 

And that's why we're saying we can -- we can

 live with Atlas Roofing because Atlas Roofing 

properly construed and as it's been

 substantially modified by a number of subsequent 

decisions comes to the same result. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So is -- let's see. 

You said that on the Seventh Amendment question, 

our deciding in your favor would work a very 

small change? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: But it sounds to me 

that what you're really hoping for deep down is 

a really big change because you want even the 

equitable remedies cases out of agencies too. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  We don't have --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Is that --

MR. McCOLLOCH:  -- a position on that. 

We -- because we're not here -- Jarkesy does not 

have an equitable remedy issue to -- to worry

Roofing, and I'm trying to understand why, and 

I'm reading the part of Atlas Roofing where 

they're describing the past cases that they've 

-- that the Court is relying on. And it seems 

as though the basic proposition is, when 

Congress creates new statutory public rights, it 

may assign their adjudication to an 

administrative agency with which a jury trial 

would be incompatible without violating the 

Seventh Amendment's injunction that jury trial 

is to be preserved in suits at common law. 

All right. So I think that's the sort 

of basic proposition, and I understand your 

argument to be this is not the creation of a new

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So 

Justice Sotomayor asks and Justice Kagan asked a 

lot of questions probing that part of this. And 

so your answer is, even though the elements are 

different, there's some overlap, as Justice

 Gorsuch points out.  But are the elements of

 this 10b-5 action the same on all fours with 

common law fraud? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Yes, as -- as -- as 

they were alleged in this case.  Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: But I'm not talking 

about the allegations.  I'm talking about the 

elements, what the government had to prove in 

order to establish a violation of 10b-5. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  They are substantially 

the same and certainly serve the same essential 

function as -- as a -- as a traditional --

 Congress -- the -- the Court here still said it

 was new statutory claim.  It described the

 circumstances under which it arise -- it arose

 and called it new.

 So I guess I'm trying to understand

 why here, even though you're right, the

 allegations, one could have made perhaps a

 standard common law fraud claim out of the 

allegations, if the elements of the statutory 

claim are different, why are you suggesting that 

it is not new? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Well, so I would push 

back on -- on the notion that the OSHA 

regulatory prophylactic claims sound in tort. 

They don't sound in tort. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Because? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Because you don't have 

to have any injury.  If -- if -- again --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Do you have to have 

injury here as an element? 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  You do not have to 

have injury as an element, but to get damages, 

you do, so you don't get penalties. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: No, I understand, 

but -- but as an element, right, you say the

OSHA claims didn't have the injury element. We

 don't have that element here either.  So why are 

these claims old and those claims new?

 MR. McCOLLOCH:  Be -- because those

 claims are -- again, they're so -- they're so 

prophylactic as to whether your ceiling cover is 

in exactly the right position, no one could sue 

in tort over that because there's no -- there --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Because the duty is 

arising out of the -- the -- the statutory --

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Only out of the 

statute. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And the 

duty here is arising out of the statute in the 

same way, I think, but let me just ask you this. 

You keep talking about Granfinanciera, if I'm 

pronouncing it correct.  I guess I'm a little 

worried about the rule that you're asking us to 

adopt insofar as it's suggesting that it doesn't 

have to be a common law claim that Congress has 

appropriated on all fours with all the elements. 

It can be something that is like a 

common law claim.

know where that comes from because the 

Granfinanciera case, it was the fraudulent 

conveyance claim. It was the sort of scary

 scenario in which Congress is moving actual 

common law claims into the administrative

 process or in -- in that case into the 

bankruptcy process, and the Court rightly said 

no, I'm sorry, you have a Seventh Amendment 

problem with doing that. 

So I -- I don't know that 

Granfinanciera gives you the rule that we have 

previously held that something that looks like a 

common law claim, even though it's statutorily 

new, raises the same kind of Seventh Amendment 

issue. 

MR. McCOLLOCH:  Well, you know, so, 

really, what Granfinanciera stands for in this 

case is -- is, again, the condemnation of 

taxonomic changes and -- and it --

actions that the Board was taking or just had to 

tolerate those actions because of the strict

 removal protection. 

Now apply those same questions here

 and you get exactly the opposite results.  Here, 

we know exactly what the Commission thinks about 

the ALJ's decision in this case because the 

Commission had the right to and exercised the

 right to conduct plenary review, adopt parts of 

it, and reject other parts of it. 

I think that's constitutionally 

adequate means of supervision of adjudicative 

officers.  We think that's the lesson from the 

plurality opinion in Arthrex. 

Also, in Free Enterprise Fund, this 

Court said the most telling problem with the 

scheme it confronted there was its novelty. 

That's the through line of this Court's recent 

cases like Seila Law, like Arthrex, like 

Collins. 

No foothold in history or tradition is 

a telling constitutional problem.  Here, it goes 

the other way.  The removal protection for ALJs 

has been a central feature of administrative law 

since the APA.

Now, on the Seventh Amendment,

 obviously, the focus is Atlas Roofing.  And I

 think my friend has to do one of three things.

 He has to distinguish it, he has to convince you 

that you've overruled it already, or he has to 

convince you that you should overrule it now. 

And I don't think he's done any of those.

 So, first of all, on distinguishing 

it, I think it's helpful to be very concrete 

about what was at issue in Atlas Roofing.  The 

statute at issue there said, and I quote, "that 

employees had a right to be at a workplace free 

from recognized hazards that were likely to 

cause serious injury or death." 

What had happened was that one 

employer failed to shore up a trench and it 

collapsed and an employee died, and another 

employee fell through an open roof and died. 

Those things could have been the basis 

for wrongful death or negligence actions 

evaluated under very similar standards, and yet 

the Court had no problem saying that they were 

validly enforced through administrative 

proceedings because Congress had created a 

federal statutory scheme.

 It has done the same thing here.  The

 securities laws serve different purposes than 

the common law of fraud. Congress is not just 

taking and federalizing disputes between private

 parties adjudicated in courts of common law.  I

 think the clearest indication of that is this 

Court's decision in Kokesh, which explained why 

the remedies that the SEC gets, even when they

 are monetary or compensatory, are not for 

private parties.  They are remedies for a public 

wrong and they are therefore properly considered 

penalties.  I think, for much the same reason, 

this is not the case where you have a concern 

about circumvention of the common law rights. 

I think the other thing that I would 

say is that he has tried to convince you that 

you've overruled Atlas Roofing already in 

Granfinanciera, but the parts of the opinion 

that he is talking about and, with respect, 

Justice Gorsuch, that you have quoted are about 

suits between private parties. 

When you talk about suits involving 

the government, Granfinanciera is explicit.  It 

says, "even when Congress does something that is 

closely analogous," that's a quote from the

common law, or effectively supplants a common 

law cause of action with a new statutory cause

 of action enforced by the government, that is

 something that it can assign to an

 administrative tribunal.

 So, finally, that leaves him, I think, 

asking you to overrule Atlas Roofing in one way 

or another, on Seventh Amendment or on public

 rights, and I think there are several reasons 

not to do that. 

One is that my friend just hasn't 

asked. As Justice Sotomayor said, the words 

"stare decisis" do not appear in his brief. 

Even now, I don't think he has grappled with the 

practical consequences of adopting any of the 

rules that he has offered, and I also don't 

think he's given you a new principle to adopt. 

So I take the point, Justice Alito, 

about immigration cases and tax cases and 

customs cases.  In some ways, those sound like 

public rights, but the cases involve the 

imposition of penalties, the requirement of 

private parties to pay penalties for violating 

those statutes. 

If you look at it from a private

party's perspective, that's private property

 just like the civil penalty here.  The Seventh

 Amendment and Article III don't apply 

differently in the immigration space. When the 

government seeks immigration penalties in court, 

it has to do it in front of a jury.

 So the reason why the government can 

get administrative penalties in immigration 

cases and in those other cases is because that 

is not an invasion of Article III.  It is not a 

violation of the Seventh Amendment.  And for the 

reasons that the Court said in Atlas Roofing, 

the same thing is true here. 

So, finally, I would just like to say, 

you know, going back to this Court's decision in 

Brackeen last year, the Court said the parties 

before us have raised real concerns with our 

past precedent.  They've made arguments based on 

history. 

But they haven't taken on the burden 

that we expect parties to take on when they ask 

us to overrule precedent.  They haven't 

acknowledged what they're asking for.  They 

haven't grappled with practice and principle, 

and so whatever those arguments might be in a

 I think you should do the same thing

 today. I think you can reverse the decision

 below and uphold the Securities and Exchange

 Act's provisions at issue here without going one 

inch beyond Atlas Roofing. And I think a

that basis would leave the law exactly where you 

found it today.
