 (10:05 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-193, Muldrow 

versus the City of St. Louis.

 Mr. Wolfman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Jatonya Muldrow maintains she was 

transferred from the Intelligence Division to a 

different job in the Fifth District because 

she's a woman.  That's sex discrimination, and 

it's unlawful under the plain terms of 

Title VII. 

Title VII bars an employer from 

discriminating against an employee with respect 

to the terms, conditions, or privileges of her 

employment because of the employee's sex. 

Respondent now concedes that a lateral transfer 

changes the terms, conditions, or privileges of 

employment.  After all, a transferred employee 

cannot show up the next day and do her old job. 

Her job tasks have changed, and that's the most

basic term of employment.

 So the only question left is whether

 transferring an employee because of sex is

 discrimination against that person.  It is. 

"Discrimination against" by its ordinary meaning

 and under this Court's precedent means worse

 treatment because of a protected characteristic.

 With that, statutory analysis is

 complete, which brings us to what 703(a)(1) does 

not do.  It doesn't require that an employer's 

conduct cause significant disadvantage, 

objective material harm, objective tangible 

harm, or the like.  And contrary to the Eighth 

Circuit's understanding, as this Court observed 

in Teamsters, Title VII provides for equal 

opportunity to compete for any job, whether it 

is thought better or worse than another.  The 

statute prohibits discrimination, period. 

If an employer transfers an employee 

because of a protected characteristic, that's 

discrimination, and it's prohibited by 

Title VII. 

The Court should reverse and allow 

Ms. Muldrow to prove her case. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, you said

 that -- in -- in your opening remarks that worse

 treatment against a protect -- member of a

 protected class is a Title VII violation.  What 

is the worse treatment here?

 MR. WOLFMAN: The worse treatment here

 is the discrimination itself.  So differential

 treatment and worse treatment are almost in very 

-- invariably coterminous.  And, here, the worse 

treatment is she was treated differently than a 

male employee in the same circumstances, and we 

are prepared to prove that if we're given the 

opportunity. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So the -- it doesn't 

matter if her salary is the same, the work 

arrangements are the same.  I know you -- your 

argument in the briefs is that her assignments 

changed, but her pay did not and her rank did 

not. But none of that is necessary for you 

under -- in your -- under your argument to make 

a claim. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That is correct, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  The mere transfer is 

enough?

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the -- the

 transfer -- we wouldn't say "mere" in this

 particular case with respect, Your Honor, but --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, transfer alone.

 MR. WOLFMAN: -- but the transfer 

itself makes the claim actionable if she was 

treated differently than a male employee would 

be under the same circumstances.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what work does the 

preposition "against" provide? 

MR. WOLFMAN: It -- it provides that 

the treatment has to be worse, and there may be 

circumstances which --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So how is it worse --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- limited circumstances 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- though? I mean, 

you're saying two things.  One, you say that the 

mere transfer is enough and "against" adds 

nothing, or it may -- or it requires that the 

treatment be worse.  But I don't -- beyond the 

mere transfer, you don't argue that you need 

anything else. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That -- that is correct 

with respect to -- that is absolutely correct.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what work does

 "against" do?

 MR. WOLFMAN: The -- the word

 "against" is -- is indicating that the -- the 

operation of the conduct is against this

 particular employee.  So that's the work that

 the -- the word "against" is doing.

 It could be -- it could be that it's 

just for emphasis, and there may be limited 

circumstances, as this Court in -- indicated in 

Bostock, where, you know, different treatment 

among men and women is not necessarily 

discrimination. 

But, by and large, when a -- a male 

employee, if we're taking sex discrimination, is 

treated differently from a female employee in 

similar circumstances or would be treated 

differently, that's discrimination against, in 

this case, the female employee. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You refer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to Bostock --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

refers to distinctions or differences in

 treatment that injure protected individuals.  So 

that formulation suggests that there are 

distinctions or differences in treatment that

 don't injure protected individuals, in other

 words, that -- that the injury is a added thing 

that one has to show in a discrimination suit.

 Do you not read that statement that

 way? 

MR. WOLFMAN: I do not.  I think, 

generally speaking, the -- the injury is the 

discrimination itself.  That's this Court's 

decision in Heckler versus Mathews. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, it's a funny 

sentence to write if that's what we thought, and 

then we can talk about whether -- in fact, we 

can think about many kinds of distinctions and 

differences that don't injure anybody, but -- or 

that don't injure the -- the -- the -- that 

person at least. 

But it's a -- it's a funny sentence to 

write, distinctions or differences in treatment 

that injure protected individuals, if you think 

that all distinctions and differences injure 

protected individuals.

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, not necessarily

 all distinctions, but -- the way I would put it 

is that in the vast majority of circumstances,

 differential treatment and worse treatment are 

going to be the same thing, and that is that --

that injury is going to occur in the vast 

majority of circumstances when there is

 discrimination.

 That's this Court's decision, I -- I 

believe, in Heckler versus Mathews.  That's in a 

sense a premise of the Brown decision, that, you 

know, discrimination itself is injurious. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And isn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- isn't "terms and 

conditions of employment" doing some work as 

well? I mean, you -- you say that that's a 

conceded part of the statute, and I -- with 

respect to how they're interpreting it, and --

and I understand that, but I would guess that 

differential treatment with respect to the terms 

and conditions of employment may be what you 

mean when you say that --

that "terms, conditions, and privileges" are --

"discriminate against" as Justice Kagan was 

positing it.  You know, she's -- she's 

highlighted a distinction between discrimination 

against someone that injures them versus 

discrimination that might not injure them.

 trivial.  But, if they're distributed on the 

basis of race, immediately that becomes

 nontrivial.

 And I think most people understand 

that intuitively, that if those pens are

 distributed -- distributed on the basis of race,

 that could be stigmatizing.  In a sense -- I

 realize that -- that pens are not public

to one water fountain and another set of people 

to another water fountain is stigmatic injury. 

So -- so I accept that point.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I mean, because you 

started with, you know, you know, making people

 worse. I mean, there are differences and 

distinctions that people can make on the -- on

 the basis of protected characteristics that make

 people better off, right?

 I mean, if -- if I decide one day

 that, you know, every woman in my workplace 

should get a raise, I mean, that makes women 

better off. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That is correct, and --

and -- and that -- if that is publicly known, 

that could be stigmatizing, in effect, both to 

the women and to the men.  And can I explain 

why? 

To -- to the women, it might be that 

if we're doing this solely on the basis of sex, 

the person might say to themself, well, I earned 

this, I earned this raise, and now it's being 

meted out on the basis of my sex or race or 

national origin. 

Now, of course, in your circumstance,

done publicly.  If it's done privately, it's

 still denigrating and demeaning even if it is 

not stigmatizing. And, you know, that's what

 this statute is -- is going at.

 Now what I do --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But are you saying

 then, if the employer wants to increase 

diversity in the workplace and so promotes, say, 

some black employees and they get better jobs, 

then that's discrimination? 

MR. WOLFMAN: That poses -- I want to 

answer that question, but I -- I also want to 

say that that is -- is not posed by this case. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I understand that --

MR. WOLFMAN: Of course, I know you 

know -- I --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- but it seems to 

me the answer you just gave Justice Kagan would 

logically apply to that situation. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, it -- it -- it's a 

difficult question because, if -- if -- if a 

employer has an affirmative action plan, that 

calls up this Court's decision in Weber and 

Johnson, and it would have to be evaluated in 

terms of the -- the guidelines set out in Weber

 analysis for, you know --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Well, let me

 take the example --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- this grievant and

 affirmative action.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- you just gave,

 then I'll put race to one side. 

The example you just gave, you said it 

would be actionable under Justice Kagan's 

hypothetical of all women promoted.  What if 

it's we want to have a, you know, face first, we 

want women out there, we want to promote women, 

we want to show that we are friendly to women, 

let's say it's a law firm and there's -- you 

know, the numbers of female partners are low and 

so they want to bring that up. 

That's actionable? 

MR. WOLFMAN: I'm -- I'm not sure. 

This is -- is this some sort of requirement? I

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.  I think that it --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- employer agrees. 

And it sounds to me like you were saying that

 was actionable discrimination.

 MR. WOLFMAN: -- if there is a 

privilege of employment that is meted out on the

 basis of sex, that is actionable.  And I think,

 you know, I can turn back to Justice Kagan's 

hypothetical and, again, if -- if women are 

being given raises just because they're women, 

then that is actionable and also, as I say, 

potentially stigmatizing to the women. 

And -- and if it's being given out not 

to the men simply on the basis of race, of 

course, they have a claim as well. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't think the --

the problem that's presented by this case -- and 

it's a -- it's a difficult problem -- is whether 

there are forms of disparate treatment that are 

benign. 

I would say that all disparate 

treatment based on race, sex, et cetera, is 

wrong, but I think the insight, right -- right 

or wrong, of the courts that have imposed 

something like a significant disadvantage

 based on one of these characteristics is wrong,

 there should be some sort of threshold before it 

gets into court, and that's where the de minimis

 idea comes from.

 But you say there -- there shouldn't 

even be a de minimis exemption.

 position, but I want to take your question in a 

couple stages if I may. 

The first is a significant 

disadvantage rule and these -- the others that 

are similar, objective tangible harm, objective 

harm and so forth that you see in the circuits, 

have not been applied in anything like a de 

minimis way, and you see that in the -- in --

 says -- the employee says, on Monday morning,

this is not a requirement of the job.  That --

privilege of employment is.

 you, counsel.  If this is your position, I don't 

understand the bulk of your brief. The bulk of 

your brief talks about different, you know, 

locations, different facilities, she has to wear 

a uniform, different hours, no weekend, 

different access to, you know, superiors. 

Under your theory, all of that is 

completely irrelevant.  And as far as the terms 

and conditions of employment, that was not your 

argument in the brief.  The argument in your 

brief was there's no requirement.  And then you 

go on and list all these things that would count 

under normal circumstances, I would think, as 

adverse consequences.

MR. WOLFMAN: Your Honor, the reason 

that is in our brief is we -- we were laying out

 the harm that these rules like significant 

disadvantage have done in the circuits, and this 

goes back to Justice Alito's question.

           Significant disadvantage, as this 

Court itself said in Groff, is nothing like de

 minimis. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, 

just to be clear, if none of that was in your 

brief, your argument would be the same? No --

as far as we know, hours were the same. She did 

not have to wear a uniform.  Access to superiors 

would be, you know, absolutely the same. 

Everything is the same except --

MR. WOLFMAN: That -- that is correct, 

Your Honor.

MR. WOLFMAN: No.  But -- but I think

 attempting to do in our brief was to discuss the 

very things that have been coming up, the

 de minimis exception, coming up in all the lower

 court cases, and with the expectation that we

 would be asked these questions.

 But if the Court -- the Court narrowed 

the question to transfers, and if the Court 

wishes to decide this case solely on the basis 

of transfers, my client is perfectly happy with 

that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we limited 

the question to transfers, and you gave us 

arguments talking about terms and conditions and 

the various ways in which there was actual 

injury? 

MR. WOLFMAN: That is correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

Justice Thomas?

JUSTICE ALITO:  There -- there are a 

number of significant differences between the 

two positions here, no question about it, but 

just to -- to give you a hypothetical that's

employee says, they transferred me from the desk 

job, which is safe and interesting to -- to me, 

that's what I'm interested in, to the street 

job, which is more dangerous and not interesting

 to me. That would -- that would qualify, right?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it was the 

opposite way around and the employee -- this 

particular employee said, I don't want to sit at

MR. WOLFMAN: That is Teamsters.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- I -- I mean, 

discrimination, I can't emphasize it too much,

 on any of these grounds is morally wrong.  The 

question is whether it's the stuff of the

 district court case.

 One more question.  Some of our 

Supreme Court police officers prefer to work the

 day shift and some prefer to work the night 

shift. So, if someone is transferred from the 

night shift, which a lot of people wouldn't 

like, to the day shift, that may be viewed as an 

injury by that particular officer, right, and 

that would be enough? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely actionable. 

That's what -- that -- that's the -- the -- the 

Threat decision in the Sixth Circuit. That's 

the Hamilton decision in the Fifth Circuit. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what if it's the 

other --

MR. WOLFMAN: Shift changes --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- what if it's the 

other way around? 

MR. WOLFMAN: -- shift changes on the 

basis of race or sex are unlawful.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, just to make

 clear I understand what you're saying, you're

 that the fact of discrimination satisfies the

 injury requirement in all but the most 

extraordinary case? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, yes, I mean, and 

the -- you know, I -- I -- I don't want to put 

my toes in too deep, but this was what was 

reserved in Bostock and clearly does not have to 

be dealt with here, which is, you know, there --

there may be deep-seated understandings and --

that people never think of sex-segregated 

bathrooms as discrimination.  That's correct. 

What -- this goes back to the point I 

made earlier, Your Honor, which is that 

differential treatment is almost invariably 

worse treatment if it's done on a basis of a 

protected characteristic.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  There was some

 suggestion in some of the amici -- we have so

 many amici -- that employers might respond to a

 decision in -- in your client's favor by 

redefining the terms, conditions, and privileges

 of employment so that you may be reassigned

 here, there, or wherever.

 And I want your thoughts about that.

understand the question, Your Honor --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So --

MR. WOLFMAN: -- with all respect. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, no, fair enough. 

That -- that's my fault. So what if an employer 

says, your job isn't defined as sitting at a 

desk or walking the rounds around the building 

or whatever it may be or being on the beat, but 

it is defined as any of those things so that 

there is -- it isn't a term or condition of 

employment that you are a desk job or on the 

beat?

 no. If that determination that you're

that would be actionable under Title VII.  That 

may be very difficult to prove, I understand, 

but that would still be actionable.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then I want to 

give you a chance to just flesh out your

 position, which I understand has been subject to

 some questioning this morning, that -- that in

 adopting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress 

sought to root out discrimination, root and 

branch, and that all of it is impermissible, and 

presumptively injurious. 

MR. WOLFMAN: That is our position, 

and if I could take you to the words of the 

statute as to why we know that's so.  The 

statute prohibits discriminatory hiring and 

discharging, and the purpose of "terms, 

conditions, and privileges" is to catch 

everything else between those two endpoints, and 

that's how we know that it's meant to eradicate 

discrimination in the workplace. It doesn't do 

it perfectly, but that's the intent.

reaches of what "terms, conditions, or

 correct as well?

 MR. WOLFMAN: A -- a -- a transfer 

decision, to either withhold a transfer or to 

give a transfer, is the functional equivalent of

 a hiring decision or a discharge decision.  If

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So let's say that I 

think the phrase "discriminate against" carries 

with it, scoops in with it, some sort of injury, 

but I also think -- you know, the QP was 

restricted to transfers, but I also think that 

you can look at a transfer -- it must be looked 

at objectively, but yet, in the eyes -- because 

transfers can change depending on the eye of the 

beholder, right?  You had some questions like 

that. I prefer the day shift, you prefer the 

night shift. 

But it has to be understanding all the

mother who wants the day shift so that her hours 

align with her children's hours or school and,

 you know, the supervisor says, I don't really 

want to work with women and I'm on the day

 shift, so I'm putting you on the night shift.

 For her, understanding her facts and 

circumstances, an objective person in her

 situation would consider that injurious. 

MR. WOLFMAN: I -- I -- I agree with 

that, but I -- I do want to offer a -- a caveat 

to that, which is -- so I -- I certainly agree 

that a person in those circumstances is likely 

to view that as injurious. 

But you -- you are suggesting that 

there would be some sort of test that sort of 

marries subjective and objective, sort of 

objective but looking at it from the 

circumstances of the particular individual, and 

that worries me for two reasons. 

First, the -- the -- the statute 

doesn't train on that. The track -- the -- the 

statute only asks questions about the employer's 

conduct.

think it is -- let's see -- I'm sorry to 

interrupt you, but I don't think the premise of 

your response is quite capturing what I think.

 I don't see it as a blending of

 objective and subjective because we do that all 

the time like, say, in -- in torts.  It's the 

reasonable man. I mean, so we're trying to

 avoid the eggshell Title VII plaintiff, right?

 We're saying a reasonable person in 

the circumstance of the plaintiff would 

experience this as an injury, and I don't think 

that's a subjective inquiry.  It's putting an 

objective inquiry but just familiar with the 

facts and circumstances. 

MR. WOLFMAN: Okay.  I -- I -- I 

accept that, that it's objective under -- under 

your description of it, but I -- I think that is 

not what the words of the statute call for. 

The -- the statute asks three questions about 

the employer's conduct, is it a term or 

condition, is -- is it with respect to a 

protected characteristic, and did the employer 

act with discriminatory intent. That's what the 

statute calls for. 

And my concern is also a practical

and the amicus briefs. You see case after case

 after case under the so-called objective 

standards, the one that used to exist in the 

D.C. Circuit, the one that exists in the Eighth 

Circuit, where things, you know, wildly

 different than what anyone would view as 

de minimis are being thrown out of court.

 And I -- I'll -- I'll end with this, 

which is that the Fifth Circuit in its recent 

en banc decision, 14 members of the court said 

these doctrines are thwarting legitimate claims 

of workplace bias.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess I'm 

really confused and a little bit worried about 

your concession to Justice Kagan that there is 

some sort of injury requirement here.  I -- I 

look at the text of the statute, and it seems to 

be doing what you said at the end with respect 

to Justice Barrett, which is identifying when 

there are unlawful employment practices. 

So the statute begins, "It shall be an

unlawful employment practice for an employer," 

and then we skip down, "to discriminate against 

any individual with respect to the terms and 

conditions," et cetera, of its employment 

because of these protected characteristics.

 So, to the extent that we are 

identifying sort of what is morally

 reprehensible, what is unlawful, I suppose we're 

just saying when someone discriminates with 

respect to these terms and conditions. 

So then the question, I guess, is what 

does it mean to discriminate, and I don't know 

that that necessarily means that there has to be 

some sort of injury. 

As I look at Bostock, you know, we 

have a -- a definition in Bostock that 

"discriminate" means roughly the same as it 

meant in 1964, "to make a difference in 

treatment or favor of one as compared to 

others." 

MR. WOLFMAN: Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  That doesn't 

necessarily mean injury.

 injurious. Let's say it's the best thing that

 ever happened to them because it was a terrible 

job, and they're fired and, you know, they go on

 to do great things in another area, and the

MR. WOLFMAN: -- the discrimination

 itself.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- can we just 

clarify, because, to the extent you're talking

 about that injury, you're talking about standing

 injury, right?

 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I'm talking about 

discrimination being an injury unto itself in

 all but the most unusual cases. That was my 

back-and-forth with Justice Kagan. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's just when 

it happens.  I mean, Congress is just saying, if 

this -- if discrimination happens, we have an 

unlawful thing, and so then the question is what 

does it mean to discriminate.  I thought we said 

in Bostock to treat someone differently because 

of this characteristic. 

Whether or not the person can go on to 

establish or has to establish that they were 

actually injured by that, I'm worried, and I 

thought that's what the issue was in this case. 

Do we have a separate element that a person who 

has been treated differently on the basis of

MR. WOLFMAN: Well, what -- what I

 would say is that they have to prove no injury

 other than the discrimination itself.  There's

 no heightened harm requirement.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And let

 me just ask you one --

MR. WOLFMAN: There's no additional

 harm requirement.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- one last question 

about that.  To the extent that we're worried 

that people who have not suffered any actual 

concrete harm as a result of this discrimination 

are bringing these lawsuits, I'm wondering 

whether or not that's not taken care of in 

damages because, at the end of the day, you 

bring your lawsuit, and if you've been 

transferred to exactly the same position, you 

say that to a jury, and they say, fine, you 

might have been discriminated against, but your 

damages are zero because you haven't shown any 

harm for which you need to be compensated. 

Am I thinking about that correctly? 

MR. WOLFMAN: That -- that is -- that 

is correct, and we make this point at -- at some 

length in our opening brief and we reiterate in

our reply brief that the idea that, you know, 

frivolous claims or marginal claims are going to

 come through is very unlikely.  One -- one needs

 to have damages to have, you know, a sensibly 

viable case to bring in federal court.

 And one of the reasons that we and 

amici talk about the kinds of cases that are

 being brought in the federal courts and being 

thwarted is they're all in the heartland. I 

mean, the transfers may be most in the 

heartland, but we see cases about denials of 

training on the basis of race. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, indeed, that 

is -- that is the work of the stuff that the 

Chief Justice is talking about in this case, 

right? You want to show that this person 

actually was harmed in the sense that she could 

bring a case and get damages from the jury 

because something, you know, happened to her, 

but it's not an element of making the claim, 

correct? 

MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AIMEE W. BROWN

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MS. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Forcing an employee to transfer 

because she is a woman is discriminating against 

her with respect to the terms and conditions of 

employment under Title VII regardless of whether 

one position is significantly worse than the 

other. 

That's the plain meaning of the text, 

and it's consistent with this Court's 

longstanding precedents, which recognize that 

the statute strikes at the entire spectrum of 

disparate treatment in employment. 

The City fights against the clear text 

principally by claiming that the phrase 

"discriminate against" incorporates a 

significant disadvantage requirement.  But to 

"discriminate against" simply means drawing 

distinctions that injure protected individuals. 

And this Court has repeatedly 

recognized that being denied equal treatment

because of a protected characteristic gives rise

 to an actionable harm. That's all the statute

 requires.

 The City's contrary reading would

 permit employers to designate a predominantly

 Hispanic store, as in the Seventh Circuit's 

AutoZone decision, to give only men their shift

 preferences, to pay Black employees $1 less, or

 to relegate Muslim employees to the back of a 

store. Those results are inconsistent with the 

statute Congress enacted.  The Court should 

reverse and instruct the lower courts to apply 

the text as written. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Can you have 

discrimination that is perceived by someone who 

is, say, you say that this is law enforcement 

and we need in this particular precinct more 

black or Hispanic officers, and so you are moved 

or transferred because of race? 

MS. BROWN:  So there is a -- I -- I 

think that that is a discrimination claim and 

that would be actionable, and -- and that would 

qualify.  There is a bona fide occupational 

qualification exception --

 which it's -- it's permitted or there is a

 business necessity or -- or Congress thinks that 

that could be justified within the context of

 race.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So simply making the

 selection or the transfer based on race or sex 

in and of itself becomes actionable?

 MS. BROWN: That is our position. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Nothing more? 

MS. BROWN: Yes, that's our position. 

We do think that when a transfer -- when an 

employment decision is made on the basis of a 

protected characteristic, that is the denial of 

equal treatment, and that's a harm that this 

Court has recognized in many cases, including 

Heckler versus Mathews, as my -- as my friend 

said. You know, Allen versus Wright makes the 

same point. There are other cases as well, but 

that we think is the only harm that the statute 

addresses.

 colloquy with -- with Justice Gorsuch, he was

 talking about whether someone could change the

 definition of the conditions of employment or

 the -- of the -- what -- the way the work or

 your -- your job was defined.  I think our 

position is that any kind of job assignment will 

necessarily qualify as a term, condition, or

 privilege of employment.  It doesn't have to be 

set out in the way that the job description is 

written. 

And so I think that -- that -- that we 

think that, you know, those -- it doesn't matter 

if the job assignment description is -- is 

altered because of discriminatory reasons.  What 

matters is whether this particular person was 

assigned new responsibilities based on a 

discriminatory basis.

 the only difference would be the color of the

 wall, but it could be, as the other -- as your

 colleague said, because one has a nice window 

and the other one doesn't, and I may think of 

that as de minimis.

 MS. BROWN: Sure.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  And 

some others might. So can you think of how we 

approach those situations?  The situations that 

intuit -- not the significant disadvantage one

understanding how courts are thinking that 

switching somebody from a day to a night job or 

a Monday-through-Friday job to a rotating 

week-long job where you're not getting any 

weekends off anymore is not a significant 

disadvantage, but we'll put aside the facts of 

this case. 

MS. BROWN: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we look at 

those sorts of things? 

MS. BROWN: So I think that, by

 anything like that on the basis of a protected

 characteristic, that is inherently harmful.

 That is -- that is discrimination against them

 in the terms, conditions, and privileges of 

employment, and I think that that is actionable.

 I understand that there might be cases

 where the specific employment action itself

 seems minor.  I think that those cases are 

perhaps a lot less likely to be brought, in part 

because of the -- the damages concerns that 

Justice Jackson was -- was pointing to. 

I think also in those cases, it's 

going to be harder for -- as -- as an 

evidentiary matter often for the employee to put 

forth sufficient evidence to show that there is 

a plausible inference that -- that the office 

assignment was made based on a protected 

characteristic, and so that is going to help, 

you know, get rid of a lot of these -- these 

kinds of claims on that basis as well. 

But what we think the inquiry should 

be focused on and what the statute certainly 

focuses the inquiry on is whether there is 

intentional discrimination, not on whether the

"injury" or "harm" or "worse off," I'm not 

exactly sure which ones you used, but those 

sorts of words, and we've used those sorts of 

words in several -- many of our opinions, but 

what you're saying is that those words do not 

have sort of any independent consequence, that 

once you can show the discrimination, you've 

shown the injury, you've shown the harm, you've 

shown the being worse off, that there's no extra 

thing. Is that -- am I reading you right? 

MS. BROWN: Yes, again, in -- in 

almost every situation.  Of course, we do 

recognize that there are some kind of 

distinctions that don't give rise -- that --

that they are generally viewed as innocuous, and

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what are you

 MS. BROWN: Bathrooms, there are some 

kinds of dress codes that, you know, are

 generally viewed as equal, but they recognize 

that men and women wear different clothes,

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your 

definition of a transfer? 

MS. BROWN: So we don't have a 

definition of a transfer.  The Court, you know, 

reformulated the -- the question presented to --

to focus specifically on transfers.  Nothing in 

our position changes based on how you view a 

transfer.  I think, you know, most courts or --

the kinds of transfers that -- that are 

generally addressed are, you know, a change in 

location, in responsibilities, in supervisors, 

things like that.

want to tell us what a transfer is?

 term that was introduced by the Court.  It's not 

a statutory term. But I think you could say,

 when there are -- and the D.C. Circuit doesn't

 interrupt.  How can we decide the case on that 

basis? Maybe it was unwise for the Court to 

phrase the question that way, but the -- the 

question is whether all transfers qualify.  So 

don't you have to provide a definition of a 

transfer? 

MS. BROWN: So I would say that it is 

something like what I was suggesting.  It's 

where the -- the employee's responsibilities, 

job location, or supervisor have changed.  I 

don't think it needs to be all three. 

So, for example, there's the Seventh 

Circuit's decision in -- in AutoZone, where an 

employee was transferred from one store to 

another on the basis of race.  The allegation 

there was that the employer wanted to maintain a 

predominantly Hispanic store, and so they moved

 that.

 The Seventh Circuit there held that 

that was insufficient under either Section

 703(a)(2) or (a)(1).  We think that's incorrect.

 We think that kind of a transfer would certainly

 qualify.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I -- now --

so you're saying a transfer is covered because 

there will always be changes in conditions or 

terms. Well, then a transfer itself is not 

enough.  You have to look at the conditions and 

terms. If it is from one place to another, it's 

a transfer, and if everything's the same, then, 

under your position, it wouldn't be covered, 

because you look at -- there must be new 

conditions, there must be terms. And, 

certainly, if there -- there are changes in 

conditions and terms, and that's -- many were 

documented or at least at the summary judgment 

stage in the Petitioner's brief. And that's a 

familiar inquiry and easy. 

But if you're -- you're saying that --

well, if you're saying that there always has to 

be a change in conditions and terms, that's one

is or is not so long as there's discrimination, 

it seems to me that's something different.

 MS. BROWN: So I -- there certainly 

does have to be a change in terms and conditions 

of employment. We think that anytime there's a

 transfer, there will necessarily be a change in

 terms and conditions of employment because I 

take a transfer to mean at least a change in 

location, and -- and we think the location is a 

part of your attendant -- the attendant 

circumstances that surround your employment. 

That's a part of your -- your working 

conditions. 

The Court has recognized in, you know, 

Meritor and Oncale and -- and Harris that 

working conditions are a part of what -- of --

of what is encompassed within terms and 

conditions of employment.  So I -- I think that, 

by necessity, a transfer is going to fall into 

-- into those categories.

helpful to say, "Not everything that happens in

 the workplace falls within Title VII"?

 MS. BROWN: Yes, I think that would be

 helpful, and it would be appropriate.  I agree

 with what the District of Columbia's brief said,

 that that phrasing has helped the -- the lower 

courts, the district courts, there have

 sufficient leeway to continue to dismiss claims 

that are not actionable, that maintains the kind 

of, you know --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  So then --

MS. BROWN: -- social interactions. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- what things that 

happen in the workplace don't qualify? 

MS. BROWN: So I think that that 

phrasing refers to things like informal 

workplace interactions, isolated incidents.  The 

Court in, you know, Harris, Oncale, Meritor has 

referred to things like offensive and 

distasteful jokes even if they are kind of, you 

know, sex discriminatory or racist in some ways,

that, for example.

are you trying to -- you don't want us to import

 that statement here -- I mean that standard 

here. It has to be severe and pervasive?

they're -- it's less likely that those are going

 threshold requirement for any other form of

 workplace discrimination?

 MS. BROWN: So the Court has explained 

that in the hostile work environment context,

 the question is whether there is a constructive

 alteration of the terms and conditions of

 employment, and so the -- the question is 

essentially whether the employer has effectively 

required you to submit to that harassing 

treatment as part of the working environment 

that you're in. 

And I think, you know, a background 

kind of lurking factor in those cases is also 

whether the conduct that you're speaking about 

there is attributable to the employer as an 

employer, and, you know, the employer is not 

always going to be responsible for everything 

that the -- the supervisor says. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  One last

Suppose you're talking to a district

 And you say, well, don't worry about 

that because, after discovery, you may be able

 after trial, the -- the damages aren't being --

 And, really, that's not an answer to

 my problem.  It's really helpful to me and 

consistent with what I think belongs in federal 

court, not what's moral and immoral but what 

belongs in federal court, to be able to dismiss 

these trivial cases at the outset as soon as I 

see the complaint. 

What do you say to that judge? 

MS. BROWN: So, even after Chambers in 

the D.C. Circuit, there have been cases that 

have been able to be dismissed on a motion to 

dismiss when there are conclusory allegations, 

when the facts pled still do not give rise to an 

inference of discrimination.  You know, you 

still do have to plead something that's going to 

help give rise to that inference of 

discrimination, whether that's a comparator in a

that's other conduct that suggests that these 

minor employment incidents are attributable to

 discrimination.

 And so there are -- there are cases,

 we've cited some in our brief, I think the

 District of Columbia in its amicus brief cites

 additional cases from the district where those

 cases have been able to be dismissed.  And, of 

course, discovery can be limited, motions for 

summary judgment are often granted. 

And I would also say that even in the 

transfer context now, when the courts have --

have required this kind of significant 

disadvantage requirement, you're always getting 

through or almost always getting through to 

summary judgment because courts have recognized 

that -- that at least in some instances, the 

change in position is significant -- is -- is 

sufficient, and so courts are -- are addressing 

those then too.

some of your discussions, a -- a lot of what you 

said tracks what the D.C. Circuit said in

 Chambers, and I just wonder, is there anything 

in that opinion with which you disagree?

 MS. BROWN: No, I don't think that

 there is. I -- I mean, I think they -- they set

 aside the question of whether there's a

 de minimis exception.  Of course, we think that

 the Court could -- could do the same here. Any 

transfer is necessarily going to be, we think, 

more than a de minimis injury. 

In our view, we think that there 

probably is no real de minimis exception here 

because of the significance of the -- the injury 

based on a protected characteristic, that that 

discrimination in and of itself it seems hard to 

characterize as trifling or insignificant or 

hardly worthy of notice. 

But -- but we think that, you know, 

the opinion by Judge Tatel and -- and Judge 

Ginsburg was a very good opinion and we -- we do 

agree with it.

thought the answer would be.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In -- in your

 colloquy with Justice Kagan, you briefly

 mentioned bathrooms and uniforms and suggested 

they might be okay, and I'm wondering how under 

your theory of the case.

 MS. BROWN: So I -- I think that there 

is this kind of narrow set of circumstances that 

I just referred to where there -- distinctions 

based on sex have kind of always been treated as 

innocuous, and I think those circumstances raise 

their own kind of special set of issues and 

there are cases that might arise within that 

context where you question whether the specific, 

you know, set of bathrooms or the grooming 

standards fall within that innocuous kind of 

characteristic and --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Innocuous by --

innocuous, do you mean non-injurious? 

MS. BROWN: Yes, exactly. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So you think there 

is an injury requirement here? 

MS. BROWN: Yes.  It's the injury that 

is inherent in unequal treatment in most 

circumstances.  In almost any circumstance, when

 and that this Court has recognized those.  Other 

courts have recognized those. The Court hasn't

 it would be --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- but I am asking 

for your help, so keep going. 

MS. BROWN: My sense is that -- that 

-- that the intuition behind the distinctions in 

those cases is that in the mine-run case, a 

gender-specific bathroom or a uniform is not 

going to give rise to the kinds of stigmatic or 

dignitary harms that we usually associate with 

unequal treatment on the basis of sex. 

I think that there are obviously 

distinctions or -- or there are cases when that 

won't be the case.  If the bathrooms are 

actually unequal, if the dress and grooming 

standards, you know, trade on sex stereotypes or 

are themselves, you know, more -- more difficult

 about harassment.  My understanding, and this 

matters, and some cases have been on, it's

 severe or pervasive.

cases that were decided in the D.C. Circuit 

after Chambers, the majority of the cases where 

summary judgment was at issue, the -- the -- the

that's based on whether there's sufficient 

evidence of -- of intentional discrimination at

I thought we had isolated the transfer

injury requirement in a whole host of other 

situations, to include the trivial or, you know,

transfers, and with respect to transfers, we

 hold, and I guess you would have us hold, that

transferred because of these protected

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So let's

 take -- Justice Sotomayor had that scenario as

 well.

 MS. BROWN: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let's take that. 

You have the office, and it's -- one is red and

 one is blue.  They're otherwise identical.  And 

the person, the boss, says, I think women should 

be in red offices.  So, I'm sorry, I know you 

picked the blue office in the -- as we went 

through, but I'm requiring that you sit in the 

red office because you're a woman. 

Is it the government's position that 

the woman would have to, in that scenario, not 

only prove that she was selected for this 

treatment because she was a woman but also that 

working in a red office significantly injured 

her? 

MS. BROWN: No. Our position is that 

the discrimination based on a protected 

characteristic is sufficient to show the harm 

that's required under the statute.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. LOEB

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. LOEB: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The language used in the statute 

doesn't say "discriminate between" or 

"discriminate with respect to."  It says 

"discriminate against," and that language, as 

used in Title VII, requires not just 

differential treatment but difference that 

injure the employee, specifically significant 

material objective harm. 

And reading Section 703(a)(1) to 

require harm is nothing new.  For example, more 

than 25 years ago in Oncale, this Court held 

that a plaintiff needs to show both that they 

were subject to disadvantageous conditions, they 

are harassing conditions, and that those adverse 

conditions were imposed based on a protected 

status.  And this Court went on to say the 

severity and the negative impact of the 

conditions must be looked at through an

 objective lens, not based on personal 

sensitivities, not based on personal 

preferences.

 That approach is fully consistent with 

that of the Eighth Circuit here and consistent 

with the approach adopted by pretty much all the 

circuits for the last at least 25 years.

 And reading "discriminate against" as 

requiring material objective harm is fully 

consistent with how this Court read that very 

same language in Section 704(a) in Burlington 

Northern as that Court looked to 7 -- 703(a)(1) 

precedent and the language of 703(a)(1). 

Moreover, reading "discriminate 

against" as requiring significant material harm 

is a piece with the specific examples provided 

in the statute.  Congress gave the initial 

examples of refusal to hire, firing an employee. 

Those are quintessential acts that are harmful 

to the plaintiff. 

A contextual principle that is 

embraced by this Court for a long time is that 

the Congress does not legislate as to trifles. 

So it's no surprise that this Court has 

consistently read Title VII not to speak to

 minor slights or personal preferences of the 

employee or job actions with no significant

 harm. As Justice Scalia emphasized in Oncale 

and as this Court reiterated in Burlington 

Northern, Title VII is not a civility code.

 Here, the Eighth Circuit properly held 

that the personal preferences for one assignment 

over another within the St. Louis police force,

 without more, cannot support the harm 

requirement of Title VII, and this Court should 

affirm that judgment. 

I welcome your questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  You say there --

there must be harm because of the addition of 

the preposition "against," "discriminate 

against."  But how do we quantify that harm? 

And if you are correct or if you think it's --

has to be a material harm, is there any 

difference between that and de minimis harm?  Or 

is it one side of the same -- different sides of 

the same coin? 

MR. LOEB: Yeah, the other side argues 

that it's unclear what the standard means.  It

administrable.  But the courts of appeals have

 far as if -- in the workforce.  Your

You know, it can be your hours of work. It can

 be the -- a significant different -- different

 functions of the job. It's not a high bar, but 

there needs to be something more than mere 

personal preferences and -- and subjective 

sensitivities of the particular employee. 

So it's a material objective harm. 

It's through the lens of an objective employee,

will be in terms of perception or -- or anything 

else, but it seems to be a certain violation of

 the statute. 

MR. LOEB: Yeah, I think, once you add

 into your hypothetical the overt discrimination, 

then you get into the hypothetical like Justice 

Kagan's water fountain example where by a

 protected status you're going to allow one group

 and -- and not another. And it could be an 

office. 

And then you would look at it as Judge 

Katsas said in the -- in his dissent in the 

Chambers case.  You'd look through the lens of 

the, you know, harassment, hostile workforce 

cases as to whether that statement by the 

employee that women -- you know, saying that 

they use -- need to use one bathroom or the 

other, that doesn't create stigma.  But saying I 

want all women to be over here and I want all 

men over there in certain circumstances can be 

stigmatizing.  For example, one of the 

hypotheticals, I'm going to give one protected 

status group just views of the alley and I'm 

going to give others not views of the alley.

you're having the same difficulty the other way

 as we had or at least I had before.  I'm just

 asking about no discernible harm.  And your 

answer is, well, there's a view of the alley,

 there's a view of this.

 MR. LOEB: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean --

MR. LOEB: Let me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- am I going 

to have the same problem with you, only from the 

different perspective? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LOEB: No, no, let me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because, I 

mean, you seem to be answering questions in 

which there's no harm apart from discrimination 

by saying, oh, there is harm. 

Now, if the harm is the discrimination 

itself, that's one thing.  Do you think that 

situation could arise? 

MR. LOEB: No, that -- that -- their 

argument conflates the intent and the harm 

requirement.  You don't just satisfy the harm 

requirement by saying:  But I think it was done 

to me because of my protected status.

What I'm suggesting is there are some

 cases where what the employee is -- saying

 something overtly, is -- as -- as -- as Justice

 Thomas said last -- in last term, that if you

 have a -- a stigmatizing segregation in the

 workforce, it's inherently going to be

 injurious.

 So it -- it's the stigma in certain

 circumstances which are based on the statements 

being made by the -- the employer --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, what if it's 

not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. No --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- what if it's 

not overt, though?  So it's proved that that's 

what's happened, but it was never said. So the 

discrimination, after you go through discovery, 

is proved.  This is what has happened.  The 

women -- the -- have to work in one place, the 

men in another.  Or the black employees are 

assigned to different offices.  It's never said, 

though, so you can't just funnel it into 

harassment.

is (a)(2) is about the effect and (a)(1) is

 about the intent of the employer to make this

 classification, which is why I'm resisting your

 suggestion that there is any harm requirement, 

as opposed to suggesting there is and perhaps it 

is being automatically satisfied. I am reject 

-- sort of resisting that (a)(1) is asking

 anybody about whether or not the discrimination 

in this situation is causing someone's harm. 

So can you -- can you do my 

hypothetical about women in red offices and men 

in blue offices?  The offices are otherwise 

identical, but we have a policy, whether orally 

stated or written or whatever, that women are in 

red offices.  So, if there was a woman who said, 

you know, I, for whatever reason -- well, that's 

the policy, women in red, men in blue, all 

right? 

Are you saying that in order to bring 

an actionable discrimination claim, a woman 

would have to say, I'm harmed by having worked 

in a -- a -- a -- a red office, and then it 

would have to be sort of material and objective 

and all of the other things that you bring in --

to your harm standard?

another element that the person has to show, and 

they have to show not just my boss said you're a

marshal evidence that I'm being harmed by being 

put in the red office because of my gender.

 distinction.  You're not -- you're not being

 allowed in that bathroom, but you're allowed in

 that bathroom.  But that doesn't --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Loeb, I

 think that that's not quite fair.  I mean,

 the -- the bathroom/grooming cases which first

 apply only in the cases of gender, but they're a 

really kind of discrete category.

 And the position that this side of the 

podium is taking is both simple and easy to 

understand in terms of Title VII's language, 

which is just to say that if there is 

discrimination, that counts as a harm. The 

discrimination is the harm save for these very 

few exceptional cases. 

Now what you are saying is, no, there 

has to be an additional showing of harm.  We 

recognize you say that harm doesn't really have

stigmatic harm in that. 

So now a court is going to have to, 

like, wander around going, well, how big is this 

harm and is it really stigmatizing or is it only 

a little bit stigmatizing.  And that sounds both 

like something that you don't want any court to

do and also something that the statute does not

 suggest.

 MR. LOEB: Well, it's the kind of 

analysis which is done all the time regarding

 conditions cases under (a)(1). The harassment

 cases are conditions cases, and the courts say 

not all conditions, even if based on a protected 

status, based on gender or race, even if it's

 based on that, the harassment is coming from --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But harassment is 

different and it's different because there 

hasn't been a direct -- an actual change in 

terms, privileges, or conditions.  You're doing 

the same job.  You have the same supervisor. 

You have the same hours.  You have the same 

everything. 

What we have said is, however, that 

constructively -- and that's how you have to 

figure this out -- there is a change because 

you're being subjected to something that might 

force you out of the workplace. 

Now that's a very different situation 

from -- from one where there's an actual change 

in terms and conditions. 

MR. LOEB: I -- I -- I -- we disagree

with that, Your Honor.  I think if you read --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know you want us

 to -- to disagree with it, but I don't see how 

you can get past the difference.

 MR. LOEB: Well -- well, let me -- let

 me -- let me walk you through the -- our -- our 

reading of Oncale, which is, I think, clearly

 the correct one.  So, if you -- this is Justice 

Scalia's unanimous opinion 25 years ago under 

703 elements.  In responding to the argument 

that the Court's approach was too broad, too 

liberal, at page 80, Justice Scalia holds that 

the challenged conduct must be because of a 

protected status. 

But then he goes on to say its 

separately hold that not all conditions imposed 

by a protected status will qualify, and he says 

that's because of Title VII's text referring to 

"discriminate against."  He says that text 

indicates that the statute only covers 

disadvantageous terms and conditions. 

So not all harassment that affects 

your conditions of employment and even minor 

harassment, you know, affects your conditions of 

employment.  It needs to be disadvantageous.

And, of course, then the Court went on to 

reaffirm the objective standard.

 They argued that there is no harm 

requirement, and subjective preferences, 

subjective sensitivities all will support an 

action, and that's not only contrary to Oncale,

 it's -- it's directly contrary to how this Court 

read the very same language "discriminate

 against" in Burlington Northern, examining the 

Section 703 precedent and saying you need 

material objective harm.  The same language and 

the same statute by the -- passed by the same 

Congress needs to be read the same way.

 they get the -- which -- is there a reason to

 treat those two women differently?

 MR. LOEB: I -- I -- I don't think so.

 Those kind of minor slights and grievances are

 what this Court in Burlington Northern warned, 

that if you open the door to those kind of 

lawsuits and had no meaningful threshold, the 

federal courts would become the super-personnel 

department not just for all private employers 

but for state governments and for local 

governments. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't know 

that the woman who -- who says that the boss is 

invariably nasty is -- is alleging something 

trivial, but what I'm asking about is the 

suggestion that any transfer from one office to 

another qualifies, but if it has to do with 

unpleasantness in the workplace, then anything 

goes. 

MR. LOEB: I mean, there are cases 

about transfer from one side of the -- of the 

office to the other, and the courts of appeals 

have all held and the district courts have held 

that that is not a material objective harm.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it's her

 preference, and let's say the supervisor --

so -- so let's say that she doesn't prove all of

 the other things that we're disputing and

She says, I really like this job

sorry, I prefer working with men. 

MR. LOEB: Then I think you would --

thanks for going back to that -- is you would 

have to exam that through the stigmatic lens and 

look at whether the statement there is labeling 

women as less than is creating a -- a -- a --

a -- a workforce where people are unequal and 

it's -- it's harmful just to work in that 

environment.

to look at the context of whether the 

responsibilities are different, whether the job 

change is disadvantageous to you viewed through 

an objective lens.  That's the standard that the 

courts of appeals have applied for 30 years, let 

me give you an example, and it's a well-tried 

and -- and -- and tested standard.

           Twenty-nine years ago, Justice

 Sotomayor, in the Williams versus R.H. Donnelley

 case, as a Second Circuit judge, rejected a 

transfer claim where the person said I prefer to 

work in the Las Vegas office as opposed to here. 

And the transfer wasn't granted.  The person 

said, well, this was being done on the basis of

 a protected category.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, that's --

that's -- that's it wasn't granted, so it's a 

little bit different than being forced to move 

there. But can I just ask you a question? 

You say whether it is the -- the --

the job change is objectively disadvantage --

disadvantageous, I think, is the standard that 

you're imposing.  I'm wondering whether or not 

that same standard is -- exists across all of 

the categories in sub 1. 

In other words, does a person who's 

fired have to also demonstrate that that firing 

was objectively disadvantageous, and could the 

employer defend on the grounds that you went on 

and you got a better job and, you know, it turns 

out this didn't hurt you at all? 

Is that -- is that -- is that the sort

 ambiguity about whether the "discriminate

 against" language applies to the first two

 listed items --

that "discriminate against" would be that 

different, right? 

MR. LOEB: Yeah -- yes, and I -- I 

think "discriminate against" is modifying those 

as well and -- and it should be read similarly.

let me try it this way, Mr. Loeb. Good to see 

you. 

I understand your point that Oncale 

and in Burlington Northern and elsewhere, we've 

said that "discriminate" means treat worse than, 

injure the plaintiff.  Got it. 

But I think we've also kind of 

indicated in our cases that when you treat 

someone worse than another person because of 

race or sex, that's kind of the end of it, and

we -- there isn't a further inquiry into how bad

 you -- how badly you treated somebody worse. A 

-- a minor treating worse on the basis of sex or 

race is something Congress in 1964 in a very

 short and sweet statute, 28 pages long but 

profound, said that the law will no longer

 tolerate.

 And once the courts get into the 

business of asking whether that injury is 

material or a reasonable person would be 

offended by it, that's a whole different extra 

textual layer that's going to weed out a bunch 

of claims based on a judge's sensibilities about 

how -- how bad is bad enough.  Thoughts? 

MR. LOEB: I -- I, you know, just 

strongly disagree with that.  As -- as Justice 

Scalia said, the language in the statute, the 

text itself, this is a textual argument, it says 

"discriminate against."  That requires that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm spotting you all 

of that, right?  I'm -- I'm spotting you all of 

that. "Discriminate against" means treating 

somebody worse.  That implies an injury.  But 

Congress could say that anytime you treat 

somebody worse because of their race or their

MR. LOEB: I think that --

on top of that, where do we get that in the

 statute, a material harm?  How do -- or an

 objective person or a reasonable person or

 whatever construct we come up with that's 

artificial, right, is going to weed out claims

 that Congress in 1964 thought profoundly 

important to include. 

MR. LOEB: You know, Congress also, as 

this Court has recognized repeatedly, was -- was 

trying to preserve management prerogatives and 

wasn't trying to open up the doors for every 

little action in the workplace to be brought. 

So there was a -- it was a -- a balanced 

approach. 

And this Court should not lightly 

presume, especially given the trifle principle, 

which Justice Katsas explained applies with full 

force here, should not lightly assume that 

Congress wanted to simply conflate the harm and 

the intent requirement where basically you're 

reading the language "discriminate against" out 

of the statute.  It could just say --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But isn't the -- the 

-- the trifle principle just inconsistent with

 the idea that -- the idea of stigmatic injury?

 I mean, we've recognized over and over again 

that discrimination itself can profoundly injure

 people, just the -- the fact itself that you're

 being treated differently from somebody else

 based on your race, based on your sex,

 et cetera.  I mean, so as to -- as to anything, 

as to pens, as to water fountains, as to 

anything. 

MR. LOEB: Yeah.  The stigma flows 

from the -- either the messaging from the 

employer saying I am going to give all people 

this protected status, views of the alley, 

that's what they deserve.  That's a stigma, 

right? We could -- that's -- this Court has 

recognized in the harassment cases and outside 

of it that stigma is a -- is a material harm and 

it can be enough.  You would look to it through 

an objective lens.  And -- and that is 

completely consistent with our opinion.  But 

that doesn't mean you just wipe away the harm 

requirement.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But doesn't -- oh,

 keep going.  Sorry.

 MR. LOEB: What work is the word -- is

 the words "discriminate against" doing if you

 take that view?  The statute says because of

 protected status.  It could say change of

 condition because of protected status.  You

 don't need the words "discriminate against."  If 

-- if you listen to their arguments, they are 

basically admitting that language has no force 

and is superfluous and is redundant. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, I thought it 

meant treat differently because of your race, 

let's say --

MR. LOEB: That's the latter --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- and -- and then

always assumed.  And then the question becomes, 

is -- does it relate to a term, condition, or 

privilege of employment? And not everything in 

the workplace will relate to a term, condition, 

or privilege of employment, but transfers, I 

think, clearly would.  And then, when you get

nonetheless justify why you're treating people

 differently.

 But the idea that you're treating 

people differently because of their race could 

not be a harm, not be discrimination, I don't --

I don't really understand that.

 MR. LOEB: Again, they could -- you --

you could just read the statute to either

 eliminate those words or to say discriminate 

between or with respect and not say against, and 

that last part of the statute, because a 

protected status would be doing all the work and 

you would just presume harm because you did it 

because of that. And the first part of the 

statute, the text -- that part of the text is 

just being ignored. 

And, look, where Congress wants to be 

more sweeping and to really root and branch, I 

think was, Justice Gorsuch, your language, they 

know how to do it. If you look at (e)(16) in 

the statute regarding the federal government, as 

opposed to all private employers and state and 

local employers, they use broader language.

 are -- is it your position that it could not 

have focused in on the action, meaning make 

unlawful a circumstance in which the employer 

treats someone differently because of their race 

or gender? Let's just take out the word 

"discrimination" for a second.

 Are you saying that there had to be, 

maybe as a matter of constitutional authority or 

something, a -- a -- a harm that Congress was 

capturing with this statute? 

MR. LOEB: I -- we think Congress 

could do that. The question is did they do that 

here. Did they mean to open up for federal 

lawsuits for minor actions where there's no 

significant harm --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, no. I'm 

just asking.  I -- so, if Congress had a value 

set that is similar to what others are focused 

on here in -- in which they thought that we are 

worried about employers that are treating people 

differently on the basis of these 

characteristics, we think that's a problem.

MR. LOEB: Yeah.  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now -- now stop. 

MR. LOEB: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just answer my 

question. 

MR. LOEB: She alleges all those 

things but didn't argue them at summary 

judgment.

 MR. LOEB: They certainly could be.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are -- what

 wouldn't make them material?  What objective

 facts would not make them material?

 MR. LOEB: You know, if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand 

your test, is what I'm saying. 

MR. LOEB: No, and -- and -- and the 

role --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's a change in 

the terms, conditions, and privileges of the two 

positions.  You're saying we have to overlay 

that with some sort of objective test.  Does 

that mean she has to prove that she has children 

at home at night or that she has to take care of 

her parents on the weekend?  Are we then 

individualizing the test to find out whether she 

was somehow injured more than in her personal 

preference?  I don't understand what you're 

saying.

Northern, this Court said you look at the -- the

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.  Briefly, 

Your Honor.  The -- I want to pick up where the 

discussion just left off, because I think 

Justice Sotomayor's question and some of the 

earlier questions on the topic of what one has 

to show under these material harm-type, 

objective tangible harm-type standards have been 

encapsulated by the D.C. Circuit's opinion in 

Chambers and I want to mention it. 

These cases, meaning these types of 

cases, asking the question whether something is 

harmful enough have consumed enormous judicial 

resources seeking to answer a question far

removed from the core Title VII inquiry whether

 an employer has discriminated against an 

employee based on a protected characteristic.

 I would add to that far removed is an

 understatement.  The -- the -- the -- the

 statute doesn't pose that question, and that's

 the problem.  But the -- the use of judicial

 resources is an important point.

 So opposing counsel has said the 

courts have been applying these standards for 30 

years. Some of the lower courts have, true, and 

the results are stunning. 

AutoZone, mentioned by the Assistant 

Solicitor General, the Hamilton case, the Threat 

case, where there's a policy based on the color 

of the officer's skin to quote Judge Sutton.  I 

point the Court to the amicus briefs that go 

through these cases in quite a good bit of 

detail. 

Just a few more points. 

As Justice Kavanaugh's question posed, 

the -- if the policy is covert until discovery, 

then it doesn't impose a stigmatic harm.  It 

imposes a purely dignitary harm. That too is 

actionable under Title VII.  And it becomes

stigmatic when it's uncloaked for all the world

 to see.  But, in either case, this -- the policy

 violates the statute.

 The gender cases that we've been 

discussing, the exceptions, the outlier cases do 

not help the City at all because every time you 

flip the scenario to race, religion, or national 

origin, the City loses. That shows those are

 outliers.  The City's position is a 

cross-cutting position, and it is wrong. 

Unless the Court has further 

questions?
