 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

I don't want to proceed as if I wasn't 

here for the first argument --

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: -- so let me focus on 

what's different about Texas.  One thing, 

fortunately, that's different -- that's 

different about Texas is its definition of 

"social media platforms" excludes websites.  So 

we can just put that Gmail issue to one side for 

when we're talking about Texas. 

The other thing it excludes, of 

course, is websites that are primarily focused 

on news, sports, and entertainment.  In the 

First -- Amendment business, we call that

 content-based discrimination, and that's just 

one of the many reasons that this statute is, 

dare I say it, facially unconstitutional.

 The other thing that's different is, 

in some respects, this statute operates more 

simply because it forbids my clients from

 engaging in viewpoint discrimination.  Now we're 

used to thinking that viewpoint discrimination 

is a bad thing and that governments shouldn't do 

it. And, of course, when governments do it, it 

is a bad thing. 

But, when editors or speakers engage 

in viewpoint discrimination, that is their First 

Amendment right.  It is also absolutely vital to 

the operation of these websites because, if you 

have to be viewpoint-neutral, that means that if 

you have materials that are involved in suicide 

prevention, you also have to have materials that 

advocate suicide promotion.  Or, if you have 

materials on your site that are pro-Semitic, 

then you have to let on materials onto your site 

that are anti-Semitic.  And that is a formula 

for making these websites very unpopular to both 

users and advertisers.  So it is absolutely 

vital.

The other thing that makes Texas a 

little different is, at least in passing the 

law, Texas was even more explicit in relying on 

the common carrier analogy, as if simply 

labeling websites common carriers makes the

 First Amendment -- problems go away.

 And that is fundamentally wrong for

 two basic reasons.  One, these companies don't 

operate actually as common carriers. They all 

have terms of use that exclude varying degrees 

of content.  And, second, Texas can't simply 

convert them into public common carriers by its 

say-so. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Clement, 

if these laws go into effect, what -- how would 

your clients -- what steps would they take to 

comply? 

MR. CLEMENT: So, I mean, you know, 

one thing that they would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Including --

I'm sorry -- just in -- in -- in particular, 

addressing the situation of compliance in Texas 

and Florida as opposed to nationwide. 

MR. CLEMENT: Sure.  So, I mean, you

know, one of the things that they would 

contemplate at least, you know, with respect to 

Texas in the first instance, is there some way

 to just withdraw from the market in Texas and 

Florida. And, of course, Texas had that in mind 

in the statute and specifically said by -- we --

we essentially have to do business in Texas, and

 we can't discriminate against users based on

 their geographic location in Texas. 

So, if we lose this, including, you 

know, the idea that we can be forced to engage 

in expressive activity in Texas, then I think we 

would fundamentally have to change the way that 

we provide our service in order to engage in 

view -- in -- in order to provide anything like 

the service that we want to, while not engaging 

in viewpoint discrimination, we'd basically have 

to eliminate certain areas of speech entirely. 

So we just couldn't talk about suicide 

prevention anymore because we're not going to 

talk about suicide promotion.  I guess we 

couldn't have pro-Semitic speech because we're 

not going to have anti-Semitic speech.  So we'd 

have to figure out some way to try to engage in 

even more content -- moderation or editorial

discretion to try to get us to a level where

 we're more benign and somehow we -- we don't run

 afoul of Texas's law.

 And then, on the disclosure 

provisions, the record here reflects that --

 that, you know, YouTube would have to basically 

increase its disclosure and appeal process

 basically a hundred-fold in order to comply with

 Texas law. 

I -- I mean, I'm happy to talk more 

about the common carrier issue because I do 

think it's a central part of their defense. 

There was an allusion earlier about somehow 

Section 230 treats -- treats my clients, the 

websites, as common carriers. To the contrary, 

Congress specifically -- and this is 47 U.S.C. 

223 subsection (6), which we cite in our 

briefs -- it specifically is a congressional 

provision in the same Act of Congress that says 

that interactive computer services should not be 

treated as common carriers. 

And I think, more broadly, the whole 

thrust of 230 is don't just be a common carrier. 

Don't just put through all of this material.  We 

don't want that.  We want you to exercise

the worst of the worst off the site. Now --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Does that, though,

 only with respect -- all that's true, and I -- I

 acknowledge all that, but it also says that's

 true only if it's not your speech.  And that 

seems to be in tension a bit with your

 suggestion that everything is your speech.  And 

I think Justice Barrett pointed out an 

interesting feature of that, which is these 

algorithms arrange, sort, promote certain --

certain posts by users and not others. 

And is that not your -- and I -- not 

yours -- but your clients' speech? 

MR. CLEMENT: So I don't think it's 

our speech in the way that Section 230 talks 

about the speech.  And I think, for these 

purposes, you have to distinguish between the 

speech that is the editorial function and the 

underlying user's speech. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I understand that, 

and I -- I -- I didn't mean to suggest 

otherwise.  But there is some editorial speech, 

your term, going on, right?

           JUSTICE GORSUCH: And so the -- the 

carrier would be liable for the -- its editorial

 speech?

 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so.  I

 mean, you know, I did actually reread the brief 

that I filed at least in the Gonzalez case, and 

I think that you could make a strong argument 

based on the text of that statute that that kind 

of editorial sort of functioning is not -- is --

is not something that causes you to lose your 

230 protection. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So it's speech for 

purposes of the First Amendment, your speech, 

your editorial control, but when we get to 

Section 230, your submission is that that isn't 

your speech? 

MR. CLEMENT: Yes, as a matter of 

statutory construction because, otherwise, 

Section 230 ends up being self-defeating 

because, again, the whole point of Section 230 

was to promote that editorial discretion. 

And this Court's -- you know, this 

Court wrestled with these issues.  They're hard 

issues.  And I -- I certainly applaud the

clients are engaged in editorial discretion when

a user is going to see when they tap into their

 MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely.  But this 

law is unconstitutional in all its applications

 and certainly in its -- it has no plainly 

legitimate sweep. So you don't have to reach

 the 230 question directly here.

 And I would simply say that when 

you're reading those statutory terms in 230, you 

wouldn't sweep in editorial discretion because, 

if you do, you will defeat the fundamental 

purpose of Section 230 --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What -- what do we 

do about --

MR. CLEMENT: -- which is to empower 

editorial discretion. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, I -- I just 

wanted to raise with you the question I raised 

with the -- with the Solicitor General, who 

offered a thoughtful response. 

But many of your clients' terms of 

service, while reserving some editorial 

discretion -- and I think about most of them as 

-- as -- as speaking about the things covered by 

230, obscenity, et cetera -- go out of their way 

to promise an open forum to all members of the

 endorse what other people say on this site and 

go out of their way to say all views shall

 flourish.

 Now that's not true for all of your 

clients, but it's true for some of them and many

 of them.  What do we do about that?

 MR. CLEMENT: So I would say that, you 

know, and it's true of some of my clients and 

some more than others, and I think all of those 

terms of service, as the General said, go on to 

say, and there are certain things, though, that 

are out of bounds. 

And I do think it's -- it's -- it's 

just a factually true thing that my clients in 

the main, as long as you kind of stay within the 

lines, they actually do want to promote a -- an 

open dialogue and a fair dialogue. 

And if you look at the Center For 

Growth and Opportunity brief, it shows you that 

actually, some conservative voices have really 

flourished on these websites.  Ben Shapiro and 

Daily Wire are killing it on Facebook.  And that 

shows you that, you know, we -- we do want a 

broad discussion, but there's some stuff that is

 And I don't think it's as simple to 

say, well, that's just the 230 stuff because,

 again, we had a debate about what "otherwise

 objectionable" means, but I also think that my 

clients are getting a lot of pressure to be 

particularly careful about things that are 

damaging to youths, and I think, in that

 context, they want -- to sort of err on the side 

of keeping some bad material off.  But --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, you've 

mentioned that a few times.  Let me just press 

the other way, though. 

Doesn't it also hold that on your 

view, part of the editorial discretion of a 

platform would be that it could use algorithms 

designed specifically to try to attract teens to 

addiction or suicide, depression, those kinds of 

things as well, that would be part of their 

editorial discretion too?

 your -- your position, isn't it?

 MR. CLEMENT: There -- there would be

 protected First Amendment activity with that

 very different website with a business model 

that I don't think would stay in business very 

long. And it is possible, as, you know, as the 

-- as the United States has pointed out in its 

brief, that if you have a different concern and 

you identify a different government interest, 

that maybe the government might be able to do 

something, particularly if it does it in a 

content-neutral way to address some of those 

concerns. 

But, to get back to something Justice 

Kavanaugh pointed out before, I mean, I actually 

think that both Texas and Florida have been 

pretty aggressive about their government 

interest here being something that is not just 

not a legitimate interest in the First Amendment 

context but is affirmatively prohibited, which 

is the idea that we're going to level the 

playing -- we're going to amplify some voices 

in -- we're going to make certain -- put burdens 

on private parties so that some voices can be

louder than others or some people can get a

 boost from what they're getting in the

 marketplace of ideas. 

And the only place this Court has ever 

allowed that was in Turner. And, I mean, 

Justice Kavanaugh, you pointed out that one of 

the key things there was content neutral. But I 

actually think the critical thing in Turner is 

that bottleneck or chokehold on the content that 

went into individual houses. 

And I think that's what made what was 

otherwise an impermissible government interest a 

legitimate government interest in that narrow 

context.  And maybe you could say the same 

thing -- I mean, I don't know if Red Lion is 

still good law -- but that's the same idea that 

there's like a scarcity rationale.  But there's 

no scarcity rationale on the Internet, and this 

course -- this Court said that in 1997 in the 

Reno case, where --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- I'm sorry. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, no. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can -- can I ask you 

about a distinction between two possible kinds 

of applications of the Texas law?

So one is the application that

 prevents you from keeping out certain speech

 that you want to keep out. You said

 anti-Semitic speech. It could be any of a

 number of things.

 As I understand it, the Texas law

 also -- prevents you also from doing something 

else, which is suppose you wanted to prevent

 anti-Semites from posting anything, you know, 

you want -- you just wanted to -- to say that 

they're a class of people we're not even going 

to let them post cat videos. 

Should we think about that set of 

applications differently? 

MR. CLEMENT: I don't think you should 

think of it radically differently.  I mean, it's 

a different application, but I think it's the 

same idea, which is there are some speakers --

and I think this is going to be, you know, very 

few -- but there are some speakers where they 

are so associated with a particular viewpoint 

that there -- it -- it informs essentially all 

of their speech. 

And it also affects the speech of 

other people in the forum.  If you have a white

posting there, it's going to cause a lot of

 other people to say:  What is that person doing?

 What's going on here?  Why are all the dog

 photos white?

 I mean, it's going to fundamentally

 change the dynamic on the website.  And I think

 a website that's trying to promote a particular

 discussion has a -- a First Amendment right to 

exclude those people.  And in practice, this is, 

you know, what -- what is used to exclude sort 

of, you know, sexual predators, which is 

something, again, that the government can't do, 

Packingham, but -- but Facebook does. 

And there are certain other people

viewpoint, the viewpoint is problematic, even if 

the particular post is not.

 And so, if you think about it as

 silencing someone who you let on your platform,

 then that seems more like speech or content 

moderation to the extreme, for example, but I 

assume that the implication of your answer to

 Justice Kagan is that you could tell the

 anti-Semite we're not open for business to you,

 right? 

MR. CLEMENT: You can tell that person 

that our speech forum is not open to you.  And I 

think that's what makes it different, that Texas 

is focused really on these speech-oriented 

platforms. 

And so I think, if you're in the 

business of speech and you have somebody -- and, 

again, this is not sort of other prohibited 

statuses.  This is viewpoint. And so you are a 

notorious anti-Semite, we do not want you to 

participate in this conversation.

 MR. CLEMENT: -- I want to preserve

 it's a private forum. And the government can't 

tell me as a private party let the Protestant 

into the Catholic party. I don't think so.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Clement, can I ask

 you about Section 2? I don't think anything has 

been said about it so far. 

So you say that Section 2's 

individualized explanation requirements violate 

the First Amendment because they impose a 

massive burden, right?  That's your argument? 

I mean, I -- it seems to me that the 

European Union has imposed exactly the same --

pretty much the same individualized explanation 

requirement on anybody who operates there that 

Texas has imposed.  And I -- I'm not saying that 

whatever the European Union says is okay is 

constitutional here, but just on the practical 

question of whether it's too much of a burden, 

if it's not too much of a burden for your 

clients to do it in Europe, how can it be too 

much of a burden for them to do it here?

MR. CLEMENT: So, as I understand the

 requirements, they are different.  They are

 materially different.  This, you know, the --

and -- and in a sense, the European Union

 provision has sort of a built-in kind of, you

 know, reasonably practical provision right into 

what you have to do. You only have to do what's

 reasonably practical.

 This is an absolute requirement to 

respond to every -- you know, every takedown, 

and that's over a billion takedowns of comments 

in a quarter for YouTube. And then there's also 

this appeal process, which I don't think is 

coextensive with the process in Europe. 

So just as a practical matter, I think 

this is more burdensome. But, as you said, the 

First Amendment does not apply in Europe.  And I 

think that having this kind of disclosure 

requirement on what is really an editorial 

discretion decision is potentially, I mean, 

hugely problematic. 

I mean, if you took this and said, you 

know, The New York Times, you have to -- you 

have to tell us why you rejected my -- my

content that appears in every single one of the

 videos on YouTube that you -- you allow to be

 included, you would be liable potentially for 

the content of those -- that material.  And --

and I don't understand the rationale for 230 if 

it wasn't that you can't be held responsible for 

that because this is really not your message. 

Either it's your message or it's not 

your message. I don't understand how it can be 

both. It's your -- it's your message when you 

want to escape state regulation, but it's not 

your message when you want to escape liability 

under state tort law. 

MR. CLEMENT: So I don't really think 

we're being inconsistent, and what I would -- I 

would try to draw the analogy just to a good 

old-fashioned anthology.  If I put together an 

anthology of 20 short stories, everybody 

understands that the underlying short stories

are still the product of the -- of -- of the

 individual author, but as the anthologist, as 

the editor of this compilation, who decided 

which 20 got in, which ones didn't, I'm

 responsible for those editorial discussions,

 those decisions.  Those are both protected First

 Amendment decisions.  You can distinguish 

between the underlying material and the

 editorial decisions. 

Now, at common law, the publisher was 

responsible for both, and so they were still 

liable for what the -- the republishing the 

authors' work.  And that's precisely what 

Congress wanted to get rid of in 230, and they 

wanted to essentially give our clients an 

incentive to weed out of the anthologies the 

stuff that was harmful for children and 

problematic. 

And that's why I don't think it works 

to say, oh, well, then that's your speech, so 

you're liable under 230, because it's that 

editorial control, the weeding out the bad 

stuff, that was the whole point of 230, to 

empower that.

written material was considered to be obscene,

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, we exercised 

editorial discretion.  That doesn't shield you 

from liability. 

MR. CLEMENT: Not at common law, and 

that's why Congress had to come in with 230. 

But what Congress did is it looked at the common 

law and it said, oh, this is problematic, 

because the only way you can avoid liability at 

common law is if you act as a conduit and let 

everything out.  And once you start keeping out 

a little bit of porn, then you're responsible 

for the porn that slips through. And that's not

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  I don't

 want to -- I -- I don't want to belabor the 

point. Let me just say something about the 

analogies that both sides draw to the issues 

that were presented in prior cases.

 So you say this is just like a

 newspaper basically.  It's like the Miami 

Herald. And the states say no, this is like 

Western Union. It's like a telegraph company. 

And I -- I think -- I look at this and 

I say it's really not like either of those. 

It's worlds away from -- from both of those. 

It's nothing like a newspaper.  A newspaper has 

space limitations.  No matter how powerful it 

is, it doesn't necessarily have the same power 

as -- as some of your clients.  But put that 

aside. 

Newspapers overtly send messages. 

They typically have an editorial.  They may have 

an editorial 365 days a year or more than one. 

But that's not the situation with even the most 

prominent of your clients.  So I -- I don't know 

how we could decide this case by saying -- by 

jumping to one side or the other of this case

law.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let

 me offer two thoughts.  One, this isn't the

 first time you're wrestling with the Internet. 

You wrestled with it in Reno. You wrestled with

 it last term in 303 Creative.  And I think the 

gist of those cases is this is more like the 

newspaper or the parade organizer than it is

 like a common carrier. 

And then, as to the cases, whether you 

think that this is different from a newspaper, I 

mean, the arguments that you're pointing to to 

say this is different are the arguments that 

those cases wrestled with and said didn't 

matter. 

So I know you know this, but in 

Tornillo, it -- you know, there was all this 

language about it being a monopolist, and that 

was in the context of a local political election 

where, if you couldn't get into the Miami 

Herald, like, where else were you going to go? 

And yet this Court said that didn't matter. And 

the -- the -- also, in Tornillo, this Court 

said, yes, space constraints, there are some, 

but our decision doesn't turn on that.  And

then, in Hurley, there's a lot of language in

 the -- in the Court's opinion that says, you 

know, this is not like much of a message and 

they let some people show up even if they get 

there, like, the day of, and the only thing

 they're doing is, like, excluding this group.

 But, of course, the exclusion was the 

message that they were sending, and it's the

 message the state was trying to prohibit.  And 

that's kind of the same thing here, which is --

much would it weigh?

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, it would

amount, which is why, in order to make it 

useful, there's actually more editorial 

discretion going on in these cases than any of

focus on the -- on the users that get knocked 

off entirely and end up on the cutting room

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because it is a

 facial challenge.

 MR. CLEMENT: It -- it -- it is a

 facial challenge.  It is a preliminary

 injunction.  We've obviously been over some of

 that. There -- this -- here, there was -- you

 know, there wasn't just declarations.  There

 were depositions taken. There was a record that 

was put together on all of this. And Texas was 

taking a slightly different view of what the 

burdens of the -- of Section 2 were there. 

And so I think, on -- on that, if you 

just look at the record that was before the 

district court, you should affirm the district 

court's preliminary injunction. 

What I would say, though, is I also 

think that even -- even what they say on page 44 

of their red brief is that, you know, you can do 

this in a relatively less burdensome way as long 

as your editorial policies are sufficiently 

specific and particularized. 

And what -- what they're basically 

saying is, you know, you could change your 

editorial policies a little bit to make it 

easier to comply with this disclosure

So part of the dynamic that I think is 

going on in these cases is the fact that this 

regulation is enacted by the sort of 

democratically elected representatives of a 

state, and I suppose that if the state's 

regulation of these platforms gets too 

burdensome, then, presumably, the platforms can 

say forget it, we're not going to operate in 

your state.  And then the citizens of the state 

would have the chance to determine if that's 

what they really wanted.  That's sort of how I'm

 looking at this at a -- at a meta level.

 So what caught my attention was your

 response to the Chief Justice when you suggested

 that your client couldn't withdraw from the 

State of Texas because you read the provision

 related to censorship and geography as ensuring

 that you don't do so. I had not read that

 provision in that way, so can you say more about

 why that's your interpretation? 

MR. CLEMENT: Sure.  I think that's 

the obvious interpretation of that provision, 

particularly when it talks about -- you know, 

this isn't -- this isn't like, you know, don't 

-- don't discriminate against Texans or Texans 

wherever they are.  The fact that it's 

particularly preventing us from discriminating 

on somebody with a geographic location in Texas 

is basically telling us that we can't try to 

geofence our service and try to essentially, you 

know, explain to the people -- you know, 

sometimes, like, if you get -- like, your cable 

service has a dispute with a provider and you 

can't get your football game and they tell you, 

if you're hacked off about this, you know, call 

this number and complain.

We can't do that in response to this

 law. And I think the legislators in Texas were

 able to tell their constituents, don't worry, 

you know, if you like your website, you can keep

 it. We're not going to threaten -- they

 can't -- they can't pull out of here based on 

the way that we're regulating them.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, even if we could 

read it a different way, you're saying this --

this necessarily -- I mean, I guess this also 

dovetails with my concern about us not having 

sort of state interpretations or an application 

here to really understand, because I could read 

this differently. 

It seems to me it's fitting into the 

whole set of things you're not allowed to do. 

You can't censor people on the basis of the 

viewpoint of the user. You can't censor them 

basis -- on the basis of the viewpoint that is 

being expressed and you can't censor them based 

on their location in your state or another part 

of the state. 

And so I guess I don't necessarily see 

that in the same way. I mean, you can't just 

automatically do that, I guess.  I don't know.

MR. CLEMENT: It -- it -- it -- it 

seems to me quite clear that it's designed 

essentially as a poison pill or somebody

 described it as the Hotel California provision,

 that you can -- you can -- you can -- you can't 

leave Texas even if you want to try to do that 

as a way of showing that this is an 

impermissible way of regulating our expressive

 activities. 

And, you -- you know, so -- so I -- I 

-- I do think that is the right reading.  I do 

think the fact that it's -- geographical 

location in Texas is kind of a clue to that.  So 

this is not something where, you know, if you're 

a -- you know, if you're a Texas fan, you're 

protected no matter where you go in America. 

This really is designed to sort of say that you 

can't do the kind of geofencing that you might 

otherwise do to comply with an idiosyncratic 

state law. 

I should mention just for the sake of 

completeness that, you know, in the lower 

courts, not part of the preliminary injunction, 

there are dormant commerce clause challenges to 

these provisions and the way that this is just

I want to pick up with the question 

that Justice Alito asked in the seriatim round 

to my friend about the idea that the social

 media platforms don't perfectly fit into either 

analogy or paradigm here, and I want to 

acknowledge the force of that intuition.

 They obviously operate at a massive 

scale that goes beyond any particular parade or

 beyond any particular newspaper. I think the 

right thing to do with that intuition is to 

recognize that it's not like you can just exempt 

them from the First Amendment. 

They are obviously creating something 

that's inherently expressive in taking all of 

this quantity of speech on their websites and 

curating it and making selectivity decisions and 

compiling it into a product that users are going 

to consume. 

So the First Amendment applies, but I 

think that those kinds of concerns about how the 

social media platforms and how they look 

somewhat different from the other kinds of 

expressive products this Court has reviewed in 

prior cases can come in to the question of 

whether the First Amendment is satisfied with

 respect to any particular regulation.

 Now, here, we think it's not satisfied 

because of the way that Texas has designed this

 law. I'd urge the Court to rule narrowly.  It's 

not necessary here to try to figure out how the

 First Amendment applies to new technology in 

general or to every possible website or the 

Internet in particular. This law has a very

 clear defect. 

What Texas has done is tried to 

countermand the protected editorial speech 

decisions of the platform and the only 

justification it's offered to the courts below 

is that it wanted to essentially amplify the 

voice of users on that platform by suppressing 

the platform's own protected speech.  That is a 

defect that is clear under the First Amendment, 

and the Court could say only that and resolve 

this case. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

 How would you respond to that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So let me respond 

to that by saying I think the position we're 

offering here and the position this Court will 

consider next month in the Murthy case are 

entirely consistent. 

We, of course, acknowledge that if the 

government actually coerces the platforms and 

takes over their editorial decision-making, then 

the platforms could be deemed a state actor and 

that would be subject to First Amendment 

scrutiny. 

We vigorously dispute that that has 

actually happened and the federal government has 

engaged in that kind of coercive conduct and we 

further dispute the legal standards that were 

applied in that case.

But there's no inherent tension here.

 You know, the federal government obviously can 

act and criticize the social media platforms'

 content moderation decisions.  That's just using 

the bully pulpit to express views.

 And if -- if the states disagreed with 

how the platforms were exercising their content 

moderation standards, it could have done the

 same. It could have criticized them, it could 

have urged them or tried to influence them to 

adopt separate standards.  But, here, what the 

State did is said, we're going to pass a law 

that actually takes over their content 

moderation and dictates that it has to be done 

in a different way. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, Texas's law 

even more than Florida's can be understood as an 

expansion of public accommodations laws.  And 

the United States is often in a position of 

defending public accommodations laws and 

insisting that they be vigorously enforced.  And 

how do you see what Texas is trying to do as 

consistent with that broader stance about public 

accommodations laws?

be very clear and stake out potentially some 

separate ground from my friend representing the 

platforms in this case with respect to generally

 applicable public accommodations laws that

 protect based on a -- a -- a particular status.

 We think, of course, those laws are 

valid on their face and that they serve

 compelling governmental interests.  And so, to 

the extent that you're looking at how an 

ordinary public accommodations law operates, the 

refusal to deal, the refusal to serve, as 

Justice Barrett said, we think that's a 

regulation of conduct and that ordinarily there 

would be no First Amendment problem with the 

application of that law. 

Now I acknowledge that it gets more 

complicated when those laws are applied to a 

business that is providing an expressive 

product, and cases like Hurley or 303 Creative 

show that in certain applications, sometimes the 

public accommodations law has to give way to 

First Amendment interests. 

But I think the -- the Court has drawn 

a clear line.  It has never suggested that the 

mere refusal to deal or serve based on status,

even with respect to an expressive association,

 would fail under First Amendment scrutiny.

 Instead, you know, you look at a case 

like 303 Creative and, there, the concern was 

about changing the message or a case like 

Hurley, gay and lesbian individuals could march, 

you just couldn't change the message by holding

 up a particular sign.  So we recognize that

 there are going to be some applications where 

you'd have to conduct that kind of First 

Amendment analysis.  But, if the question, the 

relevant question, is could you just bar people 

on the basis of a protected status from creating 

an account and it's not going to affect your 

message, they want to, you know, lurk on X and 

read other people's posts, I think that that 

kind of law would certainly be valid. 

I want to briefly address, Justice 

Gorsuch, the question you asked about the scope 

of CDA preemption under Section 230.  Just to be 

clear on this one, I -- I want to say there are 

unresolved issues here.  I would warn the Court 

away from trying to resolve exactly how much 

conduct CDA 230 protects and exactly how that 

interacts with the Texas law here.

The only point I would make is that,

 you know, there are -- there are questions about 

what it means to act in good faith, questions 

about what it means for the platform to take

 down content that -- that is otherwise

 objectionable.

 But however those interpretive 

disputes might shake out in a particular case, 

surely, Texas here isn't saying that its entire 

law is preempted and it has no effect whatsoever 

and CDA 230 fully takes care of the problem. 

So I think what the Court could do, 

not knowing exactly the scope of how that 

preemption issue might be resolved, is to say 

whatever exists in that category of speech that 

Texas is prohibiting, the editorial decisions 

it's countermanding on the one hand versus what 

CDA 230 would authorize on the other hand, 

whether that's a big category or a little 

category, all of the things in that category 

constitute protected decisions by the platform 

that haven't been adequately justified.  And I 

think that's all you need to say about the 

preemption issue in this case.

 some area and it does so because it has -- it is

 concerned that people who express a particular

 viewpoint are suffering discrimination, is that 

law unconstitutional on the ground that the

 particular group?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, I don't think

 distinctions?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Internet service 

providers are fundamentally different because 

they are engaged in transmitting data in order 

to make websites accessible, and that is not

 inherently expressive.

           They're certainly providing the -- the 

infrastructure, the cable, the fiberoptics, and 

the service to make sure that you can log in on 

your home computer and access the Internet writ 

large, but along the way, they're not compiling 

that speech into any kind of expressive 

compilation of their own.  So we would put them 

in the same category as telephone and telegraph 

companies or UPS, where you could say, sure, 

they're literally facilitating the transmission 

of speech, but they're not creating an 

expressive product that could implicate the 

First Amendment principles at stake. 

Now then you might ask, okay, well, 

what if they want to start discriminating with 

respect to the service they're providing for 

particular types of websites?  The kind of 

quintessential example of this is an Internet 

service provider that decides to slow down

because it wants to direct Internet traffic to

 some other website of its own choosing, maybe

 its own streaming service.  We think net 

neutrality could come in there and -- and say 

you're not allowed to discriminate based on 

content in that way, but that's because, again, 

there would be no expressive speech or -- or 

compilation that you could attribute to the 

Internet service provider itself. 

People don't sign up with Comcast or 

Verizon to give them some kind of limited, 

curated access to the Internet.  They're 

engaging in service with those companies because 

they need someone physically to transmit the 

data so they can get access to the whole

This is not the first time that new 

technology has been used to stifle speech.

 Telegraphs also discriminated based on 

viewpoint, prompting a national -- a national

 scandal.  Yet, under the platforms' theory,

 Western Union was just making editorial choices

 not to transmit pro-union views.

 Today, millions of Americans don't 

visit friends or family or even go to work 

online -- on person.  Everybody is online.  The 

modern public square.  Yet, if platforms that 

passively host the speech of billions of people 

are themselves the speakers and can 

discriminate, there will be no public square to 

speak of. 

We know this because Twitter has 

admitted that their theory of the First 

Amendment would allow them to discriminate not 

just based on what is said on the platform but 

"on the basis of religion or gender or physical 

disability." 

That's not the First Amendment. 

That's Lochner 2.0.  And as more than 40 states 

warned the Court, the implications are gravely 

serious.  For example, as New York explains, if

 these algorithms are constitutionally protected,

 platforms may be able to continue selling 

advertisers the ability to discriminate based on

 race. Or, as Professor Lawrence Lessig, Zephyr

 Teachout, and Tim Wu, who do not typically file

 briefs in support of Texas, cautioned, not just 

states but Congress may be powerless to address 

the social media crisis devastating the lives of

 kids. 

HB 20 is a modest effort to regulate 

such power in the context of viewpoint 

discrimination.  Platforms can say anything they 

want under HB 20 about anything.  There's no 

limit. They can say anything they want.  Users 

can block anything they don't want.  There's no 

limit on that. All that's left is voluntary 

communications between people who want to speak 

and people who want to listen. 

This law is just nowhere near the 

heartland of the First Amendment.  Instead, this 

is democracy and federalism, not a facial 

pre-enforcement injunction. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

act as Texas has? And it appears Mr. Clement 

suggests that actually Congress has acted in the

 opposite direction.  Would you comment on that?

 MR. NIELSON: Yeah.  I don't see

 how -- with all respect to my friend, how their 

reading of 230 is at all consistent with what

 Congress said.  They have all sorts of kind of 

policy arguments about how 230 ought to work, 

but if you actually just read the words of the 

statute, it doesn't work. 

So his suggestion that Congress 

somehow has kicked out Texas or said that that's 

not how he wants to be I don't think is 

consistent with the text of the statute.  I 

didn't hear a lot of textual argument coming 

from Mr. Clement there. So that would be my --

my first-line answer. 

My second-line answer is I have no 

idea why Congress does or does not do, but I do 

know that Texas has the ability to protect 

Texans, and that's what Texas has done here.

 Well, the First Amendment doesn't

 apply to them.  The First Amendment restricts 

what the government can do, and what the 

government's doing here is saying you must do 

this, you must carry these people; you've got to 

explain if you don't. That's not the First

 Amendment. 

MR. NIELSON: Well, respectfully, Your 

Honor, the First Amendment is big and it applies 

in a lot of different ways.  So it's true, for 

us, like, we're saying because this isn't 

speech, it's conduct, we can require viewpoint 

neutrality. 

But, in other cases, the same 

companies are saying -- when New York or some 

other state says, hey, you can't have algorithms 

that try to hook kids, they say, well, we have a 

First Amendment right to do that.  It's the same 

First Amendment, the same First Amendment that 

says -- I mean, if it's all First Amendment, 

then I guess it's going to be hard for Texas to 

say you -- you have to be viewpoint-neutral, but 

it's also going to be hard for California and

Illinois or anybody else to say you can't have 

an algorithm that hooks kids because it's all 

the same First Amendment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, I'm sure

 it's the same for all the other -- the other

 states.  The question is they don't have the

 obligation to act in the same way that you as

 the state has the obligation to do.

 They can discriminate against 

particular groups that they don't like, whether 

it's a group that encourages kids to take the 

Tide POD contest or something else.  And you 

have different obligations. 

MR. NIELSON: I -- I guess a couple 

ways I could respond to that, Your Honor.  The 

-- the easiest one I'm going to talk about is, 

if I may, common carriage.  My reaction coming 

to this case was the same as yours.  My reaction 

was: Well, wait a minute, it's their own 

platform.  You can't censor.  Like, they're --

they're private. 

But that's the exact same scenario 

that came up with the telegraph. The idea the 

telegraph was dumb pipes is not true.  Instead, 

what the telegraph was, they had the technologic

 going to let this type of speech through.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you're 

absolutely right, but it's kind of begging the 

question. You're assuming that they are like 

the telegraph. It seems to me that that's a big 

part of what the case -- case concerns.

 And I'm just not sure that -- I mean, 

the telegraph had a particular compelling type 

of monopoly.  I mean, if you didn't want to use 

the telegraph that was there, you usually didn't 

have an alternative choice, or whether you're 

talking about railroads or other types of common 

carriers, I'm not sure the same thing applies 

with respect to social platforms. 

MR. NIELSON: So I give you my theory 

for why common carriage is important here.  As I 

look at the cases, and I agree, they're really 

hard to figure out where conduct starts and 

speech ends and all of that, and you look at all 

the various cases this Court has said, some 

commentators say they can't be reconciled.  I'm 

not sure about that. 

But I think as a helpful way to think 

about it is we know that there is a line between

carriage has always been on the non-speech side 

of the line, the conduct side of the line.  So, 

if this falls within the common law tradition of 

what is common carriage, nobody has ever thought

 that falls on the speech side of the line.  So

 we -- we can't make them, you know, say

 something otherwise that they -- that they

The whole point of it is that's a

it's important, I said, to go back to look at 

the history on this, because, at some point, the 

First Amendment has to end, or everything is 

covered by the First Amendment.

 This Court has said that the way that 

we tell the difference is whether it's 

inherently expressive. And the Court has said

 what they mean by "inherently expressive."  They 

talked about in, you know, Miami Herald, you're 

not a passive conduit.  We talked about in 

Hurley whether you're intimately connected. 

Well, this Court last year had a case 

in Taamneh where they talked about what these 

platforms do, and they say that they are 

passively connected to the speech on their 

platforms and that they're agnostic about the 

content.  It's just one big algorithm that's 

matching things together. 

And I think that that's important. 

But I also want to stress, if I may, again, this 

is a facial posture.  And if you look at the 

breadth of our statute, there is the talk about, 

you know, whether you have to host somebody's 

speech.  There's also about you just want to 

read Facebook. That is one of the provisions of

 You go online in the morning and you

 from doing that too.

 And that's surely public accommodation

 law. The idea that somebody -- they don't like 

somebody because of their race or their

 disability or something like that, and we're 

going to say we're not going to allow you onto 

our platform, that surely cannot be 

constitutional.  That's what I mean by that's 

Lochner. 

That's you've gone beyond any content 

of this platforms themselves on their page to 

saying we're not going to let people even look 

at what we're selling.  That's a bookstore 

saying we won't sell you our book.  That's

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What would they look

 like?

 MR. NIELSON: So the one that comes to

 mind would be imagine -- and this comes up in --

in their brief -- they picked, like, the most

 vile example and they say: Imagine a publisher 

didn't want to publish the book written by the

 Proud Boys, was the example that they used. 

I think you might very well have an 

as-applied challenge to that, but the problem 

for them is they picked the most vile example 

when I think all of them would say: Well, wait 

a minute, you -- surely, you can let them on 

Facebook and you can't kick them off because 

their grandma said something outrageous, right? 

So there's got to be a limit there. 

And that's why a facial resolution of this case 

doesn't work.  And if it is, you can't fix a --

separate the one from the other? Where is the

hard to know when something becomes inherently 

expressive. And the Court's cases like Dale,

 about when does something that happen, all of

 those are hard cases.

 But, in all of them, this Court has

 had facts.  They've actually looked at the facts 

of the case and tried to figure out as applied 

whether that makes sense here.

 In this situation, there's a million 

applications of this law that are perfectly 

fine. And they pick some of the most vile 

possible hypotheticals, ignoring, by the way, 

the provision of Texas law which they never 

addressed, which says, under Texas law, if you 

don't want to hear content, they are allowed to 

make sure you never hear that content. 

So all you have left -- I mean, again, 

they -- they never mention at all, that's like 

the focus point of our brief, they never respond 

to it. But that means all that's left is I 

don't want to hear this type of speech.  I just 

want to hear this type of speech.  And it's just 

-- voluntary communication. That's a telephone.

of conversation about how broad Florida's law

 was. I read Texas's law to be more narrow in 

its coverage, that it wouldn't sweep in some of

 the examples we were using in the last argument

 like Uber, Etsy.  Is that -- am I correct?

does Texas's law cover? Am I right that it 

covers only the classic social media platforms 

like YouTube, Facebook?

sure that was covered is Facebook, Twitter, and 

YouTube.

 their speech is identical to the speech of

 somebody else, their theory is:  Well, we can

 kick you off. 

That seems to be pretty far into the 

world of public accommodations, like, you know, 

303 was a narrow case. If that's what 303 

means, like, boy, now we're really, really, 

really big, you know, hence, Digital Lochner or 

Lochner 2.0, the idea that everything can't be 

protected by the First Amendment.  At some 

point, there's lines of content.

 difficulty geofencing Texas or Florida.  Can you

 address some of those concerns?

 MR. NIELSON: Yes.  Two answers if I

 may? First, there is some suggestion that the

 prohibition on discrimination against Texas or a 

part of Texas is somehow a trap to keep -- keep

 companies in.  That's not true.

 If you read the statute, that's not 

what it says. There's a separate provision in 

the statute which is the jurisdictional hook, 

which is, you know, if you're doing business in 

Texas -- and, by the way, even if Texas tried to 

do that, there's something called personal 

jurisdiction that you can simply just leave a --

a forum.  That's this Court's decision in Ford. 

So that argument, it's just not true. 

But the other part that I think is really 

important about this is Texas's law, what is the 

remedy here?  It's an injunction.  There's no 

damages here.  It's an injunction. 

And, in fact, we know that it's not 

going to flood the courts because the injunction 

against the attorney general is limited to the 

attorney general.  There's private enforcement 

of Section 7.

And we have a handful of cases because

 you don't get damages. So it's hard unless you 

have a really darn good case to be able to go to 

court if nobody's going to get damages for 

prevailing, which I think -- matters a lot in

 terms of, like, what are the real-world

 consequences here?

 They're going to have some lawsuits by

 the attorney general for injunctions.  And if we 

can't prove it, if we can't prove viewpoint 

discrimination, they will prevail. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Did you say they 

could stop doing business in Texas under this 

law? 

MR. NIELSON: Yes, Your Honor, of

personal jurisdiction.  Anybody can get out of

 Facebook?  I mean, if somebody -- or emailed and

 all that.  If they send something into Texas, 

are they doing business in Texas?

 MR. NIELSON: No, Your Honor, though

 that would be a fun personal jurisdiction case.

 The answer as I understand it is you have to

 purposely avail yourself of the forum.  So 

merely because somebody can look at your 

website, if you're not having some purposeful 

direction towards the forum, that's generally 

not sufficient. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, 

these -- it's a worldwide sort of thing and 

people are going to be sending stuff left and 

right and you know that as -- as the -- as the 

company.  I'm not sure -- I don't see how they 

can wall off Texas from the activities of the 

social media platform. 

MR. NIELSON: Well, I mean, two 

answers.  One, they can.  They have the 

technological ability.  It's called geofencing, 

which they can carve off.  I mean, if they 

wanted to, they can probably carve off this 

building itself.  They have the ability all the 

way down to that granular level.

 relationship between the two.  So they have

 customers that are in these places.  And people 

say, well, they don't have any customers because

 they're not charging any money.  Well, we know 

that if they're not charging any money, like,

So they're taking your data and 

they're selling it to the advertisers, which is 

why it's so important that we recognize that if 

this algorithm is protected by the Constitution,

 a terrorist's speech?  How is that handled?

 MR. NIELSON: Yeah.  So a few ways. 

The first response that I would have to that is 

the provision of the statute that they ignore,

we're -- now we're -- most of the universe is 

gone, but the next level of this, under Texas 

law, if it's illegal, they don't have to do that 

either.  So I'm assuming that a lot of the

 And then the last point, this is at

 voluntary people wanting to talk each other.

 Maybe it'll persuade you.  Maybe it won't.  I 

came around on this to say this is something 

further up the food chain than that ordinary

 level of political discourse.  This is just the 

type of infrastructure necessary to have any 

kind of discourse at all. That's why I keep

 going back to the telegraph.

 This isn't, you know, the self -- the

 level of discourse where they're making the 

content decisions that we make our decisions 

based on. This is the infrastructure that we 

need to have any sort of discourse at all. 

So, if we say we want to have that 

type of infrastructure not have, you know, 

censorship on it, that would mean we would have 

to have a rapid -- a massively increased federal 

government because it would have to control all 

the infrastructure.  And then we would have, 

okay, now you can't discriminate based on this 

kind of infrastructure of how things work. 

That's not -- I mean, that is Orwell, 

right? So, for me, the answer is, for these 

kind of things like telephones or telegraphs or 

voluntary communications on the next big 

telephone/telegraph machine, those kind of

private communications have to be able to exist

 somewhere.  You know, the expression like, you

 know, "sir, this is a Wendy's."  There has to be

 some sort of way where we can allow people to

 communicate --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And is that just

 because of the -- the modern public square?  I

 mean, Mr. Clement has said many, many, many

 times that there's a distinction between public 

and private and that that's sort of driving his 

analysis as to when and under what circumstances 

this kind of regulation can be done. 

And -- and are you just rejecting that 

because you're suggesting that they merge in 

this situation given the nature of the 

communications? 

MR. NIELSON: I am not doing that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay. 

MR. NIELSON: And that's, again -- you 

know, I'll -- I'll try again to be artful. 

These are complicated concepts.  But I think 

about the common carrier as a really useful tool 

for this Court because we know that there's hard 

lines to draw.  It's really hard to tell the 

difference between FAIR and Miami Herald, like,

 get down to the granular level.  It's really

 kind of hard to tell.

 I think it would be helpful if the 

Court had a compass that could kind of, like, 

give us some direction of where to draw those

 lines. And common law, common carriage is that

 compass.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But are you 

suggesting that a common carrier, as the SG 

pointed out, could never have First Amendment 

protected activity?  I mean, that's why I keep 

going back to doesn't this have to be not at the 

level of entity but at the level of sort of what 

exactly are they doing in a particular 

circumstance?  Because you just seem to say, 

well, these are common carriers, so everything 

they do is conduct and, therefore, we can 

regulate it.  And I don't know that that's the 

way we've ever thought about this. 

MR. NIELSON: Well, it is how the 

Court thought about it with telegraphs, which I 

think is a useful way of -- of thinking about 

it. I mean, my friend in the government says,

say whatever they want about specific posts or

 anything, and that's fine.

 But there's a separate thing that they 

do, which is facilitate conversations between 

two people, which is like a phone.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I understand that.

 Now -- now one of the things that we've 

sometimes looked at in the past, this Court I 

mean, in the common carrier world is market 

power. 

MR. NIELSON: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And how do you 

analyze that here?  On the one hand, there are 

network effects that one would take account of 

in any analysis of -- of -- of market power, and 

that might -- might help you. On the other 

hand, this is a bit unlike a telegraph in the 

sense that there might only be one right-of-way 

to run the wires, and might be serious practical 

barriers for more than one set of wires. 

Here, one can start a new platform at 

least in theory anytime.

 entry but market effects.

 MR. NIELSON: Sure.  So the first

 answer is, if we are not talking about speech,

 if we're just in the world of conduct, then 

we're not talking about market power at all. 

And we know that because cellphones are

 intensely competitive markets and yet they're

 still all common carriers.  But let's move that

 aside. 

Now we're saying that there's some 

sort of, you know, reason to focus on market 

power. It's true.  This is not like the market 

power of there's just one bridge.  But, as an 

economic matter, there's really no difference. 

And I know this -- here's, like, a 

simple kind of way to look at it:  Twitter has 

its -- its -- its platform.  There's a lot of 

competitors for Twitter, would-be competitors, 

including Threads for Meta, which is backed by, 

like, one of the largest companies in the world. 

They invested massive amounts of money to try to 

break up the Twitter monopoly, and they failed 

miserably.  I mean --

we do about -- I mean, there's some legislative

what deference do we owe those, if any?

 MR. NIELSON: I would think

 considerable deference, Your Honor.  This is a

 sovereign state.  We don't usually treat states 

like the FTC where we subject it to, you know,

 arbitrary and capricious hard-look review.  The 

state is entitled to make determinations as a 

matter of law as to how things are. 

And, obviously, at some point, it 

might be so far afield, but some -- I sure hope 

that the states get, you know, some deference on 

such important questions from this Court.

that the government has the authority, by

 categorizing the members -- the participants in 

this dynamic market as common carriers, to take

 over extensive regulation of them, not with

 respect to communication, but all sorts of

 things.

 I mean, when you're talking about

 railroads or telegraphs, it's not just moving,

 transportation, it's what the railroads look 

like, what the safety things they have to have, 

a whole range of things, that, you know, in the 

wild west economy surrounding the social media 

platforms and the Internet may be totally inapt. 

Now, you know, I don't know if it 

comes at a time when you -- you -- you need to 

make that transition or not, but that is a very 

big step when it comes to the extent of 

government regulation. 

MR. NIELSON: I -- I certainly think 

that's fair.  My reaction -- my response is 

going to be this is a facial pre-enforcement 

injunction.  We should at least be able to make 

our showing on the facts.  We're quite confident 

that we would be able to show not just market 

power but durable, extensive market power here.

I -- I -- I actually don't think it

 would be even all that difficult to make that 

showing, so to the extent that market power is a

 requirement, I think that they haven't shown

 that -- that they're likely to -- they're likely 

to prevail on the merits as to that, which is 

another reason why a facial injunction is just

 simply inappropriate.

 Bring -- bring an as-applied case and 

we're happy to litigate that.  It's really hard 

to -- to, what's facially, they can pick a few 

examples, and then say the whole thing fails. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Nielson, what 

besides market power -- I want to give you a 

chance to elaborate on your definition of 

"common carrier."  I mean, you've said conduct, 

market power, what else? 

MR. NIELSON: Sure.  So the main 

requirement of common carrier, this is where 

common carriage and public accommodation are, if 

not, you know, cousins, maybe twins, is it has 

to be open to the public, which means that it's 

not a private associational group or something 

like that.  You hold their self out open to the 

public with non-differentiated contracts.  You

 that's the very first one.

 The second is it has to be the type of 

industry that has traditionally been regulated 

as such. So, for public accommodation, that's

 your inns and your restaurants.  For common

 carriage, that's where you're talking about 

things like bridges and -- and

 telecommunications. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But then you get 

into the problem of having to draw the analogy, 

right? I mean, the Chief just called the 

Internet kind of like, you know, the wild west 

of the Internet and the Internet looks a lot 

different.  Even each of these platforms has 

different functionalities within it. 

So, you know, when you extend common 

-- when you -- when you call -- you've got grist 

mills and then railroads and cable companies. 

MR. NIELSON: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Each time you 

encounter something new that might qualify as a 

common carrier, you have to make a decision does 

it -- does it fit the bill or not.

can keep going further. That's why some courts 

have said, well, maybe there's additional 

requirements that we put on common carriage. 

One is market power, which is, not everybody 

says, I don't know how that works with 

cellphones, but they said, well, you need market 

power, and the other was it has to be somehow

 invested with a public interest.

 And, here, under that, we know that if 

it's state action to block somebody from your 

Twitter account, how can that not be infected 

with a public interest?

 who's also a direct messaging app.

 And there's no question that your law 

covers them, but they tell us that their whole 

business model is to promote themselves to a

 particular message and groups of messages.  So

 they're not doing it indiscriminately.  You're

 basically saying to them, if they're out there

this -- this kind of business model.

I may, Your Honor. The first is, as to the

if you agree with all of that, I -- I -- I -- I

 still applications of this law that should be

 allowed to go into effect.

 I don't see how they can say that they

 can kick somebody off for off-platform speech of 

their grandmother.  That can't be.  Or because 

they don't like it where you live in Texas, you

Surely, that can't be okay.

you can't suddenly become a common carrier. 

That's why I think it's important to think of it

 as a compass to kind of tell you where the line

 is.

 But I would urge the Court, if you're 

interested, again, we've heard, you know, read

 Professor Volokh's article.

 One thing that really struck me as 

strange was, well, wait a minute, they have 

terms of service, so how can they be a common 

carrier?  Because if you have terms of service 

saying you can't do this. 

And this Court addressed that very 

problem.  The case -- the case that he cited is 

New York Central v. Lockwood from 1873 where the 

Court said you can't just get out of the duties 

of common carriage by contract.  If you're a 

common carrier, you're a common carrier unless 

you stop opening yourself up to the public.

subject to this law at all. If you choose to do 

business in Texas, then this provision kicks in, 

and you can't discriminate against people after 

you've chosen to do business in Texas based on 

the status that they're in Texas.

 But, if you don't want to do business 

in Texas at all, that's a separate provision,

 and you can get out of Texas.  This is the

 prohibition on what you can't do.  If you choose 

to do business in Texas, you can't darn well 

discriminate against somebody because they're in 

El Paso. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And doing business 

in Texas is -- is what, just allowing Facebook 

users to sign up in Texas, or is it, you know, 

Facebook accepting ad money from Texas 

corporations? 

MR. NIELSON: That question has not 

been resolved by any of the Texas courts because 

none of them have been. But, as I read it, it 

is you have to have, you know, customers in 

Texas. You've entered into contractual 

relationships with Texans. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah.  So Justice 

Barrett had exactly my same thought, and I'm --

I just want to clarify. So this doesn't speak 

in your view to a business decision not to offer

 services in Texas because, for example, their 

requirements are too burdensome.

 Instead, this is you're offering

 business in Texas and everywhere else, but you 

are prohibiting them from discriminating against 

people on the basis of their geography, meaning 

they're in Texas? 

MR. NIELSON: Yes, Your Honor.

 messages from point A to point B.  That's not

 what's going on here.

 We use the word in our -- our brief

 and from this Court's cases "disseminate."

 "Disseminate" means to spread broadly.  That

 means you're in the expressive enterprise

 business.  There's zero tradition of treating 

entities in the expressive enterprise business

 as common carriers. 

And then the -- the other factor is 

there really is like an essential facility.  You 

know, the telephone wires used to go, the copper 

wire, the last mile to every house in America. 

So, if you were kicked off Ma Bell, you were 

really out of luck.  This is the opposite 

situation in the Internet where you have lots of 

other choices. 

This is just not a common carrier. 

Not that that really is talismanic under the 

First Amendment anyways.  Justice Thomas made 

that point back in Denver telephone -- carrier 

case and he had it exactly right there. 

Now, second, public accommodation.  I 

wouldn't be worried about any other 

accommodation law -- public accommodation law.

No other public accommodation law prohibits 

discrimination on the basis of viewpoint and 

applies exclusively to speakers.

 That is a First Amendment red flag 

that you're trying to limit speakers' ability to

 discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.  That's 

just a frontal assault on editorial discretion.

 Every other public accommodation law that I'm

 aware of works differently. 

Third point, protecting kids. If 

you're at all concerned about protecting kids on 

the Internet, that should be a vote in our favor 

in this case because, if you can't do viewpoint 

discrimination, that disables us from doing many 

of the things that our companies try to do to 

protect youths online.  I mean, the -- the idea 

that, okay, we're going to have to choose 

between having -- if we have suicide prevention, 

we have to have suicide promotion to avoid 

viewpoint discrimination, that should be a 

non-starter. 

And protecting kids is important even 

as to the disclosure provision.  There is a 

record on this case at page 161 of the Joint 

Appendix, a witness from Stop Child Predators

 testified and said these disclosure provisions 

give a roadmap to predators to figure out why

 their messages aren't getting to children so 

they can figure out why they got bounced and 

they can try again and sort of work their way

 around.

 So the last point, and I think this is

 an important one to end on, this idea that

 somehow we're in -- in -- you know, behind the 

eight ball because we brought a facial 

challenge, there is a -- a proud tradition of 

facial challenges to vindicate First Amendment 

rights in this country.  That's how many of 

these cases have been brought.  There's an 

equally proud tradition of getting a preliminary 

injunction against a law that is chilling 

speech. 

And as the -- the General pointed out, 

I mean, the party presentation rules have to be 

foundational here. If we had gone into the 

district court and said this is unconstitutional 

on its face, and they said no, it's not because 

of Gmail, we could have had a fair debate about 

that. We could have modified our complaint if 

necessary.  That's a difficult issue.  As I

deals with it directly said Gmail is not a 

common carrier. But, in all events, we could

 have litigated all of that.  But the Plaintiffs'

 foreclose it in the district court.
