 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-976,

 Garland versus Cargill.

 Mr. Fletcher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court. 

To fire a rifle fitted with a bump 

stock, the shooter simply places his trigger 

finger on the built-in finger ledge and uses his 

other hand to press the front of the rifle 

forward.  As long as the shooter maintains that 

steady forward pressure, the rifle will fire 

continuously until it runs out of bullets, and 

it will empty a 100-round magazine like the ones 

used in the Las Vegas shooting in about 10 

seconds.  Those weapons do exactly what Congress 

meant to prohibit when it enacted the 

prohibition on machineguns, and those weapons 

are machineguns because they satisfy both 

disputed parts of the statutory definition. 

First, a rifle with a bump stock fires

more than one shot by a single function of the

 trigger.  In common usage today as in 1934, a 

function of the trigger happens when some act by 

the shooter, usually a pull, starts a firing

 sequence.  With a semiautomatic rifle, it fires 

one shot for each function of the trigger 

because the shooter has to manually pull and 

release the trigger for every shot. But a bump

 stock eliminates those manual movements and 

allows the shooter to fire many shots with one 

act, a forward push. 

Now Respondent says that a separate 

function of the trigger happens every time the 

trigger on a traditional rifle moves backwards 

and releases the hammer, even if it moves 

without any further manipulation by the shooter. 

But that is inconsistent with 

contemporaneous usage, does not account for guns 

with other kinds of triggers, and would make it 

trivially easy to evade the ban on machineguns 

just by automating the back-and-forth movement 

of the trigger after the shooter's initial pull. 

Second, a rifle with a bump stock 

fires more than one shot automatically, that is, 

through a self-regulating mechanism.  Once the

 shooter presses forward to fire the first shot, 

the bump stock uses the gun's recoil energy to 

create a continuous back-and-forth cycle that 

fires hundreds of shots per minute.

 Now Respondent says that that cycle is

 not automatic because the shooter has to keep up 

the forward pressure to keep the cycle going.

 But many traditional machineguns likewise 

require the shooter to maintain backward 

pressure on the trigger to maintain continuous 

fire. Either way, a single motion both 

initiates and maintains a multi-shot sequence, 

and either way, the weapon is a machinegun. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Fletcher, how 

does a machinegun -- what would I have to do to 

fire a machinegun? 

MR. FLETCHER:  It depends on the 

machinegun.  Some, it's a push of a -- a push of 

a button.  Some, it's a pull of a trigger.  The 

statutory definition is, does it shoot more than 

one shot automatically by a single function of 

the trigger? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But I don't have to 

do anything else? I don't have to put pressure

 MR. FLETCHER:  It depends on the gun

 again. So if you imagine -- I think what your 

question is getting at is, if you take a

 traditional M16 rifle --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah.

 MR. FLETCHER:  -- what we often think 

of when we think of a machinegun, you're right, 

to fire more than one shot, you pull the trigger 

and you have to hold it back, and as long as you 

maintain that backward pressure on the trigger, 

it keeps shooting. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  With a bump stock, 

what would I do different? 

MR. FLETCHER:  You would do different 

the -- the -- both the initial motion and the 

motion that continues.  It's the same thing in 

the sense that one motion automates 

back-and-forth movement and results in multiple 

shots. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what -- what --

MR. FLETCHER:  But it's a different 

motion. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- is happening with 

the -- a trigger-initiated firing of a

machinegun? What do I have to do other than

 depress the trigger?

 MR. FLETCHER:  With a traditional 

machinegun, again, take an M16 -- and, again, we

 think they're all machineguns -- but I

 understand the question to be take an M16, you 

pull the trigger back and you hold it and it

 keeps shooting.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. With --

MR. FLETCHER:  With a bump stock, you 

push forward, and that both initiates and 

continues the firing sequence. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And what is happening 

with the trigger when you have the recoil? 

MR. FLETCHER:  That's exactly right. 

So I think this gets to Respondent's primary 

argument on function of a trigger, which is that 

the difference with a bump stock is that it 

fires multiple shots automatically by automating 

the movement of the trigger. 

So my friend says the trigger moves 

back and forth every time a shot is fired.  Our 

view is that those subsequent movements of the 

trigger aren't functions of the trigger because 

they're not responding to separate acts,

           JUSTICE THOMAS: So what is happening

 with the trigger when someone doesn't need a

 bump stock to bump-fire a weapon?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So this is the man --

the unassisted manual bump firing --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- that's described, 

where an expert can take a regular semiautomatic 

rifle and hold it loosely enough that they can 

do something like bump firing. And I think, in 

our view there too, there's just one function of 

the trigger because the first push starts the 

sequence and then the sequence continues.  The 

ATF explained and we agree that that's not 

automatic because there's no self-regulating 

mechanism.  The user has to control the recoil. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what's the 

difference?  The same thing is happening with 

the trigger. 

MR. FLETCHER:  The same thing's 

happening with the trigger, and I think that's 

why we would say, with manual bump firing, there

is just a single function of the trigger. 

There's one action that initiates the firing

 sequence.  We think it's not automatic because

 there's no self-regulating mechanism.  The user 

is having to do all of the work that the bump 

stock automates for you on a rifle fitted with a

 bump stock.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm have --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  What about -- oh. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I'm having 

a little trouble with the non-trigger hand.  Are 

you just holding the gun, or are you moving, 

pushing it forward and then back and forward and 

then back? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I think the best 

place to look for this, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

the district court's factual findings, which are 

at pages 10 -- 102a to 104a of the Petition 

Appendix.  And what he explained is that from 

the shooter's perspective, it's just one 

continuous forward push.  The expert at trial 

said, mentally, you're doing nothing but pushing 

forward. 

Now, if you look and watch the slow --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other

 you moving your hand?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So what you are doing 

-- I want to distinguish between those two

 things actually --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- because what you are 

doing is just pushing forward.  Now, if you look 

at the videos that we cite in Footnote 1 of our 

reply brief, some of them are in slow motion, 

and they show that when the shooter is doing 

this, the hand is moving back and forth very 

fast, 600 times a second. 

That's not happening because the 

shooter is able to move their hand back and 

forth 600 -- or -- or, I'm sorry, 600 times a 

minute.  That's not happening because the 

shooter can move their hand back and forth that 

fast. That's happening because every time a 

shot is fired, the recoil drives the -- the 

rifle backwards, overcomes that steady forward 

pressure momentarily.  That's what lets the

 again. 

So, from the shooter's perspective, we 

view it as one act, and we think that's what the

 district court found.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So would it be right 

to say that the pressure is -- you know, on a 

typical machinegun where you're pulling and

 you're feeling, you know, continual backward 

pressure, and on this, you're feeling continual 

forward pressure of the opposite hand. 

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that right? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Exactly right.  And I 

think that's exactly what the district court 

found. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Fletcher, so I 

did watch all of these videos and try to figure 

out exactly what this looks like.  And I just 

want to ask you about this bump-firing thing.

something and I call it a bump band, because I

 So what if I design and market 

something I call a bump band to help me turn my

MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- in -- in the same 

way? Why wouldn't that then be a machinegun

MR. FLETCHER:  So we think that's 

still not functioning automatically because 

that's not a self-regulating mechanism.  My 

understanding is that what those devices do is 

they help the shooter keep their trigger finger 

still, but the shooter still has to manage the 

movement of the rifle back and forth, hold it so 

that it moves backwards just the right distance 

in just the right direction, then hold it again 

so it moves forward in just the right distance 

in just the right direction. 

And what makes a bump stock different 

is that it's a device that is built for just 

this purpose.  It has the finger ledge that 

holds your finger in place, but then it also has 

a sliding function built in so that when a shot

 rifle back, lets it disengage from the trigger 

so the shooter doesn't have to manually release 

it, and then allows it to slide forward again,

 again, just the right distance in just the right

 direction.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Maybe Mr. Mitchell 

can help me understand from his point of view 

what that means, because it seems like it helps 

you do it better and in a more stable way but 

that it functions the same way. 

But -- but the other question I 

have -- look, intuitively, I am entirely 

sympathetic to your argument, I mean, and it --

and it seems like, yes, that this is functioning 

like a machinegun would.  But, you know, looking 

at that definition, I think the question is, why 

didn't Congress pass that litigation -- I mean 

that legislation to -- to make this cover it 

more clearly? 

I think your argument depends on 

volition, right, so let me give you a 

hypothetical, and then tell me if you think this 

satisfies the definition of a machinegun.

 automatic machinegun, and I won't try to come up 

with the technology for exactly how this is 

going to happen, but they install a tripwire on

 their property and they just leave the gun there

 unattended, walk away. Somebody trips the wire 

and then it begins shooting lots of rounds.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Does that satisfy

 your definition of a machinegun? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I think it does, yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Because a single act 

and, you know, I think we've used different 

words like volition.  I think what we're -- the 

idea that we're trying to get at is, does some 

separate act, is that required, some manual act 

required for each shot, or is a single 

continuous act resulting in the firing of 

multiple shots. 

That's an unusual way to activate a 

machinegun, obviously --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- but I think, even if 

it's a tripwire, that's still one act by a 

person that initiates a multi-shot firing.

 work, you still have to have your finger right

 there, right? 

MR. FLETCHER:  You do, yeah.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  And -- and it -- and

 it -- according to the Fifth Circuit, what

 you're focusing on is the definition, you know, 

it looked at it from the perspective of the gun 

and the machinery of the gun, but you still do 

need your finger there to kind of pull back the 

trigger the same way that you would if it was 

volitional.

Justice Barrett.  And I think this is important. 

When -- in the typical way that you fire these 

bump stocks -- and this the Fifth Circuit 

acknowledged at 21a of the Petition Appendix --

you don't initiate firing by pulling backward 

with your trigger finger.  The trigger finger 

stays completely stationary.

trigger finger with a little plastic post 

attached to the bump stock and it would work in 

exactly the same way.

 So it's -- it's true that you have to 

keep your finger there, and if you moved your 

finger away, the bump firing sequence would

 stop, but that's a pretty trivial additional 

piece of input from the shooter. Really, what's 

starting and continuing the sequence is the push 

forward. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you, just 

kind of maybe stepping back a moment, why do 

these various distinctions with respect to 

operations matter? 

I mean, I -- I read this statute to be 

a classification statute, that Congress is 

directing everyone or us to identify certain 

kinds of weapons, and those certain kinds of 

weapons are being treated in a particular way. 

They're being prohibited. 

And so I guess what I'm trying to 

understand is, if -- if it's true that, you 

know, the distinction that is being focused on

here is the one between the movement of the 

trigger going back and forth or the trigger 

staying the same, I'm trying to understand why 

that matters for the purpose of this

 classification.

 MR. FLETCHER:  So I think we don't

 think it does because we don't think "function 

of the trigger" means movement of the trigger. 

We think it means act of the shooter. 

That's how it was used at the time by 

educated speakers of English, including the 

president of the NRA when --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Ah. 

MR. FLETCHER:  -- he proposed the 

language that became this statute to Congress, 

and ever since, people have equated function of 

the trigger with pull of the trigger.  That 

makes perfect sense if, like us, you read 

"function of the trigger" to mean some act by 

the shooter.  I don't think that works on my 

friend's account. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I guess I'm 

wondering -- I thought your answer was going to 

be, we don't think it matters because of 

something you said in the intro, which was

that's -- these are the kind of weapons that

 Congress were -- was intending to prohibit 

because of the damage they cause or something 

like that. Like I read the word "function" to 

be doing significant work in this statute.

 And when, you know, "function" is 

defined, it's really not about the operation of 

the thing. It's about what it can achieve, what

 it's being used for.  So I see Congress as 

putting function in this.  The function of this 

trigger is to cause this kind of damage, 800 

rounds a second or whatever. 

And -- and -- and so the 

classification of weapons that we're trying to 

identify with this statute are those that 

function in that same way. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So, Justice Jackson, I 

agree with most of that, but I want to be 

careful because our -- our view is not that 

because Congress banned machineguns because 

they're dangerous, anything that's dangerous or 

that shoots fast is a machinegun. 

Our -- we draw the evident purpose of 

Congress that we think my friend's 

interpretation would frustrate from the text

that Congress enacted.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  And so how 

about anything in which the trigger functions in

 the same way, and by "function," I don't know

 that that necessarily means it has to move in

 the same way.  It has to operate in the same

 way. It can function in the same way insofar as 

it automatically allows for 800 rounds to be

 released. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So exactly.  We think 

the function of the trigger is what lets the 

shooter start the firing sequence. And we think 

all of the parts of the statutory definition are 

aimed at we're worried about guns that let you 

shoot many shots without repeated manual 

actions, right.  So it's -- it's single function 

of the trigger.  Does the shooter have to do one 

thing or many things? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Fletcher, on --

on that score, can we just step back a minute? 

I -- I can certainly understand why these items 

should be made illegal, but we're dealing with a 

statute that was enacted in the 1930s, and

took the position that these bump stocks are not

 machineguns.

 And then you -- you adopted an 

interpretive rule, not even a legislative rule,

 saying otherwise that would render between a 

quarter of a million and a half million people 

federal felons and not even through an APA 

process they could challenge subject to 10 years 

in federal prison, and the only way they can 

challenge it is if they're prosecuted, and they 

may well wind up dispossessed of guns, all guns 

in the future, as well as a lot of other civil 

rights, including the right to vote. 

And I -- I guess I just want your 

reaction to -- to that.  And I believe there are 

a number of members of Congress, including 

Senator Feinstein, who said that this 

administrative action forestalled legislation 

that would have dealt with this topic directly, 

rather than trying to use a nearly 100-year-old

hadn't anticipated.

 thoughts.  I -- I think the main one is this

 Court often concludes that the government has

 interpreted a statute the wrong way and doesn't

 hesitate to correct the government's mistakes. 

I think the government should do the same thing.

 After the Las Vegas shooting, the

 deadliest shooting in our nation's history, I

 think it would have been irresponsible for the 

ATF not to take another closer look at this 

prior interpretation, which was reflected in a 

handful of classification letters, and to look 

at the problem more carefully. 

And having done that, I think it would 

have been irresponsible if the ATF concluded, as 

it did, that these devices are prohibited under 

the best reading of the statute for the ATF not 

to fix its errors. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Then why not do a 

legislative rule properly and in which -- I -- I 

know you did notice-and-comment, but it was an 

interpretive rule, and an interpretive rule you 

can more or less just issue and you don't even 

have to put it in the Federal Register.  I mean, 

maybe you do in some circumstances, but not all.

something a crime that wasn't a crime before. 

It's not a crime to violate the rule. It has 

been and always will be a crime to violate the 

statute. The ATF is saying, we got that wrong 

before and we're fixing it now.

 And you're right, it would be horribly 

unfair to prosecute people who possessed these 

devices in reliance on the agency's past 

assurance, but that is taken care of through 

doctrines like entrapment by estoppel, which 

ensure that no one has been and no one will be 

prosecuted for possessing these guns during --

or these devices during a time when ATF said it 

was legal. 

But that's not a reason to shackle the 

ATF and certainly not a reason to shackle this 

Court to adopt something other than the best 

reading of the words Congress wrote.  And it's 

true, Congress wrote those words 90 years ago, 

but we think it used capacious language like 

function of a trigger instead of pull of a 

trigger and then, in 1968, added parts that can 

be used to convert something into a machinegun

 think you should hesitate from applying the 

broad language that Congress wrote, consistent 

with the meaning that it has always had.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What's the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I -- thank

 you. 

Are -- are you representing on behalf 

of the government that you're not going to 

prosecute anyone prior to 2017?  Anyone who 

wasn't a felon or -- or disqualified for some 

other reason? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I am.  ATF made very 

clear in enacting this rule that anyone who 

turned in their bump stock or destroyed it 

before March of 2018 would not face prosecution. 

As a practical matter also, the 

statute of limitations for this offense is five 

years, so in a month, the statute of limitations 

would be gone.  We have not prosecuted those 

people.  We won't do it.  And if we try to do 

it, I think they would have a good defense based 

on entrapment by estoppel.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Second, the

 back-and-forth here leads me to believe that at 

best there might be some ambiguity. Now the

 question is what's the best reading.  And we 

have a whole slew of doctrines that talk about

 that with respect to that we shouldn't render 

statutes ineffective by an interpretation.

 That's not the best reading, correct?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Correct, exactly. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I think we've 

said that as far back as 1824. 

MR. FLETCHER:  In The Emily, exactly. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In The Emily case. 

And so I think your position is, if anyone's in 

doubt about this interpretation, that not 

including something that basically you hold in 

your hand and you let the recoil move it back 

and forth, if that's not automatic, then it 

doesn't make any sense that this is not a 

machinegun, correct? 

MR. FLETCHER:  That's part of our 

argument, absolutely.  And it's not just this 

device.  I mean, we cite a number of the 

examples, and the -- and there are many more, of 

things that people have done to try to get

 around the ban on machineguns, and accepting 

some of the interpretations that my friend is

 offering today would legalize not just bump 

stocks but those devices as well.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  One final

 question.  Justice Barrett said something about

 she hoped Mr. Mitchell would explain something

 about why there was a difference in the

 functioning between the belt and the gun.  Could 

you go through that again so that -- I think I 

understand it, but --

MR. FLETCHER:  Of course.  So, as I 

acknowledge and as the ATF explained in the 

rule, it is possible to do bump firing, meaning 

that the rifle moves back and forth and bumps 

against your stationary finger.  An expert can 

do that without any assistive device at all. 

And you can also do it if you have a lot of 

expertise by hooking your finger into a belt 

loop or using a rubber band or something else 

like that to hold your finger in place. 

We don't think those things function 

automatically because the definition of 

"automatically," I think everybody agrees, is by 

means of a self-regulating mechanism.  That's

what a bump stock is. It's a device that is

 purpose-built to harness the recoil energy of 

the gun to automate the process of releasing the 

trigger to move the rifle back just the right 

distance in just the right direction so that the 

trigger resets and then to ensure that the rifle

 moves forward again, again, just the right

 distance, just the right direction.

 We think the cycle that's created by 

that means is by means of a self-regulating 

process.  It's possible to do the same thing 

with a lot of manual work and manual control and 

expertise, but that's not unusual to say that 

something can be done automatically by a device 

if you eliminate a lot of manual movements that 

someone like an expert could take to do the same 

thing. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Can I ask you 

about mens rea, to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's 

questions?  For prosecuting someone now, what 

mens rea showing would the government have to

facts that render your weapon a machinegun.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So, even if you 

are not aware of the legal prohibition, you can

 be convicted?

 MR. FLETCHER:  That's right, but 

that's true of all machineguns, I mean, all

 different sorts of devices.  I think the

 distinct problem here is the one that's created 

by the fact that the agency was previously 

saying that these were not machineguns.  We 

acknowledge that those people who, in reliance 

on that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I mean, that --

that's going to ensnare a lot of people who are 

not aware of the legal prohibition. 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I guess I don't 

think so, Justice Kavanaugh.  I think the ATF --

one of the reasons, to Justice Gorsuch's point, 

this is an interpretive rule that went through 

notice-and-comment -- the reason was in part 

because the agency knew that it had previously 

been saying something different. It wanted to 

maximize public notice.  This is something 

that's gotten a lot of coverage.

why not require the government to also prove

 that the person knew that what they were doing

 was wrongful, was illegal?

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah -- well, I -- I 

think that's not the understanding that this

 Court adopted in Staples.  If the Court wanted 

to revisit that in another case, a criminal

 case, you could.  We haven't briefed that

 question here. 

But I think, to the extent that you're 

concerned about that, it's -- it's not a concern 

unique to bump stocks.  We mention all sorts of 

other devices, the forced reset trigger that we 

mentioned.  The -- the problem of people coming 

up with devices that they want -- that they 

think get close to the line but don't go over 

but that, in fact, go over the line and turn 

them into machineguns isn't new and could come 

up anywhere. 

The problem here, we acknowledge, is 

ATF used to say something different about these, 

but we think that's taken care of by the 

rulemaking and the doctrine of entrapment by 

estoppel.

 I learned that was an intransitive verb.

 MR. FLETCHER:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And people don't 

function things. They may pull things, they may

 throw things, but they don't function things. 

And, again, it's a very old statute, and it was 

designed for an obvious problem in the 1930s and 

Al Capone, and people were -- with a single 

function of the trigger, that is, the thing 

itself, was moved once, and that's what they 

wrote. 

And maybe they should have written 

something better.  One might hope they might 

write something better in the future.  But 

that's the language we're stuck with.  Help me.

we're stuck with, but I don't think it's as

 word, not "pull," is because Congress knew that 

there were lots of different ways to activate a 

trigger and wanted to cover all of them.

 And I think the reason you know that 

it's referring to what the shooter does --

 there's really two.  One is that's the way it's

 been understood ever since.  The interpretation 

I'm giving you is the same one Karl Frederick,

 the president of the NRA, and many other courts, 

executive officials, Congressmen gave at the 

same time.  They used "pull" and "function" 

interchangeably. 

And, second, I think, even if you've 

said we're going to focus just on the trigger, 

the function of an object isn't just some action 

by the object.  It's the mode of action by which 

it fulfills its purpose.  And the purpose of a 

trigger is to accept some input from the user. 

And the way you know that is how 

everyone reacts when someone attaches it to some 

contraption like the AutoGlove, which is a glove 

that you put on and you push a button and it has 

a little piston that pulls the trigger really 

fast, or you attach a fishing reel, like the one 

the Fifth Circuit confronted in Camp, where you

 over and over again.

 On my friend's reading, the function 

of the trigger with those devices is exactly the 

same because the curved metal lever is moving 

back and it's releasing the hammer every single

 time. But everyone, my friend included, 

recognizes that that's not the function of the 

trigger in those devices. 

The function of the trigger is the 

user's flip of the switch or push of the button 

because that's the thing that allows an act by 

the user to initiate a firing sequence. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: Mr. Fletcher, I -- I 

take it that the ATF defined the curved lever 

that you pull back as the trigger.  Could it 

have defined the bump stock itself as the 

trigger? 

MR. FLETCHER:  So I'm -- I'm not sure 

that it could have defined the bump stock itself 

as the trigger.  I think -- we get into this a 

little bit in the reply in response -- or a -- a 

different argument maybe than the one that 

you're thinking of but I think related, in 

response to a move that's made in the red brief,

where we hypothesize that if you had a 

machinegun that required you to pull the trigger 

and also hold down a button, it would still fire

 automatically, and we all understand that, even

 though you have to do two things rather than

 one.

 And what my friend said in the red

 brief is, well, in that case, maybe the button 

is part of the trigger too because you have to 

push the button to keep firing.  And what we say 

in the reply and what I think is true is that if 

you were going to approach the statute that way, 

which isn't the way the ATF has, I think you'd 

still land in the same place because then you'd 

say, it's both the curved metal lever and it's 

the part on the front of the rifle that the user 

pushes forward in order to initiate and maintain 

the firing sequence.

 Fifth Circuit decision?  Can they be prosecuted?

 MR. FLETCHER:  I think probably yes, 

unless they had gotten some judicial relief from

 the rule.  The rule has not been enjoined.  It 

hasn't been vacated, writ large, so I think the

 what we think the statute means.

 I'll say in practice that --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that disturbing? 

People in the Fifth Circuit who have been 

possessing firearms since the beginning of 2023,

the Fifth Circuit's decision that they can be 

criminally prosecuted for doing something that 

the court of appeals that governs their 

territory has said is not illegal? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Well, let me give a 

practical answer and then a doctrinal answer.  I 

think, practically, I'm not aware of a lot of 

these prosecutions being brought because we 

recognize that there is some legal uncertainty. 

But I think, doctrinally, that could 

happen all the time, Justice Alito.  Circuits 

disagree about what a criminal law means, and

precedent, do something that they think is

 JUSTICE ALITO:  When we speak of the

 function of an inanimate object, don't we

object does?  So why isn't the function of a 

trigger to release the hammer -- let's look at 

the -- the -- the M16, the AR-15, the function 

of the -- why isn't the function of the trigger 

to release the hammer from the sear so that the 

hammer can swing forward and strike?  Isn't that 

the most straightforward interpretation of this? 

MR. FLETCHER:  I -- I don't think so, 

and I think, even if you thought that was true, 

just looking at the text alone, the three 

indications that we've talked about, the 

contemporaneous usage by the president of the 

NRA and others, the application to other kinds 

of triggers, which everybody agrees are covered

about some of them, but one of the devices that

 the Fifth Circuit has held is permissible -- or, 

I'm sorry, a district court in the Fifth Circuit 

has held is permissible and the Fifth Circuit 

has declined to stay is something called a

 forced reset trigger, and with a forced reset 

trigger, the ATF tested it, zip-tied the trigger

 back, and the gun shot multiple bullets.

 What the district court said is that 

under my friend's interpretation, its 

function -- there are multiple functions of the 

trigger because the trigger is wiggling back and 

forth imperceptibly and releasing the hammer 

separately each time, and so it's not a 

machinegun. 

And I think it's just not reasonable 

to read the statute that opens it up to that 

sort of evasion, and we're seeing concrete 

evidence of that evasion in the Fifth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, you've

various devices.  Could you give a sense of the 

different effects of these various devices? 

So you take on two poles a 

semiautomatic weapon, let's say, and a 

conventional machinegun on the -- on the other. 

How many bullets and how much time?  And then 

one of these bump stock weapons, where does that 

fall in the spectrum between those? 

MR. FLETCHER:  Sure.  So the rate of a 

semiautomatic weapon is not a fixed number 

because it depends both on the weapon and very 

much on the skill of the shooter. I think the 

Giffords amicus brief says the theoretical 

maximum for a very skilled competition shooter 

with a specialized weapon is something like 180 

bullets a minute.  In practice, it's much, much

 who would use one of these things.

 A fully automatic weapon --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How -- how much

 slower?

 MR. FLETCHER:  I think, you know,

 it -- it depends.  I -- I think more on the

 order of, you know, 60, something like that.  I

 don't -- I don't want to represent that that's 

exact again because there's a lot of variation, 

but the -- the point is that's the theoretical 

max. In practice, it's significantly slower 

than that. 

A traditional machinegun like the M16 

or the M14, things that are issued to members of 

the American military, shoots in the range of 

700 to 950 bullets a minute. 

There are obviously bigger things like 

the things mounted on helicopters that shoot 

much, much faster than that, but I think, for 

these purposes, that 700 to 900 is about the 

right benchmark. 

The Akins Accelerator, the original 

bump stock, shot at 650 rounds a minute, and the 

devices at issue here are represented to shoot

 So right in that range with the M16, 

the M14, and they do it in the way -- again,

 I -- I think rates of fire are important, but we 

acknowledge this is not a rate-of-fire statute.

 It's a function statute.

 But the function was, are you able to 

fire multiple shots without multiple manual

 movements?  And I think the rate of fire is 

powerful evidence that there are not multiple 

manual movements going on here.

of these workarounds, the fishing reel, the

 AutoGlove, the forced reset trigger, all of them

 are new problems.

 But -- but I think what you can draw 

is that Congress wrote a statute, chose the word 

"function" deliberately because it didn't want

 to just work -- focus on triggers that pull, and 

then, in 1968, it added "parts that convert a

 machine" -- a -- "a normal gun into a 

machinegun" because it recognized that people 

try to do things to semiautomatic weapons in 

order to give them these same characteristics of 

multiple rounds with a single manual action.

your explanation, maybe common-sense explanation 

or some other explanation, for why, when this

the Obama Administration, Senator Feinstein, all 

say no?

 explanation for that, if you have one?

 MR. FLETCHER:  So I agree with you. 

It's -- it's -- it's worth looking at. It's 

worth asking.  I think that's why it's so 

important to put it in context. 

And -- and if I could, so when the ATF 

first looks at these, it's the Akins Accelerator 

in 2002.  That's the bump stock with a spring in 

the back where you don't even have to push 

forward.  And initially ATF tests it, the 

prototype breaks, but the ATF writes a 

classification letter, which is something 

relatively informal, just goes to the 

manufacturer, doesn't contain a lot of legal 

reasoning, says this isn't a machinegun because 

it doesn't have multiple functions of the 

trigger. 

Very quickly thereafter, ATF corrects

that error and in 2006 says the Akins 

Accelerator is a machinegun because it does

 function by -- it does shoot multiple shots by a

 single function of the trigger.

 So that part we've been consistent on. 

The director of the ATF issued a ruling, 2006-2, 

that was consistent on that, and the agency has 

held that position ever since, and that's mostly 

what we've talked about today. 

It's true that in a series of 

additional -- a -- another informal 

classification letters is issued between 2007 

and 2017, the ATF said that non-mechanical bump 

stocks, those like the ones at issue here 

without a spring where you have to push forward, 

weren't machineguns because they didn't shoot 

automatically. 

But I -- I think it's important to 

recognize those are informal, they don't include 

a lot of legal analysis, and I think maybe most 

importantly, no one defends the ATF's 

interpretation from those letters.  What the ATF 

said there is this doesn't have springs or 

mechanical parts, so it doesn't make guns -- the 

gun function automatically.

I think even my friend doesn't defend

 that interpretation.  Everybody recognizes that

 there are things like Glock switches that we 

discuss in our reply brief that you can add to a

 machinegun -- a -- a semiautomatic weapon that

 make it a machinegun, and I think the fact that

 no one is defending the ATF's prior 

interpretation is a good indication that when

 Attorney General Sessions and Attorney General 

Barr revisited this and we've continued to 

defend it since, they did a much more careful 

examination and got it right. 

And then Senator Feinstein, you know, 

I -- I take your point. I guess, with all 

respect to Senator Feinstein, I would say that 

the comments from a legislator who's trying to 

get a piece of legislation passed and is trying 

to demonstrate the need for that legislation by 

disagreeing with the administration about the 

scope of current law are not a particularly 

probative source of the meaning of the words 

that Congress enacted in 1934.

the trigger, it's not how the trigger operates,

achieves, and the function that I think you're 

saying is that if by single operation, meaning 

single movement of the person, you can achieve 

firing multiple shots without multiple manual 

movements, that's what you said --

hypothetical on page 30 of our brief where we

 say imagine somebody builds a black box with a

 button on the top and the shooter pushes the 

button once and bullets come out of the front at 

a very high rate. On our view, that's a

 machinegun.

 But, on my friend's view, if the 

inventor sets it up so that after the shooter 

pushes and releases the button the button keeps 

moving up and down in the same way on its own, I 

think he's stuck saying that that's not a 

machinegun because the trigger is functioning 

each time a shot is fired.  We don't think 

that's a plausible construction of the statute.

about that.  And -- and I guess yours is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. MITCHELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MITCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 The statutory definition of machinegun 

extends only to weapons that fire more than one 

shot automatically by a single function of the

 trigger.  Mr. Cargill's non-mechanical bump 

stocks fall outside the statutory definition for 

two separate and independent reasons. 

First, a bump stock-equipped rifle can 

fire only one shot per function of the trigger 

because the trigger must reset after every shot 

and must function again before another shot can 

be fired. 

The trigger is the device that 

initiates the firing of the weapon, and the 

function of the trigger is what that triggering 

device must do to cause the weapon to fire. 

The phrase "function of the trigger" 

can refer only to the trigger's function.  It 

has nothing to do with the shooter or what the 

shooter does to the trigger because the shooter 

does not have a function. 

The statute is concerned only with

what the trigger does and whether a single 

function of that trigger produces more than one

 shot.

 Second, a bump stock-equipped rifle 

does not and cannot fire more than one shot

 automatically by a single function of the 

trigger because the shooter, in addition to 

causing the trigger to function, must also

 undertake additional manual actions to ensure a 

successful round of bump firing. 

Everything about the bump firing 

process is manual.  And there is no automating 

device, such as a spring or a motor, in any of 

Mr. Cargill's non-mechanical bump stocks. 

The process depends entirely on human 

effort and exertion as the shooter must 

continually and repeatedly thrust the forestock 

of the rifle forward with his non-shooting hand 

while simultaneously maintaining backward 

pressure on the weapon with his shooting hand. 

None of these acts are automated.  And 

the Solicitor General has yet to identify any 

component of Mr. Cargill's devices that 

automatically performs any task that is 

necessary for bump firing.  The statute is

 unambiguous as applied to Mr. Cargill's

 non-mechanical bump stocks, and we ask the Court

 to affirm on that ground.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Behind the

 government's argument is a sense that the --

this statute was initially enacted because of

 what some of the individuals did during

 Prohibition.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And there was 

significant damage from machineguns, carnage, 

people dying, et cetera.  And the -- behind this 

is a notion that the bump stock does the exact 

same thing. 

So, with that background, why 

shouldn't we look at a broader definition of 

"function," one suggested by the -- the 

government, as opposed to just the narrow 

function that you suggest? 

MR. MITCHELL:  The problem with the 

government's argument, Justice Thomas, is that 

the phrase "single function of the trigger" can 

only be construed grammatically to focus on the 

trigger's function and not on what the shooter 

does to the trigger.

And that's so for many reasons.  For 

-- for one thing, there cannot be a subject of 

"function" because a shooter does not function a 

trigger. Only a trigger can have a function and

 not a shooter.

 Now the Solicitor General is trying to 

replace the word "function" in the statute with

 the word "pull."  And if the statute had 

actually said a single pull of the trigger, that 

phrase would clearly refer to an act taken by 

the shooter because only a shooter can pull the 

trigger.  The trigger certainly can't pull 

itself. 

So, if the Court is going to interpret 

the statute based on what it says rather than 

based on the purposes or perhaps the overarching 

goals of what the 1934 legislature might have 

been, there's no way it could accept the 

government's construction of the statute because 

it is changing the enacted words. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I give you a 

way? Possibly? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Please. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So the 

statute says "function," as we've all

 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And as far as I can

 tell, the sort of common usage of the word

 "function" is not its operational design.  It's 

not the mechanics of the thing. It is what it

 achieves, what it's being used for.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I found 

definitions.  "Function" is defined as "the 

action for which a person or thing is 

specifically fitted or used"; the acts or 

operations expected of the person or thing. 

So, if we take that definition --

MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- it seems to me 

that, through its use of the word "function," 

Congress was trying to capture a class of 

weapons in which a trigger is used once to 

achieve a certain result, which says, in the 

statute, automatic firing many times. 

And so weapons with bump stocks have 

triggers that function in the same way. They --

trigger or -- you -- touch of the trigger, you

 grammar or the -- the -- the way the statute

 reads?

 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, the -- the

 premise of Your Honor's question is not true.  A 

single discharge of the trigger produces only 

one shot.  It doesn't produce a round of 

automatic fire.  The only way you get to 

repeated shots with a bump stock equipped rifle 

is for the shooter himself to continually 

undertake manual action by thrusting the 

forestock of the rifle forward with his 

non-shooting hand. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's not the 

trigger.  He's only touched the -- he's holding 

the trigger or touched the trigger once, right? 

MR. MITCHELL:  No. He touches the 

trigger every single time.  He has to bump the 

trigger.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, but what I'm

that the category of prohibition is about the 

high rate of fire as opposed to, you know, the 

movement of the trigger.  And if you're right

just asking why, why would -- why would Congress 

want to prohibit certain things based on whether

the trigger is moving as opposed to certain 

things that can achieve this, you know, lethal

 kind of spray of bullets?

 MR. MITCHELL:  Because the statute was 

written in 1934, about a hundred years before we 

had bump stocks. So Congress drafted the 

statute at that time to capture the type of 

weaponry it wanted to prohibit in 1934, so --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Your interpretation, 

Mr. Mitchell, though -- you've said this several 

times in your brief -- captures a fair number of 

weapons that nobody had on their radar screen in 

1934, so let me ask you about that and where the 

line is. 

MR. MITCHELL:  Sure. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If a gun fires 

multiple shots at the push of a button or the 

flip of a switch and just keeps firing -- -

MR. MITCHELL: Yes. Clearly, that's a 

machinegun. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that's a 

machinegun? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. That's United 

States against Camp essentially.

 the push of two buttons?

 MR. MITCHELL:  So one button that

 fires and then the other button that's

 necessary?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Both buttons necessary?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

 MR. MITCHELL:  And neither are by 

themselves sufficient? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  I thought you 

say also, on page 45 of your brief, that a -- a 

-- a push-operated machinegun that requires the 

shooter to push and hold two buttons, that that 

would also qualify. 

MR. MITCHELL:  Right, because the two 

buttons together are acting as the trigger in 

that scenario. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

MR. MITCHELL:  So the trigger is the 

device that initiates the firing of the weapon. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

MR. MITCHELL:  So, if you need to push 

two buttons and not just one, then both, the two 

buttons combined, are the trigger.

the device that initiates the firing of the

 weapon.

 A bump stock does not change the

 trigger in any way.  It does not alter the

 nature of the trigger.  The other hypothetical 

devices that Your Honor is describing are 

changing the triggering device either by

 requiring pushing two buttons rather than just

 one -- nothing in the bump stock changes the 

trigger.  The trigger is still in this situation 

the curved metal lever, and the Solicitor 

General has never contested that point, neither 

has DOJ, at any point in this litigation. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Mitchell, I --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And, Mr. Mitchell, 

this -- this conversation is totally confusing 

me because I -- I thought that your argument 

depended on what the trigger -- that the 

function of the trigger was what the trigger 

does mechanically inside the weapon, and, 

therefore, whether you have one trigger or two 

triggers or three triggers or 10 buttons, it 

doesn't matter.  It matter -- what matters is

A -- a -- a -- a -- an M6 -- back in

 the day when it was possible to fire the 

standard military issue rifle, M16, from the 

1970s on automatic, my understanding is that the

 military doesn't even -- you can't even do that

 anymore. All you can fire at most is a burst of

 three shots.

 But there are two buttons on -- on the 

-- on the old-time M16. You have to flip the --

well, there are three.  You have to -- you have 

to flip it over from semiautomatic to automatic. 

That's one button.  And then the other button is 

the pulling of the trigger. 

But do I misunderstand your argument? 

MR. MITCHELL:  No, you're not 

misunderstanding at all.  The function of the 

trigger is what the trigger does to cause the 

weapon to fire.  That's what "function of the 

trigger" means. 

But, to determine that, we need to 

first determine what exactly the trigger is 

before we can consider what is the function of 

the trigger. And there will be certain types of 

devices like this motorized trigger device in 

United States against Camp where the trigger

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now I'm completely

 lost. The trigger is not doing anything.  It's

 the person doing something.  And it's the person 

choosing on an M16 whether they're going to keep 

the switch on semiautomatic or put the switch on 

automatic and turn the M16 into a machinegun. 

And on a machinegun, it's not the 

trigger that does this.  It's the pressure that 

the shooter is using to hold the trigger down 

that permits it to keep going.

trigger to function.

 down -- keeping the trigger down or holding the

 in an automatic recoil.

 Those are not things that changes the

 automatic nature of the firing.

 MR. MITCHELL:  It still has nothing to 

do with what the shooter does. The question is

 what does the trigger do when it functions.  And 

if the trigger allows more than one shot to fire 

per function of the trigger, what is the single 

function of the trigger?  And on a semi --

MR. MITCHELL:  Because the bump stock 

doesn't fire the weapon. The bump stock is just 

a case in which the weapon slides back and 

forth. That doesn't do anything to fire the 

weapon.  The only way --

 sufficient for the firing of the weapon.  It's

achievable through bump stocks is effectively 

the equivalent, and we should take cognizance of

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but the statute 

doesn't say a lot of things that you've agreed 

are prohibited under the statute. The statute 

doesn't, you know, think about buttons, and the

 statute doesn't think about switches.

 And I have to think that if I gave you

 a different hypo that said it was

 voice-activated that you would have to say yes, 

that's a machinegun too.  And the statute 

doesn't think about that. 

And I guess what Justice Gorsuch is 

saying is that you in arguing this case have had 

to do something very sensible because, 

otherwise, it would seem, you know, like, you 

know, that this statute is loaded with 

anticircumvention devices.  The entire way this 

statute is written suggests that Congress was 

very aware -- aware that there could be small 

adjustments of a weapon that could get around 

what Congress meant to prohibit. 

And -- and -- and in all kinds of 

ways, you're accepting of that and saying yes, 

you can't circumvent it by that. You can't 

circumvent it by non-conventional triggers.  You

 things that -- these hypotheticals I've been

 giving you.  But you can circumvent it through

 this one mechanism.

 MR. MITCHELL:  I'm not conceding that 

you can circumvent the statute, Justice Kagan.

 We're just interpreting the word "trigger," 

which is a term that appears in the statutory

 text and it has to be interpreted. 

When you're dealing with the motorized 

trigger device, that's an easy case in one 

direction because that has changed the trigger 

from the curved metal lever because the shooter 

is no longer using that to fire the weapon. 

Instead, there's a switch that is 

flipped and that switch is now triggering the 

device because that is the function, turning on 

the switch, that then causes automatic fire to 

occur because there's some motor that's moving 

the trigger back -- I'm sorry, I shouldn't say 

the trigger -- the curved metal lever back and 

forth. That's United States against Camp. 

This is an easy case because the bump 

stock doesn't change the trigger in any way.

 were these flat metal pieces that were mailed 

internationally to the defendant machineguns. 

And we were all confused.  The jury 

was confused because we had this notion of what 

a machinegun was.  And the government argued 

that this metal piece was a machinegun and 

brought in experts that said, under this 

statute, anything that can be used to convert a 

regularly operating semiautomatic weapon into 

one that rapid fires qualifies.

Jackson, rapid --

 of the trigger.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I'm sorry.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Okay.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  They said it could. 

But what we focused on was not whether that 

metal piece changed the way the trigger 

operated.  Now maybe you're saying that's wrong, 

but I guess what I'm focused on is that your 

argument seems to rest on the assumption that 

the function of the trigger, as Justice Alito 

says, is what the trigger does inside the gun. 

MR. MITCHELL:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why is it 

irrational, wrong, et cetera, to think of the 

function of the trigger is -- as what it does to 

cause the weapon to automatically fire more than 

one shot? 

If that's what we mean by "function of 

the trigger," which is in the statute, 

automatically more than one shot, and what we're

 automatically fire more than one shot, I guess I

 don't understand why your reading is preferable

 to that when -- when -- when the common

 understanding of a machinegun is that it is

 doing this sort of thing at the end of the day.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, it's because the 

trigger on a bump stock equipped rifle does not

 cause the rifle to automatically fire more than 

one shot.  You still have to have manual action 

by the shooter in response to every single shot 

that gets fired.  The shooter has to continue to 

thrust that forestock forward --

 why there's something inherently so much worse 

about a situation in which you push it forward 

rather than pull it back that that -- that we 

can reasonably say that that was a particular

 category that Congress wanted to prohibit?

 And that's what I'm missing in your

 argument.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, it's -- it's 

because -- yeah. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  It doesn't make 

sense to me that we're going to identify guns on 

that purpose and say those are the ones that 

prohibit -- that are prohibited when others that 

achieve the same result are not. 

MR. MITCHELL:  It's because the 

statute was written in 1934, and Congress wasn't 

thinking about bump stocks when they wrote this 

statute.

 understood your friend on the other side to 

focus on it more as maintaining pressure.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- which

 is it? I mean, do you hold it -- I mean, you 

have to hold it harder at certain points rather

 than others, or are you actually moving it with

 the thrusting? 

MR. MITCHELL:  You're definitely 

moving your hand back and forth. And Mr. 

Fletcher agreed with us on that point.  The hand 

is moving. 

I think where our disagreement comes 

in is that Mr. Fletcher seems to characterize 

the action of the non-shooting hand, so the left 

hand for a right-handed shooter, as something 

where you are applying constant pressure in a 

certain direction, but the recoil is strong 

enough to overcome that pressure from the 

non-shooting hand and thereby move the weapon 

backward, despite the forward pressure that's 

coming from the non-shooting hand.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that if a -- if a 

-- I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but that means 

that the way a shooter perceives it is by 

imposing constant forward pressure, not the 

shooter is thinking I got to do this really

 fast, you know, going back and forth.

 MR. MITCHELL:  The shooter can do

 both. And it takes a lot of practice to master 

the art of bump firing. So there is always 

going to be recoil energy, and no person, I 

think, is strong enough to push forward in a way 

that overcomes the recoil energy.  If they were, 

bump firing wouldn't happen. 

So, for successful bump firing to 

occur, there needs to be that back-and-forth 

motion.  There's recoil every time the rifle 

fires. There's still pressure from the left 

hand, or the right hand if you're a left-handed 

shooter.  There's still going to be pressure 

from that non-shooting hand, but the shooter can 

decide how much he wants to calibrate that 

pressure in response to the repeated recoils 

that he's getting from the bump firing. 

It doesn't have to be the same amount 

of pressure each time. The shooter just has to

 successful bump firing.

 But to get back to your question, Mr.

 Chief Justice, I --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the shooter 

doesn't make sure that the hand is moving back 

and forth. That's the way the recoil operates. 

The shooter just makes sure that he is pushing 

forward, and then the recoil -- recoil operates 

to, in fact, even though the shooter is not 

experiencing this --

MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is -- is not 

volitionally experiencing this, the shooter is 

not moving his hand back and forward. 

MR. MITCHELL:  That's probably right, 

unless the shooter is so strong that he has to 

ease off a little bit to make sure he doesn't 

overcome the recoil.  But, to my knowledge, I 

don't think there's anybody strong enough to 

make -- to actually be able to keep pushing and 

forcing it past the recoil energy. 

But, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think

because, even if we accept Mr. Fletcher's

 characterization where it's just constant

 pressure with the same amount of force 

continuously over a sustained period of time, 

it's still a manual action. There's nothing

 automatic about that.  The shooter is the one 

who is pushing. It's human effort, human 

exertion. Nothing automatic at all about this

 process. 

And Mr. Fletcher said during his 

remarks that the bump stock harnesses the recoil 

energy of the weapon.  That is false.  With the 

Akins Accelerator, there is harnessing because 

the Akins Accelerator has a spring.  So there 

will be certain types of bump-firing devices 

like the Akins Accelerator where you can 

accurately say that the bump stock harnesses the 

recoil energy of the weapon. 

Not so with respect to a 

non-mechanical bump stock.  The weapon recoils. 

Nothing is harnessed with respect to the recoil 

energy.  And it is the shooter who must, with 

that non-shooting hand, continue to thrust the 

weapon forward in response.

everything involved with Mr. Cargill's

 non-mechanical bump stock is a manual action 

undertaken entirely by the shooter.

 There is no automating device.  Mr. 

Fletcher has yet to identify any device in the

 non-mechanical bump stock that automates any 

task that is necessary for successful bump

 firing.  It is all being done by the shooter.

 There's the recoil after the shot gets 

fired, and then it is the shooter who must, with 

his own hand and with his own force, exert 

pressure forward consistently to make sure that 

the trigger bumps into his finger. This is all 

manual.  Nothing automatic about it.  Nothing at 

all. And the --

 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Box 1, the operator

 pushes the button and the bullets come out 

automatically. Box 2, the operator holds his

 finger slightly above the box, and there's 

something, you know, under the box that pushes

 the box up into his finger.  So the finger is 

touching the trigger like a million times 

because the -- in order for it to operate, the 

box is going like so --

is a machinegun, one is not. Same rate of --

MR. MITCHELL:  -- can the rationale of

 that case be extended to this hypothetical.

 So I think the way to think of this, 

Your Honor, is there are going to be easy cases 

at each of the extremes, and there are going to

 be harder cases in the middle.  The easy case is

 United States against Camp because that is a

 situation where the trigger was changed.  It no

 longer is the curved metal lever. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, right, right. 

MR. MITCHELL:  It's instead a switch. 

Everyone agrees with that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I guess -- and 

-- and your -- and your view is what makes it 

easy or hard is not the sort of thought of mine 

that, like, geez, what makes it easy or hard is 

actually distinguishing those two in the real 

world, like in terms of what is actually 

happening? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  You think what makes 

it easy or hard is just identifying whether the 

finger is -- is moving because the box is moving 

or because the person is pushing it down?

whether it's changed the nature of the trigger

 in some way. Clearly, that happened in Camp.

 This situation with Mr. Cargill, 

there's not even an argument that the trigger 

has been changed. DOJ at no point in this

 litigation has argued that bump stocks change 

the nature of the trigger or change the trigger

 at all.

 There will be harder cases in the 

middle, such as the forced reset triggers and 

some of these hypotheticals that were discussed 

in the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Guedes, where 

there may be a question as to what exactly the 

trigger is and then how does that trigger 

function. 

So, again, going back to Camp, when 

there's a flip of a switch that turns on a motor 

and that motor then forces the curved metal 

lever back and forth, that's automatic fire. 

That's a machinegun because we now have a new 

trigger, the switch.  It's no longer the curved 

metal lever. 

So can that rationale be extended to 

some of these hypotheticals where we talk about 

black boxes and oscillating buttons?  What

exactly is the trigger there? Is it merely the

 button?  Is it the motor that's moving the

 button up and down?  It's arguable either way. 

We don't think the Court should 

resolve any of that, I understand, but for us to 

take a position on the question, it's all going 

to depend on whether you can extend the holding 

of Camp to these new situations.

 The Akins Accelerator is a good 

example to think about because, in 2006, when 

ATF changed its position on the Akins 

Accelerator, ATF initially approved that device 

in 2002.  2006, it changed its mind. 

And if you look at the classification 

letter, their argument rests on an argument 

similar to what Mr. Fletcher is making today. 

They cite the legislative history from Karl 

Frederick and say that "function of the trigger" 

means "pull of the trigger."  That rationale is 

not going to work if the Akins Accelerator is 

going to be characterized as a machinegun. 

What might work, though, is if there's 

some possible argument to extend the holding of 

United States against Camp to the Akins 

Accelerator.  Does that spring in the Akins

That's the question that needs to be addressed.

 If ATF wants to continue to 

characterize the Akins Accelerator as a 

machinegun, it's going to need to come up with a 

much better argument than what it offered in

 2006. We're not closing the door on that 

possibility, but we do think the actual 

rationale that ATF has used is just as faulty as 

their rationale for banning non-mechanical bump 

stocks.

JUSTICE THOMAS: Mr. Mitchell, the --

I think we -- you would agree that the bump 

stock accelerates the rate of fire? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Absolutely. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Why wouldn't you then 

take the further step of saying it changes the 

nature of the trigger in doing that? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Because the trigger 

still has to reset after every single shot.

changing the trigger.  It's accelerating the

MR. MITCHELL:  I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So the -- why 

wouldn't you say that you have enhanced the

 triggering mechanism by using the bump stock?

 MR. MITCHELL:  Because it's not 

changing the triggering mechanism at all. It's 

simply making it easier for the shooter to bump 

that trigger repeatedly.  The nature of the 

triggering mechanism remains exactly the same. 

What's going on inside the gun after the trigger 

gets bumped is no different than what it would 

be if it were a semiautomatic rifle without the 

bump stock.  And that's why the government can't 

win on this "single function of the trigger" 

point.

the difference is that there may be some who

of the bump stock.  So, if that's changed, why

 changed?

 MR. MITCHELL:  What's changed, though,

 is the rate of fire. And it's still one shot 

per function of the trigger, even though those 

shots are coming out of the barrel a lot faster

 than they were before.  The question is, how

 many functions of the trigger do we have for 

each of the shots? 

And the answer is one. If you divide 

the number of shots that are fired from a bump 

stock equipped rifle by the number of times the 

trigger has to function to produce that shot, 

the answer will always be one, and it will 

remain that way because nothing in the 

triggering mechanism has changed.

Church of the Holy Trinity case?

 MR. MITCHELL:  I would say it's quite

 as egregious as Church of the Holy Trinity, but 

the arguments the government's making are 

certainly in the spirit of Holy Trinity, to

 borrow a phrase that was used from the Holy 

Trinity opinion, and I don't think a textualist

 judge can accept the rationale that's being 

offered by the U.S. Government and they are in 

their brief especially making purposivist 

arguments along the lines of what we saw in 

Church of the Holy Trinity. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Sotomayor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why would even a

they needed to shoot 400 to 7- or 800 rounds of

magazine after every round. We allow large

 capacity magazines up to 50.

Counsel, you spoke about legislative history and

classic legislative history.  It's how people

 than pull triggers.  And the Solicitor General 

acknowledges this point in her opening brief. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well -- well, that 

-- what it suggests to me is that contrary to 

what you're saying, that is they never

 understood this to be how the trigger functions 

but how the shooter functions.

 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I think we should 

draw the exact opposite inference.  It proves 

how unreliable legislative history is as a tool 

to try to discern what the statute means --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're going to 

disagree. 

MR. MITCHELL:  -- because -- well, 

it's because, Justice Sotomayor, the phrase 

"pull of the trigger" can't be equated with 

"function of the trigger."  And even the 

Solicitor General acknowledges that because they 

say in their brief that the statute needs to be 

read in a way that encompasses fully automatic 

weapons that have push triggers rather than 

triggers that are pulled.  So the word 

"function" --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and you

 agree?

 MR. MITCHELL:  I agree that function

 can't be equated with the word "pull."

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the only way 

you can get there is by looking at what the

 shooter is doing.

 MR. MITCHELL:  No, that's not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay, counsel. 

Thank you. 

MR. MITCHELL:  -- correct.  You don't 

need to look at what the shooter is doing.  A 

weapon can go off by accident.  You don't need a 

shooter.  There's still a function of the 

trigger if the weapon falls on to the floor and 

goes off accidentally with a discharge.  The 

trigger has functioned even though the shooter 

hasn't pulled the trigger or pushed it or bumped 

it. What matters under the statute is what the 

trigger does.

bat" or "stroke of the key" or "roll of the 

dice," all of those are transitive verbs that 

are capable of taking an object.

 So, when you see "swing of the bat," 

there's obviously an unnamed actor in that 

sentence that is the subject of the verb

 "swing."  The bat can't swing itself.  The bat's

 an inanimate object.

 Function of the trigger is entirely 

different. Function is an intransitive verb. 

It can't take an object grammatically.  It's 

impossible.  Trigger has to be the subject of 

function.  It can't be the object.

I don't want to ignore that.  But it -- it seems 

as if you look at the entire phrase, what that

barrel, right, more than one shot, it wanted to 

de-link that from a discrete human action.

you're saying, well, maybe they didn't define 

the bump stock as the trigger, but -- but it --

it functions in precisely the same way.

 And a torrent of bullets comes out, 

and this is in the heartland of what they were

 concerned about, which is anything that takes

 just a little human action to produce more than 

one shot is what they were getting at.

 MR. MITCHELL:  That's just not the way 

they wrote the statute.  If that's what they 

were getting at, they should have drafted the 

statute --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Shoot --

MR. MITCHELL:  -- better than what 

they did.  I mean, it depends on whether more 

than one shot is coming out by a single function 

of the trigger. 

And I agree with Your Honor, there --

the rate of fire of a bump stock equipped rifle 

approaches the rate of fire of a fully automatic 

weapon.  And there may be good policy reasons to 

treat these as identical. 

There may also be good policy reasons

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, Mr. Mitchell,

 I will tell you I -- I view myself as a good

 textualist.  I think that that's the way we 

should think about statutes. It's by reading

 them.

 But, you know, textualism is not 

inconsistent with common sense.  Like, at some 

point, you have to apply a little bit of common 

sense to the way you read a statute and 

understand that what this statute comprehends is 

a weapon that fires a multitude of shots with a 

single human action. 

Whether it's a continuous pressure on 

a -- a -- a conventional machinegun holding the 

trigger or a continuous pressure on one of these 

devices on the barrel, I -- I can't understand 

how anybody could think that those two things 

should be treated differently. 

MR. MITCHELL:  Well, they're treated 

differently because the statute turns on a 

single function of the trigger.  And the problem 

for the government is they're not able to change

the nature of the trigger that currently exists 

on a semiautomatic rifle simply by adding a bump 

stock, which is nothing more than a casing that 

allows the rifle to side slide back and forth.

 The trigger is exactly the same as 

what it was before, and the function of the 

trigger is exactly the same as what it was

 before.

 I mean, think of a semiautomatic rifle 

where someone just has a very quick trigger 

finger.  That could also have a very, very high 

rate of fire, but it's still one shot per 

function of the trigger. 

And that's the problem here the 

government still is not able to overcome.  Every 

time that trigger functions inside a bump stock 

equipped rifle, there is one shot and only one 

shot that gets fired, even though there may be 

rapid functions that occur consecutively because 

of the bump stock-equipped device.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: In response to a 

lot of the questions, you've made the point that 

bump stocks were not around as of 1934. And

 that's a -- a good point for you.

 But what evidence is there, if any, 

that as of 1934, the ordinary understanding of 

the phrase "function of the trigger" referred to 

the mechanics of the gun rather than the -- the

 shooter's motion? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Well, it had to.  And 

the evidence that we can see is the evidence the 

Solicitor General points out about the fact that 

there were push triggers in existence at that 

time. 

And that function of the trigger, even 

though you can find legislative history where 

there seem to be people who think "function of 

the trigger" means the same thing as "pull of 

the trigger," those phrases cannot be equated 

for that very reason.

 MR. MITCHELL:  Drawing the distinction

 between push and pull or --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No.  The

 distinction between function -- that "function

 of the trigger" meant something different.

 MR. MITCHELL:  I'm not aware of that 

in the legislative history, but as a textualist 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Are you aware of 

that anywhere in kind of communication at the 

time? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Not at the time, no, 

because the communication, as we can see from 

the record, was rather sloppy.  People were 

using "pull of the trigger" as a phrase that 

they thought was synonymous with "function of 

the trigger." 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I guess --

MR. MITCHELL:  And that obviously is 

not the case. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So no one 

that was saying, oh, "function of the trigger," 

that's a different phrase than "pull or push" 

and, therefore, it means something different?

capture some other things, but those other 

things would be similar enough to bump stocks

 well, which they --

MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah.

Okay. Last question.  You haven't made a Second 

Amendment or constitutional avoidance argument. 

In your view, are bump stocks covered by the 

Second Amendment, protected by the Second 

Amendment? 

MR. MITCHELL:  We didn't argue that 

because courts are generally loath to decide 

constitutional questions when there's an easy 

statutory off-ramp. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You didn't throw 

it in as constitutional avoidance, and I imagine 

that was a considered choice, and I'm curious 

what -- what was behind that choice.

 Amendment issue because there is a question at

 least whether this falls within the "dangerous

 We don't have a position on that 

question because we didn't brief it, and also 

"dangerous and unusual weapons" is vague enough 

that it's just not clear to us what the answer

 would be.

So why couldn't we read the words 

"function of the trigger" in this statute to 

mean the function of the trigger is to start a 

chemical reaction that leads to the expulsion of 

a projectile?  If I read "function of the 

trigger in that way," I think I come out to a 

different result than you are positing.  So help

MR. MITCHELL:  And it's more than just

 the movement.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I'm saying what 

the trigger does, both in this case, in a bump

 stock case, and in a machinegun case, is to

 start a -- chemical reaction that leads to the

 expulsion of a projectile.

 MR. MITCHELL:  There --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So --

MR. MITCHELL:  -- there are other

part. What the trigger does, it releases the

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Some weapons might 

do it by moving back and forth quickly, by the 

mechanics of the gun operating in a certain way.

 Others might do it by the mechanics of the gun

 operating in a different way.

 But I could say that the function is 

to begin the chemical reaction that results in

 the expulsion of this weapon, and that happens 

both in the bump stop -- stock situation and in 

this situation.  So I don't understand why this 

statute couldn't be read as -- the -- the way 

that the government is. 

MR. MITCHELL:  Even if -- even if you 

read the statute that way, Your Honor, I don't 

see how that wins the case for the government 

because --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why not? 

MR. MITCHELL:  Because only one shot 

is being fired per function of the trigger. So

multiple shots.  You can't forget the rest of

MR. MITCHELL:  Certainly not. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, when we put 

those together, the work of the function of the 

trigger, I think, could be to start the chemical 

reaction that then results in the automatic 

shoot -- more -- more than one shot coming out 

of the gun.  Why can't I interpret it that way?

actually were happening, then I think you would

 sweeping in all kinds of things, things that

 originally was -- weren't designed to work this

 way at all, right?  We're -- we're -- we're 

allowing for machineguns to include things that

 can modify something that didn't operate this 

way at all into a machine -- into the kind of

 thing where a chemical reaction kicks it off and 

it automatically fires more than one shot.

 If that's what I'm thinking about, 

then I guess I don't understand your hang-up

MR. MITCHELL:  Well, the test under 

the statute is whether it can be readily 

restored to fire automatically more than one 

shot by a single function of the trigger.  It's 

not whether it can be modified to fire 

automatically more than one function of the

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mm-hmm.  Yes.

 MR. MITCHELL:  -- it's factually

 incorrect to say that a function of the trigger

 automatically starts some chain reaction that

 propels multiple bullets from the gun. A

 function of the trigger fires one shot. Then

 the shooter must take additional manual action.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I -- I understand --

MR. MITCHELL:  All right?  So there's 

no --

thing as a machinegun and is basically just as

 dangerous as a machinegun.

 But his argument is the words that 

Congress wrote in 1934 just don't cover it 

because the words "single function of a trigger" 

unambiguously refers to the movement or the 

mechanics of the trigger, without regard to the

 action of the shooter.

 We are not making a Holy Trinity 

argument.  If that is what the words meant, then 

we would be stuck with the words. We are not 

asking you to depart from the plain language. 

We're asking you to give it its natural reading. 

And I think, it -- to understand why 

the statute not only can be but should be read 

our way, it's worth thinking about how many 

people you have to disagree with in order to 

adopt my friend's reading. 

So, first of all, on the grammar, 

Judge Ho, at page 56a of the Petition Appendix, 

explains why it's perfectly natural to read 

"function of the trigger" to refer to what the 

shooter does to the trigger, not to what the 

trigger does by itself.

 about contemporaneous usage.  There's a lot of

 contemporaneous usage of people using the term

 "pull of the trigger" to be synonymous with

 "function of the trigger."  That makes perfect 

sense if we're talking about what the shooter

 does, because the way the shooter activates

 most, not all, but most triggers is by pulling

 on them.

 But I think my friend conceded that 

usage is all inconsistent with his reading.  And 

as you pointed out, there is no evidence that 

anyone at the time or ever since, until the 

development of devices like these, ever thought 

that "function of a trigger" meant mechanical 

movement independent of any action by the 

shooter. 

It's also worth emphasizing that even 

if you looked at what the trigger does by 

itself, what the trigger does is accept some 

input by the shooter. 

Justice Kagan, you asked about what 

about a voice-activated trigger? You could also 

have a trigger that works by swiping a 

touchscreen.  Those triggers don't necessarily 

have any moving parts.

On our understanding, we say, is there

 an act of the trigger that -- of the shooter

 that initiates the firing sequence, a spoken 

command, a swipe on the touchscreen, it works

 perfectly.

 On my friend's understanding, I have 

no idea how he would deal with a firearm that

 had a trigger that did not have moving parts.

 We've also talked some about 

automatically, and I take my friend's point to 

be that he thinks because there's some continued 

manual input, the pushing forward, it can't be 

automatic.  But automatic just means by way of a 

self-regulating mechanism.  It doesn't mean it 

eliminates all manual input.  It just means that 

it eliminates some of it. 

And contrary to what my friend said, a 

bump stock does eliminate manual action that the 

shooter has to take.  With a semiautomatic 

weapon, you have to pull and release the trigger 

with each shot.  With an auto -- with a bump 

stock the bump stock allows the recoil from each 

shot to automatically push the rifle back, 

disengaging the trigger, eliminating the need 

for the shooter to manually release, and then it

exactly the right way to allow a continuous

 firing cycle to continue.

 Now I think it's also telling, some of 

the gymnastics with respect that my friend has 

to do in order to deal with all of the other 

hypothetical and actual devices that have been 

out there because I think he recognizes that the

 Akins Accelerator, the LV 15, the electronic 

reset assist device, the fishing reel in Camp, 

all of these workarounds have to be covered by 

the statute because it's just not plausible to 

think that Congress enacted something subject to 

such easy evasion. 

But the only way he can say that those 

are covered is by engaging in very implausible 

understandings of what the trigger is. I think, 

for the Akins Accelerator, he suggested that 

maybe the trigger is the spring in the back of 

the rifle rather than the lever that the -- the 

shooter actually pulls to start the firing 

sequence. 

On the black-box hypothetical, I'm 

still not sure what his answer is, but I think 

it must be that the button is the trigger the

first time it moves up and down, but then it 

stops being the trigger when it keeps moving up

 and down afterwards.

 I think those are all very implausible

 interpretations that this Court should not give 

to a statute if there's another reading

 available, and our view is that there is another

 reading available.

 In short, we think Congress in 1934 

wrote this statute not just for the kinds of 

devices that existed then but for other kinds of 

devices that could be created in the future that 

would do the same thing. 

It enacted and strengthened these laws 

because it did not want members of the public or 

our nation's law enforcement officers to face 

the danger from weapons that let a shooter spray 

many bullets by making a single act. 

That's exactly what bump stocks do, as 

the Las Vegas shooting vividly illustrated, and 

we think this Court should give the words 

Congress wrote their full, natural meaning and 

hold that they encompass bump stocks. 

Thank you.
