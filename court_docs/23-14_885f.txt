 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23-14, Diaz

 versus United States. 

Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The Ninth Circuit holds that Rule 

704(b) prohibits only explicit opinions that the 

"particular defendant had the state of mind 

required to convict." The government appears 

unwilling to endorse that full test.  It seems 

to agree, contrary to Ninth Circuit precedent, 

that Rule 704(b) forbids an expert from 

testifying that people in the defendant's 

position always have the requisite mens rea. 

Such testimony never explicitly 

mentions the defendant, of course, but as the 

government seems to recognize, it is clearly in 

the rules of -- in the words of Rule 704(b) an 

opinion about whether the defendant had the 

requisite state of mind.  In other words, it

establishes a class of individuals including the 

defendant, and it assigns a mens rea to that

 class. 

Agent Flood's testimony here was no

 different.  He testified that in "most 

circumstances," people like the defendant know 

they have drugs in the car when they cross the

 border.  The only difference between that

 testimony and absolute class-wide testimony is 

that he posited that people like the defendant 

usually, instead of always, have the requisite 

mens rea. 

But any such distinction is 

immaterial.  Imagine an expert took the stand 

and said:  I believe the defendant in this case 

probably or maybe 80 percent of the time -- or 

maybe there's an 80 percent likelihood had the 

requisite mens rea.  Obviously, Rule 704(b) 

would prohibit that testimony. 

And the testimony here is exactly the 

same. It expresses an opinion, a probabilistic 

opinion instead of an absolute opinion, but an 

opinion about whether the defendant had the 

requisite -- requisite mens rea. 

So that leaves the government's final

 objection, that Rule 704(b) should not be

 construed to prohibit what the government calls

 "inferentially relevant testimony."

 And we agree with that proposition. 

The rule that I'm advocating today has been

 employed by the Fifth Circuit for over 20 years, 

and it makes clear that modus operandi evidence, 

for example, things like drug traffic

 organizations use couriers to transport drugs 

across the border, that they -- that drugs are 

extremely valuable, are perfectly legitimate. 

The rule in the Fifth Circuit is that 

testimony from which a jury might infer mens rea 

is perfectly permissible, but testimony that 

assigns a mens rea to the defendant or people in 

her class is not okay. And that's what Agent 

Flood did here, and for that reason, we'd ask 

the Court to reverse. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Fisher, you put 

quite a bit of weight -- of -- of weight in your 

argument on the preposition -- on "about."  And 

that was a stylistic change, certainly 

non-substantive. 

Do we normally put that much emphasis 

or that much weight on stylistic changes to

 statutes?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think what I

 would say, Justice Thomas, is the Court 

obviously puts a lot of weight on the text of 

the statute. And so I start with the current 

text of the statute that is current law.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. So, even with

 that, it says "about defendant." It doesn't say

 "about" someone else.  So you're saying that 

even if it's indirect, it's about this 

defendant? 

MR. FISHER: Let me say two things, 

Justice Thomas.  First, to finish my answer 

about the word "about," what we say is that 

preposition is important, just like the prior 

preposition, "as to," before the stylistic 

amendment --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MR. FISHER: -- because it makes clear 

the Ninth Circuit's clear statement rule 

requiring an explicit opinion is too narrow.  So 

that's what the preposition "about" does. 

Now you also asked me about "the" 

defendant.  And our position there is very 

simple.  It is that that word covers either a

direct statement about the particular defendant 

or a statement about a class of people,

 including the defendant.

 I don't think the government disagrees

 that the rule covers a statement covering -- I'm

 sorry, that -- that the rule covers a class of 

people including the defendant as long as it's

 stated in absolute terms.  So, if I understand

 the government's position correctly, it agrees 

you need not mention the explicit defendant.  If 

you talk about a class of people that includes 

the defendant and say those people always have 

the requisite mens rea, I think the government 

agrees, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, that Rule 

704(b) applies. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I thought 

the --

MR. FISHER: And all we're saying --

sorry. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I thought the 

argument there was that if you say "all 

defendants," all people in this class do this, 

then it obviously would include the defendant. 

MR. FISHER: I think that's exactly 

right, Justice Thomas.  So the only move left

from there is to say, if the expert were to 

testify people like this almost always, 

virtually always, 99 percent of the time,

 probably, in most circumstances, all of those

 are still opinions about whether the defendant 

had the mens rea. They're just not absolute

 opinions.

 But they're still stating an opinion

 about whether a class of people including this 

defendant have the requisite mens rea. And I 

think that's why the text of the rule, opinions 

about whether the defendant had the mens rea, 

covers this exact case.

his testimony before.  And so, after he has 

testified, he could presumably stand up and ask

 the expert, you know, Mr. Expert, are you saying

 that in every case, someone knows that the drugs

 are in the car?  He, presumably, would say no. 

And are you saying -- are you stating an opinion

 about whether this individual had -- knew she 

had drugs in the car? He would have to say no,

 right? 

So I don't understand -- I mean, 

obviously, you would like a case in which this 

was a very rare occurrence, but all he's saying 

is that it's not.  It's whatever he wants to 

say, in the majority of cases or whatever, and 

you can challenge that and you can particularly 

make clear that what the concern was about in --

in drafting this rule, you can make clear that 

he is not telling you anything about this 

particular individual. 

MR. FISHER: Let me say two things 

about that, Mr. Chief Justice.  First of all, I 

just want to return to the thing I said in the 

opening, which is, if the expert were to testify 

that I think there's an 80 percent chance this 

particular defendant had the mens rea, the same

would say, Mr. Expert, you're not sure, are you?

 It's possible he didn't have it? Only -- you

 know, it's only you're saying probably?  And I 

think it would be very hard to argue Rule 704(b)

 would not cover that testimony.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't

 think --

MR. FISHER: And the reason why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

MR. FISHER: Oh.  I think the reason 

why is because what the drafters of the rule 

cared about was not an absolute versus 

probabilistic opinion.  What they cared about 

was the expert assigning a mens rea to the 

defendant or a class of people like the 

defendant.  In other words, it's the subject of 

mens rea that's off limits, not --

before Rule 704(b), an expert could say -- for 

example, an expert could say, absolutely, as 

happened in the Hinckley trial, I believe this 

defendant did not have the capacity to tell 

right from wrong, so, therefore, he is insane. 

And I think after -- and I'd think

insane and couldn't tell right from wrong.

 And whether you say that in terms of a 

percentage or just a verbal locution that's 

"probably," "usually," "most of the time," 

"almost certainly," any of those things would be 

covered by the rule because they're all an

 opinion about whether the defendant had that

 mens rea.

understand it. If you don't think that anything 

from which the jury could infer mens rea is 

barred -- by 704, then I don't know where you 

draw the line.

to decide in this case if I give you a quick 

preface to that answer.

understand as expressing an opinion about the 

defendant's mens rea is covered by Rule 704(b).

MR. FISHER: That raises --

have personal familiarity with in which a person 

drove across the border with a large quantity of 

drugs hidden in the car?  Eighty-three cases. 

And how many of those cases did the person 

driving the car know that the drugs were there? 

Eighty-three. 

Is that barred? 

MR. FISHER: I -- I think that would 

be barred because it would be equivalent of 

saying defendants in this position always have 

the requisite mens rea.

But, Justice Alito, let me -- I think it might 

help the conversation if I explained the Ninth 

Circuit's rule raises really two questions. 

One is, is the expert testimony about 

mens rea and is it about the defendant?  And --

and -- and we agree with the -- with the Fifth 

Circuit rule that if you -- if the expert gives 

testimony that -- from which the jury can merely 

draw an inference about mens rea, that's 

perfectly fine, and there might be borderline 

cases about what's mens rea, but that's not this 

case because the expert used the word "know." 

The expert used the word "aware."

exact same testimony can come in. 

MR. FISHER: So let me say the rule 

and the reason why I gave you the answer I did. 

Remember, the rule talks about not just any 

mental state or not facts that might lead to a 

mental state, but it talks about the mental 

state of the crime -- of the element of the 

crime to convict. 

So, here, the -- that mental state is

 said. In your hypothetical, you have to know

 not just that the ex -- that the defendant was 

told that but that she heard it, she understood 

it, she remembered it, she wasn't told something

 different --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  How about if I

MR. FISHER: -- all kinds of those. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- how about if I said 

something like, in my experience, the -- the --

the organization always informs the courier of 

the nature of the scheme and doesn't allow the 

courier to set off until she verbally assents? 

MR. FISHER: Right.  I think, at some 

point, you get so close that that may well be a 

statement about mens rea.  But what I want to 

emphasize, Justice Kagan --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess what I'm 

suggesting -- and it's really the same point 

that Justice Alito was making, I think -- is 

that it just seems at that point a -- a kind of

it falls just over the line, you know, or, 

instead, you can argue that it's just inside the

get this testimony in.

 MR. FISHER: Well, if you think that's 

too formalistic, you could, of course, make the

 rule broader.  All I'm saying is that there is a 

core of Rule 704(b) which is statements about

 the defendant's mens rea, and that's 

unquestionably what you have in this case. And 

how far out that goes and whether it covers your 

hypothetical would just be a different case on 

different facts. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why is your 

statement --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  What about --

MR. FISHER: But it has to mean 

something. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- what about your 

own -- oh, sorry. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why is it a 

statement about the defendant's mens rea? 

That's the part that I'm not understanding.  So, 

you know, the Chief says, if the expert in a 

situation says 80 percent of the time, you know, 

when these conditions exist, the person knows.

know about it?

me --

as that, then the question is still whether the

MR. FISHER: Well, I think, you know, 

that's one way to put it, but I think, Justice 

Jackson, imagine the expert testified:  I think 

there's an 80 percent chance or I think probably 

this particular defendant knew she had drugs in 

the car.

of inferential analysis if you want to put it 

that way to be done by the jury, but it's not

 inference as to mens rea.  It's just inference 

as to whether or not the defendant is guilty or

 not. It's still a probabilistic opinion.

 So I think the only thing I want to 

persuade you of is that just like an expert 

giving a probabilistic opinion about the

 defendant herself leaves, if you want to put it 

this way, some room for the jury to confirm that 

that expert is correct that this defendant is 

one of the majority, the same thing would be 

true if the expert said the thing about the 

defendant herself. 

And -- and convert -- and -- and the 

other version of this, I think, that helps prove 

my point is that, I think, again -- and I'll let 

my -- my friend speak for himself -- but I think 

I understand the government to say that if the 

defendant says -- if the expert says people like 

this always know they have drugs in the car, 

that's covered by Rule 704(b). 

Now that's contrary to Ninth Circuit 

precedent and it doesn't explicitly mention the 

defendant, but it is covered.  And so, if you

an exception in 704.

 MR. FISHER: So let me go through both

 the rules you mentioned, Justice Alito.  Under

 Rule 702, I think the reason why that evidence

 typically comes in is the expert couches it as

 "in my experience."  And to go back to your 

hypothetical, in my experience, 83 out of 83, 

therefore, people always know.

 And we cite cases in our brief where 

the expert has given this exact kind of 

testimony up to 2013 in the Ninth Circuit, so --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I mean, the --

the fact testimony, 83 out of 83, is one thing. 

Whether it's permissible to draw from that 

experience the inference that they always know, 

I think that's dubious under 702. 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think you're -- I 

-- I think you may be right. The NACDL brief 

talks about some of the problems with law 

enforcement expert testimony that exist sort of 

writ large across the courts, and maybe Rule --

maybe you have a Rule 702 case that you might 

want to look at sometime when it comes to that 

problem.  But I don't think you need to do that 

here because Rule 704(b) is the finer-grained

more thing -- even if there were just one 

expert, if you do want to look at congressional 

intent, what that intent is clear about is that 

experts should not be talking about the ultimate

 issue of mens rea.  It's perfectly fine to talk

 about mental state.  It's perfectly talk about 

-- fine about experiential facts that lend to 

inferences about mental state. But the jury's

 special role in criminal cases is designed to 

find mental state in expert --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But what about --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and then just to 

-- just to finish up, you know, the -- the --

the fact that the parties can often get 

inferences through facts about mens rea and 

therefore come virtually close to this, is that 

anything unusual in -- in -- in trial practice? 

I -- I was always taught there's always a way to 

skin the evidentiary cat, and I can come up with 

a whole bunch of facts that -- to suggest that 

somebody does or doesn't have a mental state. 

MR. FISHER: Yeah, that's exactly 

right. And, of course, the prosecutor at 

closing can connect all of the dots and make an

 argument to the jury.  So I'm not here to make a 

big dramatic argument, but I am here to make a

 meaningful argument about testimony that's this 

explicit about the defendant's mens rea.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, that --

actually, Justice Gorsuch's question brings up 

one that I had, is what about your client's own 

expert testimony in this case, you know, an 

expert who says there's no way for someone to 

suspect or know that the car has drugs in it? 

MR. FISHER: So I think, Justice 

Barrett, that particular sentence of our 

expert's testimony crossed the line of Rule 

704(b), but, remember, the trial judge had 

already ruled at that point that Agent Flood's 

testimony was admissible and had construed the 

rule in the way the Ninth Circuit does to bar 

only explicit opinions about the defendant 

herself.  So the defendant was playing under the 

same rules that the prosecution was playing 

under. 

We agree on a retrial that that 

particular statement would be out. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  That that would have 

to stay out?  And what about framework evidence,

that the evidence professors say framework 

evidence is valuable and it comes in in most 

cases, and, you know, your average juror is

 probably not going to understand how cartels

 work? So it would be valuable, I would think,

 to say things like, well, you know, cartels like

 to know where the parked -- car is going to be 

parked on the other side of the border so they

 know where to find the drugs.  This is the value 

of the drugs.  So this is how cartels --

MR. FISHER: Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- do it. So the 

evidence professors say this would be a terrible 

rule because framework evidence is valuable. 

Do you -- what rule do you see for the 

kind of framework evidence? 

MR. FISHER: I think the -- the 

professors just misunderstand our rule. And 

we're, again, are -- not advocating something 

out of thin air.  It's the Fifth Circuit's own 

doctrine that we're -- that we're advocating 

here. And that doctrine makes clear all the 

stuff you just posited is perfectly admissible

 that make it highly likely or unlikely a person 

had a mens rea, but it's not statements about

 knowledge to use the mens rea in this case.

 And -- and this brings me back --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, Mr. -- Mr.

 Fisher --

MR. FISHER: -- to Justice Kagan --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- Mr. Fisher, 

sometimes statements about knowledge are 

actually defense important.  You suggested that 

in this case the defense put that evidence in 

sort of because they were living in the world 

that the court had already established. 

But one of the things the evidence 

professors talk about is that if you exclude 

this kind of evidence, you could have a 

situation in which you have a battered spouse 

who assaults their -- the person who is beating 

them, and they're not going to be able to put on 

expert evidence that negates mens rea in that 

situation. 

What do you say about that?  It seems 

to me this is not all net positive for defense. 

MR. FISHER: So I think this is the

flip side of the exchange I had with Justice 

Gorsuch. The defendant in that situation can 

put on an expert to talk about the phenomenon of

 battered women syndrome.  That expert could 

testify about the cycle of violence and learned

 helplessness and the features of battered women

 syndrome.

 The only thing the expert could not do 

is say: I think this defendant or people in her 

position would not have had the requisite mens 

rea. But then, at closing, the defendant can 

make that very argument. 

It's just direct -- testimony about 

the precise element of the climb -- crime that 

is barred, the mens rea element of the crime 

that is barred, by Rule 704(b).  So, again, I 

don't have some broad --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But is there a 

difference between saying the defendant herself 

didn't have the mens rea or women in this 

situation didn't have the mens rea?  I guess 

that's what I'm not understanding about your 

argument.

 But I thought that's what you just said they

 could get up to the line of saying.

 MR. FISHER: No, no, no.  I think they 

-- they could describe women in the situation of

 battered women -- of battered women syndrome and 

what those symptoms are and what those features

 are of that -- of that condition, but the expert 

could not testify as to whether or not a person 

with that condition would have had the mens rea 

to commit this crime.  It's just the mens rea 

testimony.  It's not mental state testimony, 

mental condition testimony more generally. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, I -- I 

want to articulate your rule.  And you're right, 

it's different.  But you keep saying it's the 

Fifth Circuit rule.  I'm not sure it's the Fifth 

Circuit rule, because the Fifth Circuit has 

criticized evidence with respect to what the 

drug traffic -- the drug cartels' knowledge are. 

So I think you're breaking from the Fifth 

Circuit, as the government breaks from the Ninth 

Circuit.  Everybody's trying to find that happy 

medium.

of drug traffickers generally, but you can't 

talk about a particular defendant or class of 

defendants and what their mental state is 

because that's what the rule tells you you can't 

do. 

So it might feel like an exercise 

without a point, but it is an important point. 

Isn't that what you're trying to say? 

MR. FISHER:  I think that's right.  I 

think we are defending pretty much what happens 

in the Fifth Circuit. And the reason why that's 

the rule is because of the importance of mens

highlighted in cases in recent years, it is the

 heart of our criminal law and -- and it's the 

heart of a jury's function to make that

 moralistic qualitative determination.

 So, if it seems formalistic when I say 

you're drawing a line, a protective barrier 

around mens rea, it's because that's what the 

right of jury trial is about and that's what the 

drafters of this rule recognized after they get 

to --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Fisher --

MR. FISHER: -- trial. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- has the federal 

government had any trouble convicting drug 

traffickers in the Fifth Circuit? 

MR. FISHER: Not to my knowledge. 

And, of course, the government's had 20 years to 

bring this issue up if it didn't like the Fifth 

Circuit law. So I think it works pretty well in 

the Fifth Circuit. 

But let me say something that would 

lead -- if you agreed with the government's 

concession now that -- saying that people in 

this position always have the requisite mens

 difficult lines.  What if the expert testified

 and said people like this virtually always,

 99 percent of the time?  What if the expert said

 maybe it's hypothetically possible a

 defendant -- take the 83 out of 83, and the

 expert said maybe, maybe it's possible somebody

 could not have known, but I've never seen such a

 case? You know, would that count?  What if the 

expert said, like in this case, there's only 

three situations I can -- I'm aware of where an 

expert -- I'm sorry -- where the defendant 

doesn't have the mens rea and those three 

situations are all different from this case. 

And then take it one step further in 

closing argument when defense counsel tried to 

argue, well, Agent Flood admitted there's a few 

situations defendants don't have the mens rea. 

The government objected and said, well, you 

can't argue that other situations might be 

possible because, here, you named three. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But those all sound --

those all sound to me like cases in which Rule 

403 might well come into play.

 Ninth Circuit says about Rule 403 and Rule 401 

is that this testimony goes to the heart of a

 blind mule defense, like in this case.  So it's

 the exact opposite of being irrelevant or unduly

 prejudicial. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it's -- well, 

it's relevant, but it -- it has a highly 

prejudicial value and maybe it would be excluded 

by a lot of trial judges or --

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think -- I think 

the government's position is in line with the 

Ninth Circuit, and we concede there's force to 

it, that this evidence is damaging because it's 

so directly relevant to the defendant's mens 

rea. That's the problem with it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

Justice Thomas? 

Justice Alito, anything further? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- Justice Alito 

is inviting, I think, even more chaos in the --

among courts.  If you're going to rely on 403 or 

702 or any individualized decision-making by 

judges, you're just throwing this up into the 

air with no clarity.

MR. FISHER: I think that's right,

 Justice Sotomayor.  One way to think about this 

is you have Rule 403, which is maybe the 

broadest, most flexible of the Rules of Evidence 

to deal with prejudicial evidence. You have the

 next narrower rule, which is Rule 702, which is 

just about expert evidence and reliable bases

 for that evidence.  And then you have the 

narrowest of them all, Rule 704(b). 

I'm only asking you today to rule --

to apply Rule 704(b), which is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, once --

once you're asking courts to go into asking 

every police officer how many of these cases 

have you had, and when am I going to decide that 

10 cases is not adequate, but 83 might be? 

MR. FISHER: Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When there's 

550,000 drug arrests, is 83 enough?  I don't 

know the statistical answer to that. 

Your rule is much simpler, isn't it? 

MR. FISHER: I think it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's, if you're 

going to talk about a defendant and what a 

defendant is thinking, that's off limits; if

you're talking about modus operandi of what

 others do or don't do, that's okay?

 MR. FISHER: Right.  So my rule has 

two components. One is, is it about mens rea? 

Unquestionably yes here because the expert used 

the word "know." And is it about the defendant? 

And our rule there is very simple as well, 

directly about the defendant or a class of

 people including her. That's the full scope of 

that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the -- what is 

permissible, as you said, is if a expert says, 

drug traffickers prefer to hire people that the 

traffickers know and trust than to hide the 

drugs in a stranger car, or drug traffickers 

want to know where the car goes, so they're 

going to use a GPS or something like that. 

That's modus operandi. 

MR. FISHER: Descriptive modus 

operandi evidence that does not speak to mens 

rea directly is perfectly fine. 

And I -- and Justice Sotomayor, let me 

add one thing to what you were talking about 

because I think it goes back to the Chief 

Justice's question about cross-examination and

 maybe Justice Alito's question about Rule 702 as

 well.

 If the expert testified either -- on 

direct or cross, look, this is my experience 

across most cases, but I can't tell you anything

 about this particular defendant because I don't 

know anything about this defendant, whether or 

not she had the mens rea, then you would have a 

real objection under relevance or Rule 702. 

Of course, you had nothing like that 

in this case, you know, so the plain implication 

to the jury was not just most people like this 

have the mens rea, but I believe this defendant 

has the mens rea.

 courtroom has the mens rea.

 It is a class of people that 

necessarily includes the defendant. 

So there's really only two things you 

have to decide in this case, Justice Kagan. 

That's the first thing, is that when you move

 from the defendant to a class of people

 including the defendant, whether you're still 

within 704(b), the answer is yes. 

And the second question is whether, if 

that opinion is stated in probabilistic terms 

instead of absolute terms, you're still within 

704(b).  We say yes.  At that point, you're done 

and you can leave for another day modus operandi 

versus direct statements of mens rea because, 

you know, you have a direct statement of mens 

rea here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Just wanted to 

explore a little bit further your response to 

the Chief Justice. 

The 80 percent, he comes in and 

testifies 80 percent know but admits that he 

doesn't know about the defendant.

How is that evidence in court in the

 first place?

 MR. FISHER: That -- that's what I was 

trying to say, Justice Gorsuch. I think that if

 the -- if the expert disclaimed any knowledge

 whatsoever about this defendant and -- and any

 inference that might be drawn from his overall 

experience or from his probabilistic opinion, 

then I think the defense counsel would rise to 

object and have a very good ground to exclude 

that opinion. 

But that's not what happens here. 

It's the only reason --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Whether it comes out 

on direct or cross, it wouldn't make any 

difference. 

MR. FISHER: That's right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  He shouldn't be in 

court. 

MR. FISHER: The only reason the 

government is offering this testimony is because 

the expert is implicitly saying: I believe this 

defendant probably falls within the group. 

There's no disclaimer here that the expert is 

offering.  And that's the whole point of the

 testimony.  And if -- and if --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So, if we're --

MR. FISHER: -- if I could say one

 other thing, Justice Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Please. 

MR. FISHER: That is underscored by --

by Agent Flood's answers on cross-examination 

that there's only three possibilities that I'm 

aware of where the defendant does not know they 

have drugs, and those possibilities are all 

different from this case. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

MR. FISHER: So, when you add that all 

up, the expert is effectively saying not just 

most people but this person by logical 

implication knew she had drugs. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Correct.  And --

and -- and so, in this case, the only 

implication is she knew.  In the other cases 

we've been discussing, the 80 percent --

MR. FISHER: Right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and I don't know, 

then you've got a Daubert problem possibly and 

we're going to have to tackle that in the next 

case.

MR. FISHER: I think that's right. 

This is the easier case in that sense too. It's

 not just a most case.  It's a most and the only 

situations I can think of are something else, 

so, therefore, you get to all by the totality of

 Agent Flood's testimony.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  Whereas down 

the other road, we're going to have a bunch of 

Daubert questions. We're also going to have how 

much probability is enough probability questions 

too. 

MR. FISHER: You -- you -- you could. 

I think -- I think the better rule there is that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the text of the 

rule, that seems to be a problem for you just in 

my view. And then you rely heavily on the

 government's saying: Well, even though the text 

only says that it prohibits expert testimony 

that this defendant had knowledge, that may also 

prohibit testimony that all defendants in the 

class always have knowledge. 

And you seize on that, understandably. 

MR. FISHER: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But then the key 

move in your argument, I think, is that "always" 

means the same thing as "usually," and that's 

just not true. 

MR. FISHER: Oh, I agree, that's not 

true. So there's -- there's two steps, Justice 

Kavanaugh.  So the first is whether the 

defendant, to use the text of the rule, covers a 

class of people including the defendant. 

And I think the answer is yes.  And I

can just give you a couple more examples. If

 somebody -- if somebody was trying to figure out 

what a member of this Court thought and somebody

 answered, well, Supreme Court Justices always 

think X, that would be a statement about whether

 that particular Justice had a particular state

 of mind.

 And then the second step is whether

 the "always" versus "probably" matters.  It 

matters in some sense.  It's a degree of 

certitude.  But, to go back to the text of the 

rule, it is still an opinion about whether that 

Justice has something in her mind. 

So to say if you're trying to figure 

out what some justice thinks and somebody says, 

Justices usually think X, that is a statement 

about whether the justice has a particular state 

of mind. 

Now it's not absolute, but it goes to 

the nature of expert testimony. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's not -- how is 

testifying that usually, how is that an opinion 

about whether the defendant did have a mental 

state? 

MR. FISHER: It -- it -- in its

 opinion about whether the defendant did or did 

not have the mental state. So did or did not

 covers the full scope.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.

 MR. FISHER: And I think an opinion

 can be absolute or it can be probabilistic.

 Take the opinion -- take the example 

we give in our brief where a therapist, after

 invest -- after interviewing a patient, says: 

People don't usually have trouble getting out of 

bed unless they're depressed. 

Well, that's not a direct statement 

about that individual, but in context, we 

understand it to be saying, I think you're 

depressed.  You know, we've talked a lot this 

morning, Justice Kavanaugh, about the nature of 

expert testimony.  Expert testimony is rarely 

absolute.  I think a couple of you have pointed 

that out today.  It's usually a probabilistic 

opinion. 

So, to go back to the Hinckley case, 

if the expert had said, I think John Hinckley 

was probably insane, he probably couldn't tell 

right from wrong, that wouldn't be an absolute 

opinion, but it would have to be covered by Rule

the example where, you know, high school seniors 

generally know the honor code.

similar to the hypotheticals Justice Kagan was

 cetera.

 But to -- but you asked me about how

 you would articulate the rule.  If you wanted to

 be extra careful, you don't even have to

 articulate that part of the rule.  Here, you 

have a statement directly about knowledge.

 So whatever the line is between

 knowledge and other statements that might be 

less direct about the particular mens rea, that 

would be a different case. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I think we'd 

be down the sowing chaos road if we didn't 

articulate whoever ruled in that. 

MR. FISHER: Well -- well, either way, 

you're going to have to answer that question. 

Pages 28 to 30 of the government's brief, it 

says that testimony needs to be understood in 

context and what it -- and what it signals in so 

many words. 

I think the government agrees that 

statements are going to have to be understood in 

context as to whether or not they're about mens 

rea. So we agree with that. 

We might -- we might calibrate that

give a first cut at it in this opinion, but, 

again, all you have to say in this opinion --

and this goes back to Justice Kavanaugh's

 question -- is that the words "the defendant"

 cover not just statements about the defendant, 

but they cover statements about a class of 

people that includes the defendant, regardless 

of whether they're absolute or probabilistic. 

Then you're done.  You can say that, 

you know, therefore, we can give some guiding 

principles to when something is about mens rea 

or not about mens rea, but you wouldn't even 

have to do that strictly speaking in this case.

expert testimony about mental state is not.

 MR. FISHER: So the -- so mental state

believe this defendant has battered women

 syndrome.  I believe this defendant, to use the

 Hinckley example, has schizophrenia.  So that's 

one form of mental state.

Hinckley example, you could have dueling 

testimony as to whether or not John Hinckley, 

Junior, had schizophrenia or not.  That's not 

the element of the offense.  You could have 

dueling testimony as to whether or not John 

Hinckley, Junior, had hallucinations or 

delusions or had difficulty perceiving reality. 

That's not the element of the crime. 

The element of the crime is being able

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But it says element

 of the crime or defense.

 MR. FISHER: Right, but -- but the

 defense is still negating the mens rea. So the 

critical thing is to pinpoint the mens rea.

 So, in the assault case, the mens rea, 

I think, would be something like a reasonable 

belief that you were acting in self-defense.  I 

think that's what a typical battered women 

syndrome case would look like.  An expert can 

take the stand and say, I believe this person 

has battered women syndrome.  Here are 

characteristics of battered women syndrome: 

There's a cycle of abuse, there's learned 

helplessness, there's difficulty leaving.  All 

these things that are not the element of whether 

or not --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So you 

disagree --

MR. FISHER: -- she believed her life 

was in danger when she acted.

material in these quantities in their apartments

they intend to sell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW GUARNIERI

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

By its plain terms, Rule 704(b) comes 

into play only when the expert is offering an 

opinion about the defendant's own mental state. 

That's the key textual limitation that resolves 

this case.

he did not express any opinion at all about 

whether Petitioner herself knew about the drugs

 hidden in her car.  Indeed, he did not mention 

Petitioner a single time in his entire

 testimony.

 The Court should reject Petitioner's

 invitation to replace the line drawn in the text 

of Rule 704(b) with one of her own invention.

 According to Petitioner, Rule 704(b) prohibits a 

novel and amorphous category of what she has 

called class-wide mens rea testimony. 

That proposal cannot be squared with 

the text, purpose, or history of the rule.  And 

I think the history is particularly instructive 

here. I want to emphasize three points this 

morning. 

First, when Congress enacted Rule 

704(b) in response to the acquittal of John 

Hinckley, Congress adopted a reform that applies 

equally to both sides.  It is party agnostic, as 

Justice Gorsuch observed this morning.  It is 

not a rule targeted at government experts.  And 

whatever the Court says in this case will also 

govern future expert testimony offered by the 

defense on issues like insanity or battered

 Second, Congress kept Rule 704(a) in 

place. The general rule in federal court

 continues to be that opinion testimony is not 

objectionable merely because it embraces an 

ultimate issue. Rule 704(b) operates as a 

limited exception to that general rule.

 And, third, the original text of Rule 

704(b) confirms that an expert may still testify 

with respect to the mental state or condition of 

the defendant, as long as the expert stops short 

of opining on the ultimate issue.  Agent Flood 

respected that limitation here. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But Mr. Fisher makes 

the point that in effect, when you talk about 

the probable -- probabilities of someone 

carrying drugs, that you are in effect talking 

about the defendant, that you could only be 

concerned about the conduct of the defendant. 

So the -- how would you respond to 

that?

friend on the other side is conflating two 

distinct issues in this case.  One is whether

the expert is offering an opinion that is about

 the defendant herself.  Agent Flood did not do

 that here when he testified in general terms

 that drug traffickers do not entrust large 

quantities of drugs to people who are unaware of

 those -- in most circumstances.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, his point is 

that it wouldn't be relevant otherwise if you

 weren't talking about the defendant. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I think that's 

right, Justice Thomas.  It's true that it is 

relevant because we are asking the jury to infer 

something about the defendant herself, about 

Petitioner herself, from the expert's opinion. 

But that doesn't make it an opinion --

it doesn't mean the expert is expressing an 

opinion about the defendant.  When Rule 704(b) 

talks about expressing an opinion about the 

defendant, it means expressing an opinion framed 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So -- so --

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- in terms of the 

defendant's own mental state.

actually opine because he's not an examining

 expert, isn't that right?  I mean, there really 

isn't a world in which this expert could speak 

directly in a sense to what is going on in this

competent to testify about is sort of, in his 

expertise, how these things work as a general

correct, Justice Jackson, and, indeed, in this

MR. GUARNIERI:  Thank you, Justice 

Kagan. 

Look, I think the distinction between 

those two, the key point that we're trying to 

get across is that Rule 704(b) forbids a 

particular form of opinion testimony.  The 

expert cannot opine on the defendant's own 

mental state. 

And so I -- we acknowledge in our 

brief that there are going to be circumstances 

in which experts testify about a class of people 

and put the defendant in that class.  That form 

of expert testimony could be objectionable. 

But if the issue is just that the 

defendant is describing a general category of 

person --

group of people, I don't think that's a 704(b)

 problem.  It could be --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How -- how about this?

 In -- in -- in my experience, I've seen a lot of 

cases, and I'll tell you that a hypothetical 

person with this many kilograms of drugs in its 

car caught in this kind of way in a car with 

this make and model, who says the following 

things to the police when she's caught, in my 

experience, a person like that is always going 

to have known about the drugs in her car. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Yeah, I think that 

would be objectionable.  Of course, that's not 

the testimony we had in this case, but the D.C. 

Circuit has a case which we cite in our brief 

addressing that kind of use of mirroring 

hypotheticals.  I think that's just a 

transparent way to circumvent Rule 704(b). 

That's not this case.

you're giving of the person who knows is --

mirrors who Ms. Diaz is, so you're not willing 

to be as formalistic as to say she has to be

 named.

 You're willing to say the same rule

 should apply if there's a description that

 basically matches her. Well, then I don't get

 why you're not willing to say if the description 

is a class in which everybody agrees she's a 

part and it's a hundred percent of the class? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, Justice Kagan, 

the way we would articulate the rule is the same 

way that the Ninth Circuit has articulated and 

the Second and D.C. Circuits and other courts of 

appeals have articulated, and that is that what 

the expert may not do is testify in such a way 

that necessarily compels the inference that the 

defendant had --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's just --

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- the requisite mens 

rea.

bit broader or then gets a little bit broader, 

but in all these cases, the person is a member

 of the class, however exactly you define the 

class. So I guess I don't see why at some point 

you're willing to draw the line.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I'm not sure

 that's true, Justice Kagan.  There are going to 

be cases in which there's a dispute, a factual 

dispute, about whether or not the defendant is 

in the class. 

Does the defendant have this mental 

condition or defect or this other one or perhaps 

no mental disease or defect at all?  So you can 

-- the issue -- the parties can join issue on 

whether the defendant is even in the class that 

the expert is describing. 

I -- I -- to step back here, I also 

want to, again, stress that Rule 704(b) is a 

limited exception to the general rule here, 

which is 704(a), and that is that, in general, 

opinion testimony is not objectionable just 

because it -- it embraces an ultimate issue. 

You can have -- when Congress enacted 

Rule 704(a), it made a judgment that we're going 

to general -- in general abolish the ultimate

disputes should be channeled through disputes

 about the reliability of the expert's testimony, 

whether the expert's testimony is based on 

sufficient facts and data under Rule 702.

 You can have robust Daubert 

gatekeeping under this Court's case law, which 

is now reflected in the text of Rule 702, and 

Rule 704(b) is just a limited prohibition on a 

specific form of expert opinion testimony in 

criminal trials. 

Agent Flood's testimony looks nothing

 explicitly in terms of knowledge.

 So, for example, the -- the -- the tax 

lawyer example that we offer in our 

hypothetical, I take my friend on the other side 

to agree that testimony that tax lawyers are

 generally instructed in the requirement to pay 

some particular tax is not opinion testimony

 about -- that would be forbidden by 704(b) 

because it doesn't speak to knowledge. 

And I think that's actually the 

correct understanding of "about."  It's not 

about -- it's not about mental state if it's not 

framed directly or expressly in terms of mental 

state. But the problem is my -- my friend on 

the other side doesn't logically carry that 

through to the rest of the text of Rule 704(b). 

The opinion has to be not just about 

mental state but also about the defendant's own 

mental state.  And to be about the defendant's 

own mental state, the expert has to be in 

general explicitly taking the stand and 

expressing an opinion for the jury about what 

was in the defendant's mind.

 do -- we can argue about how wide you define the 

class, but you could just say anyone who has 55

 To me, that's a functional equivalent 

of saying this defendant had 55 pounds of drugs,

 so she has to know.  And you admitted to -- to

an opinion that leaves for the jury no room 

to -- to make the ultimate inference for itself. 

And in -- and if you express an explicit opinion 

about the defendant's state of mind, that could 

be sufficient for a violation.

All we're saying is we want to leave 

open the possibility that that might not be

 necessary to -- for a violation because you're

 going to have these extreme cases in which an

 expert contrives to offer some opinion that 

carefully avoids stating an express opinion

 about the defendant in that particular case but

 nonetheless logically, necessarily compels the

 inference that the defendant had the requisite 

mental state. 

So we're talking here about the 

marginal case. And, again, to return to some of 

the colloquy earlier --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just ask 

before you -- before you go on, I'm wondering 

whether some of the problem here might be our 

not really focusing in on the fact that there 

are different kinds of experts and different 

kinds of testimony. 

And so, to the extent that this rule 

says that it relates to an opinion about whether 

the defendant did or did not have a mental state 

or condition and it was generated in the context 

of a dispute about testimony related to the 

psychiatric or, you know, physical condition of

a particular defendant, Hinckley, I'm just

 wondering whether the problem might be that this

 is really directed at not this kind of 

testimony, the kind of testimony that comes from

 an expert who hasn't examined this defendant,

 doesn't know anything about this defendant and 

is talking about framework or, you know, general

 modus operandi, whereas this rule seems to be

 targeting the kind of expert who has examined or 

knows something about this defendant's mental 

state. 

What do you think about that? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, Justice Jackson, 

I -- I think that's correct as a historical 

description of what Congress had in mind here 

when it enacted Rule 704(b), but I think the 

logic of that intuition supports our position in 

this case, not Petitioner's, and that is 

because, when Congress enacted Rule 704(b) 

against the backdrop of robust public debate 

about what appropriate testimony, what 

appropriate expert testimony should be offered 

in criminal trials involving the insanity 

defense, it was clear to everyone at the time 

that Congress was not eliminating all expert

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, of course not.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  The -- the text of the

 rule --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I mean, isn't --

isn't the line -- I thought the text had to do 

with whether it's an element of -- of the

 offense or -- or the defense.

 So, for example, in Hinckley, an 

expert could still get up and say and opine on 

Mr. Hinckley's mental state, to the extent he 

has schizophrenia, he can say that.  And a 

battered woman, she has what we would define as 

battered women syndrome. 

What they can't do is say:  And, 

therefore, Mr. Hinckley or the -- or the other 

-- any other defendant, did or did not have the 

mental state required to either convict or to 

make out an insanity defense. 

That's the line, isn't it? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Yes, Justice Gorsuch. 

And I think that is just an articulation of our 

position in this case. And -- and -- and to 

return to our earlier exchange -- and I think

MR. GUARNIERI:  I -- I think those all

 could be impermissible if -- if I've understood

 the three examples.  But, Justice Gorsuch, 

again, earlier I think one of the -- one of --

one of our exchanges was about, well, isn't it

 only -- the fact that it is coming into court at

 all shows that it's being offered to prove the

 defendant's mental state.  And I think the 

Hinckley example shows that can't be the correct 

understanding of Rule 704(b). 

Everyone understands when you're 

calling your examining expert in a trial 

involving the insanity defense to offer that 

expert's diagnosis of the particular defendant's 

mental state, the reason it is relevant is 

because you want the jury to draw some inference 

about whether the defendant does or does not 

meet the insanity defense --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, if we think about 

the insanity --

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- the -- the legal 

standard for insanity, and that doesn't mean 

it's prohibited on 704(b) grounds.

insanity argument, I mean, an expert can come up

 necessary intent or not.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Yeah, I think the 

problem with the particular testimony that 

Congress was targeting in Rule 704(b) is that

 the expert is drawing an explicit link between 

the defendant and the legal requirement that the 

jury has to find. That's what Congress said, no

 more of that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that -- that --

MR. GUARNIERI:  It created a public --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that is what the

disease and I'm going to tell you what people 

with this disease -- you know, whether they're 

capable of distinguishing right from wrong or 

whether they're capable of having some other 

necessary intent for the crime. 

So he's saying as a fact of the matter 

in his professional opinion but a 

hundred percent of the people with this disease 

are going to have this intent.

that's a variation on the syllogism that we

 identify in our brief at page -- pages 28 to 29. 

If the expert says everyone in this category --

if you are in category X, it follows that you 

have mental condition Y, and also I as an expert 

have diagnosed the defendant as being in

 category X, you have just broken down one 

impermissible opinion into two steps, and we do 

think 704(b) would keep that out. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Guarnieri --

MR. GUARNIERI:  But -- but, again, I 

mean, it's not the categorical nature of the 

testimony that is the problem here.  If you have 

a case in which you have called an expert to 

describe, for example, color blindness and the 

-- and that's relevant to an ultimate issue in

 704(b).

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- a lot more 

complicated than I think it has to be. 704(b) 

says about whether the defendant did or did not 

have a mental state or condition, dah-dah-dah. 

It doesn't say "is relevant to."

 Congress -- the -- the Rules Committee 

presumably knew what the standard was for

 relevance, and if they wanted to make -- to say 

that the expert cannot state an opinion, cannot 

state anything that is relevant to the issue, 

they would have said so -- they would have said 

so explicitly. 

And a lot of these hypotheticals, it 

seems to me, are taken care of by other rules. 

I don't know how any expert could say a hundred 

percent of the time this is true.  I -- I don't 

think that's reliable.  It's subject to 

objection under 702.  And some of these matters 

could be handled under 403. 

I don't know why you're -- and -- and 

then some -- some of them could just be fuel for 

devastating cross-examination.  If -- you know, 

if an expert says a hundred percent of the time 

this is true, I -- I -- I think that that would

 the party who introduces -- introduces that

 testimony.

 But let me ask you this.  There are 

people who think that there's a lot of chaos in 

the states that comprise the Ninth Circuit, but, 

I don't know, until this morning, it hadn't 

occurred to me that maybe the cause for this 

chaos is the Ninth Circuit's rule about 704. 

Do you think that's true? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  No. We have not seen 

any practical problems in applying -- in 

applying the longstanding understanding of Rule 

704(b) that we are advocating in this case. 

And, Justice Alito, to -- to your 

earlier points, I entirely agree with you that 

many other rules will take care of some of the 

hypotheticals that we are battering about today. 

I took the Court to just be interested in how do 

you define the outer limits of how Rule 704(b) 

should apply. 

Of course, this case doesn't 

necessarily present any occasion to address 

those outer limits because Agent Flood's 

testimony here looked nothing like some of the

 hypotheticals that we've been discussing this

 morning. 

The other point I would make, Justice

 Alito -- and -- and we advert to this in our

 brief -- Rule 702 itself was recently amended in 

ways that were meant to discourage experts from 

overstating the certainty with which they could

 express their opinions on the stand.  Rule 702 

and Daubert gatekeeping is really the way that 

you handle concerns that an expert is stating 

something in categorical or absolute terms that 

is just not supportable by the facts underlying 

the expert's opinion. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, have you 

had any trouble convicting drug mules in the 

Fifth Circuit? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  No, Justice Gorsuch. 

And -- and I -- I take your point that this 

isn't going to be critical testimony in every 

case or -- or, indeed, in any particular case. 

And we have instances in which --

I mean, one can draw an inference from that 

pretty quickly when she says, I can't -- I can't

 roll down my window. 

I mean, there -- there's -- in my

 experience, I mean -- and in the Tenth Circuit,

 for example, we -- we took as a reliable

 indication sometimes one -- one contributing

 factor for a traffic stop was there -- there --

there are air fresheners in the car, okay, and 

it was traveling below the speed limit, okay, 

and in a panel van, and the -- and the windows 

couldn't roll down.  I mean, the -- all the 

modus operandi evidence in the world.  And you 

can draw inferences from that. 

The one thing the rule says is you 

can't reach inside someone's head.  And it 

doesn't seem to be a problem in the Fifth 

Circuit. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Justice Gorsuch, I 

don't -- I don't dispute that. I think you're 

right. We are -- we are convicting defendants 

of illegally importing drugs in the United 

States in the Fifth Circuit without this 

testimony.

And -- and so too I think we could

 obtain convictions in the Ninth Circuit without

 this testimony.  And -- and we have a harmless 

error argument here, which, you know, I mean, 

the upshot of that argument is, I think, the 

other evidence in this case was overwhelming 

that Petitioner knew about the drugs in her car.

 Nonetheless, this is helpful and 

reliable testimony, and we think the jury should 

be allowed to hear it. And -- and I think, if 

you're thinking about the case through the lens 

of, you know, what -- what is sort of the 

practical -- the practicalities here, if you 

adopt Petitioner's rule on the other hand, it's 

going to open up a host of arbitrary and 

difficult line-drawing exercises that I don't 

think he really had persuasive answers to this 

morning. 

And so I think what the Court should 

do is stick to the text of Rule 704(b) itself, 

and Rule 704(b) only comes into play when the 

defendant expresses an opinion about the 

defendant's own -- excuse me -- when the expert 

expresses an opinion about the defendant's own 

mental state.

do not entrust large quantities of drugs to

 people who are unaware of those drugs.  He

 explained why that was true.  And he elaborated

 on cross-examination that, of course, he -- he 

is aware of some scenarios in which the 

traffickers may try to use so-called blind 

mules, and he described the facts of those 

scenarios, and they don't meet the facts of this

 So, you know, if it -- you don't need

said under 704 that might cross the line --

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to say that 

every defendant with schizophrenia had --

doesn't know right from wrong or knows right 

from wrong because some expert could say 

schizophrenia doesn't cloud your mind, it just 

makes you believe you have a reason to do it. 

So which is it?

 morning, I regret it, but I -- the key thing 

from our point of view about the application of 

Rule 704(b) is whether the testimony is framed

 in terms of the defendant.

 And I think my friend on the other

 side gets some mileage out of positing

 hypotheticals where he's talking about, oh, a

 class that obviously includes the defendant or 

necessarily includes the defendant and things 

like that.  I think it really does matter 

whether the expert takes the stand and opines 

about the defendant in particular.  That's 

really the key dividing line, and that's the 

dividing line --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I think we 

all --

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- that follows 

directly from --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- agree on that. 

He says the defendant knew.  That's a violation 

of the rule. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  That's right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The question is, 

when he says the defendant, all people who have 

X, Y, and Z know, you're willing to say, if all

be this defendant, correct?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I think the --

the key question from our perspective in

 confronting a hypothetical like that would be

 has the -- the defendant -- excuse me -- has the 

testifying expert himself taken the stand and 

put the defendant in that class.

 If all that is at issue is that the 

jury could --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, he's only 

there because --

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- infer from other 

evidence, I mean, in order to put Petitioner in 

the class of drug couriers here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sorry.  So how 

about if he says 99.9 percent --

MR. GUARNIERI:  Yeah.  I can't --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- know? 

Ninety-five percent know? Ninety percent know? 

Where do we draw the line? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Yeah, I don't think 

that's the line that Rule 704(b) draws.  It's 

not a rule about categorical versus conditional 

testimony.  It's a -- it's a line about expert

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  About the --

MR. GUARNIERI:  The distinction --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- about a

 defendant's mental state? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Yes.  Yes.  And I

 think, if you have concerns in a particular case 

that a defendant's opinion -- excuse me, that an 

expert opinion is, you know, overstating the 

certainty with which that expert could describe 

some fact of the world, that's a problem under 

Rule 702 and Daubert. It's not a problem under 

Rule 704(b). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher might have 

some line-drawing problems, but I think you do 

too, Mr. Guarnieri. 

And I mean, if I -- if -- if -- if I 

understand what you're now saying, you're now 

saying on the one hand, if an expert got up and 

said a hundred percent of drug mules know what 

they're doing, that could not be excluded under 

your rule, but -- but if the expert got up and 

said, I think that this defendant, what -- it --

for this particular drug cartel, and now I'm

 going to tell you that a hundred percent of 

mules who work for this particular drug cartel

 know -- know that they're carrying drugs, then

 you say it is excluded.  Is that correct?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Yeah, I think that is 

the expert expressing an opinion for the jury

 about the defendant having the requisite mental

 state. That's out under 704(b). 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  And so then, if 

we go back to the one that is not excluded, it's 

the expert getting up and just saying, all drug 

mules have knowledge of what they're doing.  I 

guess I'm just not seeing the difference between 

that statement and the other one because 

everybody knows that this woman was caught in a 

car with drugs, so she's a drug mule.  And the 

expert is saying all drug mules have knowledge. 

So, once you're going to tell me that the other 

is excluded, that should be excluded too. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, Justice Kagan, 

let me try and answer that question on two 

levels, one just a mechanical level. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I just want it 

like on my level.

I think this --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Like the level of the

 question.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Justice Kagan, the --

the reason -- the distinction between those two 

is the distinction drawn in the text of Rule

 704(b) itself, which is is the expert expressing 

an opinion about the defendant. And in one, the 

expert is expressing an opinion, taking the 

stand and testifying to the jury I as an expert 

have concluded and as a matter of my expert 

opinion that the defendant had the mental state, 

the requisite mental state.  Rule 704(b) forbids 

that. 

Now the -- the -- the second-level 

response that I also wanted to offer to -- to 

your question, Justice Kagan, is I -- we have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't really 

under -- okay. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- there's -- there's 

a -- there's a rationality, there's a reason 

that Congress drew that -- the line that it drew 

in Rule 704(b) and it has to do with the

 has the requisite mental state?  What -- what

 rational Congress would -- would do such a

 thing?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  I -- I think Rule 

704(b), if you look at the history of the 

provision, reflects a judgment by Congress that 

having dueling experts in insanity cases 

directly opine for the jury on whether the 

defendant satisfies the legal definition of 

insanity was unseemly, that it created a public 

spectacle --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Exactly. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- that undermined the 

integrity of the proceedings --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But you're allowing 

in --

MR. GUARNIERI:  -- and that it led to 

overstatement by the expert. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- all of that 

testimony -- you're still allowing in all of

that testimony.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I think again --

and this --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All he has to say 

is, instead of Hinckley or instead of the

 mirroring hypothetical, all persons in this

 category.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  This goes back to an

 exchange that I had with Justice Jackson 

earlier.  I think it was the understanding of 

everyone involved at the time and the text of 

the original rule reflects that you are still 

going to have experts who can come in in a 

criminal trial and testify with respect to the 

mental state or condition of the defendant. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Certainly. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  That's not prohibited 

by Rule 704(b). 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  With respect to 

whether he has -- whether he has schizophrenia, 

sure, whether he has mental illness, yes, but 

not -- I mean, the text of the rule says not 

with respect to the element of the crime or the 

defense. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  That's right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I guess that

 drawing a line between testimony about a class 

or a group on the one hand and testimony about 

an individual happens at trial all the time. 

Judges are familiar with drawing that line.  And 

I'm interested in the law professors', evidence 

professors' brief because they point to one 

context in which that happens with fair 

frequency, which is with respect to eyewitness 

testimony. 

And they say courts often allow expert 

testimony regarding factors that on average 

interfere with accurate eyewitness 

identifications.  However, courts do not allow 

experts to draw an individual inference and 

testify that a particular witness is likely 

inaccurate. 

They go on to say, because social

science research isn't reliably -- even though 

it is itself replicated and reliable, it can't 

support a reliable statement about an individual

 case, especially when that social scientist

 hasn't really examined that individual case.

 And so judge -- judges, they at least say, are

 pretty familiar with the kind of line.

 So is this the line you're drawing?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Yeah, well, Justice 

Jackson, I -- I think that brief -- the point 

the professors are making in that brief is that 

concerns that the expert has testified in some 

way that overstates the expert's ability to draw 

an inference about the particular case are not 

unfamiliar in federal court.  Courts handle 

those kinds of concerns every day under Rule 

702. And you could have a similar dynamic for 

testimony like this. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  And that --

I guess what I'm suggesting is that there is a 

difference between a -- an expert talking about 

a group, an "on average," and here are the 

statistics that relate to how people operate or 

think or whatever as a group and that that's 

actually a different kind of testimony and

individual, right, is a member of that group,

same way. That's still left to the jury so long

say, and this individual is in that group,

 right? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  I think that's exactly 

right. We think that's how Rule 704(b) should

case law on the -- Rule 704(b). So, on the

 mirroring situation the Court has talked about,

 there's a Ninth Circuit case from 2005 called 

Younger, where the Ninth Circuit says that 

evidence is admissible because it does not

 particularly speak to the defendant, with "the

 defendant" in italics in that opinion.  So the 

government there is moving away from the Ninth

 Circuit's view. 

I don't fully understand exactly what 

the government is saying about what we've called 

hundred percent testimony or "always" testimony, 

but, Justice Kavanaugh, I do want to absolutely 

stress those are real-world examples.  They're 

at page 23 of our brief.  That's the exact 

testimony that agents like Agent Flood gave in 

cases like this until 2013, when the government 

discovered there actually were some blind mules 

out there. 

So it's merely a -- it's merely a 

situation of this particular scenario where the 

government's backed off it for empirical 

reasons.  But you could have other cases where 

an expert would testify in the real world that 

people with schizophrenia can never tell right

executives in corporations when they lie to 

government investigators always know they're

 telling a lie. That would be perfectly

 real-world examples.

 And I think, regardless of what the

 government's precise position is, it's very 

difficult to argue that kind of testimony would

 be okay under Rule 704(b). 

Let me give you one last scenario 

about the government's line-drawing problems. 

There's a case called Watson from the Third 

Circuit that's in our brief.  The government 

itself seems to agree with the outcome in 

Watson.  In that case, the prosecutor asked the 

expert: Do you have an opinion as to whether or 

not the defendant here had the requisite intent? 

The expert says:  Yes, I have an opinion. 

People like this generally have the requisite 

intent. 

The government seems to agree that is 

out under Rule 704(b).  Now maybe that's 

because, at pages 28 to 30, it draws a 

contextual rule of some kind.  But there are 

these very difficult line-drawing problems under

the government's rule.

 Our rule is simple.  If you talk about

 "the" defendant herself, it's -- it's covered by 

Rule 704(b), or a class of people including the

 defendant, you're talking -- you're covered by

 Rule 704(b).  Here, the class of people, Agent 

Flood is quite specific, people carrying large

 quantities of drugs across the border.  That's

 the class.  The defendant here is unquestionably 

a member of that class.  And so his testimony is 

about the defendant. 

I want to say one last thing.  Justice 

Kagan and Justice Jackson asked about some of 

the history and intent of Rule 704(b).  Let's 

just use the Hinckley case.  And the Senate 

report is only a page long.  I would urge you to 

read that if you think that's important here. 

And what the Senate said was, we're concerned 

about experts testifying about the subject of 

mens rea. 

And so, after the Hinckley trial, if 

an expert were to testify we think people like 

this who are exhibiting these conditions 

generally couldn't tell right from wrong or 

probably couldn't tell right from wrong or in

most circumstances couldn't tell right from

 wrong, it seems crazy to think Congress would 

have thought that was okay under the Hinckley

 trial.

 The problem in the Hinckley trial was 

that the expert was testifying not just about

 facts from which a jury could infer mens rea, 

but the jury was expressing an opinion on the 

ultimate issue of mens rea from which the jury 

could go into the jury room and do nothing but 

say, oh, we agree with the expert. 

And whether the expert expressed that 

opinion in terms of probably this -- this 

defendant had the mens rea or didn't have the 

mens rea or certainly, the problem is that the 

jury can go back to the jury room and say: 

Look, sounds like Agent Flood, you know, thinks 

people like this generally have the mens rea. 

He must be right.  We'll go along with that. 

The point of the right to jury trial 

and the point of the ultimate issue doctrine is 

that when it comes to the special subject of 

mens rea -- and, Justice Jackson, I want to be 

really specific here -- mens rea as the element 

of the crime to convict or as the defense, that

 particular subject has a wall around it.  The

 jury is -- is -- is required to make an

 independent moralistic, qualitative

 determination.

 And that's what Agent Flood did wrong 

here. He said most people like this know they

 have drugs in their car.  Knowledge is the exact

 element of the crime.

 So whatever -- whatever else Rule 

704(b) may cover in terms of statements that 

cover mens rea, this one explicitly did, and 

that's why it went over the line. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted.
