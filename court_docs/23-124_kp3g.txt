P R O C E E D I N G S

 (10:12 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 23-124, Harrington

 versus Purdue Pharma.

 Mr. Gannon.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court. 

The court of appeals approved a 

Chapter 11 reorganization plan that will release 

claims that Purdue Pharma's creditors have 

against other nondebtors, principally, the 

Sackler family members who took billions of 

dollars from Purdue in the years before Purdue's 

bankruptcy but have not filed for bankruptcy 

protection themselves and have made only a 

portion of their assets available to the estate 

in Purdue's bankruptcy. 

The court of appeals found authority 

for that release in a catchall provision of 

Chapter 11.  Section 1123(b)(6) says a plan may 

include any other appropriate provision not 

inconsistent with the applicable provisions of 

Heritage Reporting Corporation

this title.

 But this release goes beyond what the

 statute authorizes as construed in its context, 

and it also conflicts with the basic nuts and 

bolts of the Bankruptcy Code's comprehensive

 scheme.  It permits the Sacklers to decide how

 much they're going to contribute.  It grants the 

Sacklers the functional equivalent of a 

discharge, what they might get if they 

themselves were in bankruptcy, though even such 

a discharge would not extend, as this one does, 

to claims involving fraud and willful misconduct 

and even though Section 524(e) expressly 

provides that the discharge of a debtor does not 

affect the liability of any other entity. 

This release extinguishes personal 

property rights, the creditors' state law chosen 

said action, that do not belong to the 

bankruptcy estate.  That result is not supported 

by any historical analogue in equity, and it 

raises significant constitutional questions that 

should be avoided in the absence of a clear 

command from Congress. 

This Court should hold that 

nonconsensual third-party releases are not

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Garre, under your 

reading of these provisions of the Bankruptcy

 Code, are consensual agreements or releases

 acceptable?

 MR. GANNON:  We do think consensual

 releases are acceptable.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  What's the 

difference -- on what provision in the code do 

you rely for that? 

MR. GANNON: We don't think there 

needs to be authority in the code for that 

because the authority for the release is coming 

from the parties' agreement.  There's no need to 

use a bankruptcy power to forcibly resolve 

claims that don't actually belong to the estate 

or seek estate property, and -- and there 

wouldn't be a need for an injunction at that 

point. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So you're saying that 

the mere fact that they consent gives the 

bankruptcy court authority? 

MR. GANNON: No -- well, we are saying 

that the bankruptcy court can -- can acknowledge

the parties' agreement, but we're -- whether --

whether that goes in the plan I think is an 

administrative question there. The force of the 

release is coming from the parties' agreement.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Conceptually, though,

 what's the difference between a consensual and a

 nonconsensual release?

 MR. GANNON: Conceptually, the 

difference is that the party is surrendering its 

property right with its consent, and, therefore, 

it doesn't present the same problems that we 

have with a nonconsensual release. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I can see that 

from a due process standpoint, but from the 

standpoint of the bank -- bankruptcy court 

resolving that, I don't see what the difference 

is. 

MR. GANNON: Well, the difference is 

that, as I said at the beginning of this answer, 

you don't need the forcible authority of the 

Bankruptcy Code or the bankruptcy court to 

extinguish the property right there.  It's been 

extinguished by virtue of the agreement of the 

parties.  And so, if the parties have agreed 

that -- that -- that this is the terms of the

agreement, the plan may be contingent upon that

 side agreement, but that doesn't mean that the 

bankruptcy court needs to give its imprimatur to 

that agreement in order for it to be

 enforceable.  It's already separately

 enforceable.

           JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, finally, the --

 under (b)(6) -- (b)(6) seems pretty broad. How

 do you -- how would you narrow that to your --

to reach your conclusion? 

MR. GANNON: Well, we think that you 

should construe it in context, and we think it's 

important that the enumerated provisions at the 

beginning of (b) are all limited to what this 

Court has repeatedly said the Bankruptcy Code is 

about, which is the relationship between 

creditors and debtors. 

If you look at the enumerated 

provisions, (b)(2) talks about assumption, 

rejection, and assignment of executory contracts 

and leases of the debtor.  (b)(3)(A), which is 

particularly important here, talks about the 

settlement of claims or interests belonging to

context, we think that it makes sense that, if 

you can settle claims of the estate, it doesn't 

mean that you can settle claims that are not of

 the estate. 

And we point out that this is 

inconsistent with many other provisions in the

 code. It's inconsistent with the scope of a

 discharge with respect to who can get the

 discharge and what can be discharged.  We cite 

multiple provisions that get to that.  It's 

inconsistent with the idea that the debtor's 

supposed to be contributing all of its assets 

with a, you know, a handful of exemptions to be 

property of the estate, and that's not what the 

Sacklers are doing here. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the 

argument that you just described, which was the 

same one you began with, which is you have a 

series of provisions focused on particular 

issues that arise in the context of the 

bankruptcy and then you have a general catchall 

talking about appropriate provisions not 

inconsistent, it seems to me that that's a

MR. GANNON: Well, I -- we don't think

you look at Czyzewski, the Court just used 

regular principles of statutory construction. 

It did cite the principle that -- that we don't 

think that Congress hides elephants in mouse 

holes. And so, to the extent that your impulse 

is getting at that issue, we tend to agree with 

it. 

We think that this is a catchall 

provision that needs to be construed in context,

 cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But don't you think 

that this is the sort of problem that should be 

addressed by somebody, either by Congress or by 

this Court?  As a practical matter, let's 

consider what's involved here. 

As I understand it, the Sacklers, the 

bankruptcy court, the creditors, Purdue, and 

just about everybody else in this litigation 

thinks that the Sacklers' funds in spendthrift 

trusts overseas are unreachable. Do you agree 

with that?  And, if you do agree with that, is 

this the best deal that's available for the 

creditors? 

MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I -- I don't 

think we have a reason to think that spendthrift 

trusts overseas might be unreachable.  I do 

think that the Sacklers think that they are --

are at -- at risk, and that's why they've

extent that the other side is saying this is the 

best possible deal, we think that that's a

 reason why wide-scale consent is more likely to 

be a viable solution here, and yet it's

 appropriate for us as a watchdog for the 

bankruptcy system to say that the court can't 

exceed its statutory authority here and it can't 

simply redistribute others' private property 

rights because we think that that's the best 

deal available and it would serve the greatest 

good for the greatest number.

 both sides of the deal.

 If -- if the fraudulent conveyance 

claims could reach those assets, they could be 

brought in forcibly through the bankruptcy

 procedure.  To the extent that the Sacklers want 

to have some of the benefits of bankruptcy

 without fully participating, we think that they 

need to get consent. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, what does 

consent look like?  I've been trying to imagine 

that in a case like this.  You -- you have the 

states and so they could consent.  They're an 

identified party.  But there's, I don't know, 

thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, maybe 

millions of personal injury claims. 

Is an opt-out consent? How do you get 

it? 

MR. GANNON: Well, our -- our -- our 

position, the U.S. Trustee's position, has been 

that opt-in consents are necessary for the type 

of independent force waiver of property rights 

that I was discussing with Justice Thomas. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But not opt-out --

not opt-out provisions.

MR. GANNON: Not opt-out.  I think 

that those may be different with respect to the

 constitutional concerns.  But, with respect to

 the question of -- of establishing that somebody 

has actually waived their property rights here,

 we've said opt-in is required. We think that

 there should be affirmative consent.  Of course,

 here, there isn't any form of consent at all,

 and -- and so, if -- if you were to say that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, basically, 

you're telling Justice Alito that there really 

is no way to do this in bankruptcy right now,

that there is no way to do this --

work.

Sotomayor. We cite the PG&E case, which is a 

mass tort in California arising from wildfires. 

That came in the Ninth Circuit, which doesn't 

permit nonconsensual releases.  And that has an

to the money, the claims that exist against 

Purdue, and -- and we -- we understand that. 

That's what bankruptcy is for. 

If Purdue is insolvent and its money 

isn't going to go far enough to pay off all the 

claims, that's -- that's why the bankruptcy 

court and the -- and its powers can be used to 

restructure the relationship between Purdue and 

its creditors. 

But that doesn't mean that somebody 

else gets to say, well, we're going to create a 

supplemental limited fund and take advantage of 

the same procedures.  And -- and so, we think 

this is particularly inconsistent with Section

 indemnified, meaning that the claims against 

them are in effect claims against the company,

 where the -- where the directors and officers 

have made contributions for distribution to the

 creditors, and where -- you know, your -- your

 opening never mentioned the opioid victims.  The 

opioid victims and their families overwhelmingly 

approve this plan because they think it will 

ensure prompt pay -- payment. 

So, in those circumstances, those 

narrow circumstances, bankruptcy courts for 30 

years have been approving plans like this, and I 

guess I'm trying to figure out, with all that 

practice under the judiciary's belt, why we 

would say it's categorically inappropriate when 

the statutory term "appropriate" is one that 

takes account usually of all the facts and 

circumstances. 

MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I take the 

point that "appropriate" can -- can do a lot of 

work there.  We think that it's not appropriate 

to simply take property rights that -- that 

aren't accessible to the estate in bankruptcy.

 release sweeps much more broadly than that.  It

 isn't just people who are directors and 

officers. They may be the main ones who need 

the release, who would have the most liability. 

But the indemnification claims don't cover

 everything in here.

 And there's an exception in the

 indemnification agreement for good faith.  So 

it's not even clear that this indemnification 

agreement --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But I guess --

enforceable in the context of this case. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- that's a

I think what the opioid victims and their

coming in and telling the families, no, we're 

not going to give you payment, prompt payment, 

for what's happened to your family, and we're

talking with Justice Alito, are you contesting 

the finding that this provision was necessary

 for the reorganization?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I -- I think 

that that was falsified by the fact that it got 

renegotiated as soon as the district court

 ruled. And our point is that the -- we're not

 casting aside the 3 percent.  We're saying that, 

if there are a handful of small outlying claims, 

the Sacklers can deal with those on the side. 

They can get consent that takes care of 

everything else. 

If there happen to be some large 

outstanding claims for people who don't want to 

consent, then we think it's a much bigger deal 

then that that property right is being taken and 

extinguished without those parties' consent. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, your position 

rests on a lot of sort of hifalutin principles 

of bankruptcy law.  But another hifalutin 

principle of bankruptcy law is you're supposed 

to maximize the estate, and you're supposed to 

do things that will effectuate successful 

reorganizations.

against the huge, huge, huge majority of

 claimants who have decided that, if this

 provision goes under, they're going to end up

 with nothing.

 MR. GANNON: Well, we hope and expect

 that there would still be a deal if this Court

 says that consensual releases are okay, so we

 don't think that they are likely to get nothing. 

We do think that even if this had to go through 

bankruptcy, that there -- the fraudulent 

conveyance claims have value. 

There's a reason why the Sacklers have 

already been willing to offer $6 billion, and we 

see this in other cases.  In the Arrow case with 

3M, when they were in bankruptcy and they wanted 

a nonconsensual release, they were willing to 

offer a billion dollars.  When bankruptcy 

fizzled, within two months, they negotiated a 

settlement where they were paying up to $4.8 

billion or more.

MR. GANNON: That's it.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I -- I was just

 going to ask you what the United States' 

position is going to be. Let's say that you win 

and it goes back down. The Sacklers withdraw

 their offer to contribute all these billions of 

dollars. You have a superpriority claim that

 would deplete most of what's on the table based 

on Purdue's assets right now. 

Would you assert that claim, or would 

you withdraw that and allow the opioid victims 

to recover some -- what's left in Purdue's 

estate? 

MR. GANNON: Right now, that claim is 

part of the criminal guilty plea.  It's a 

forfeiture, it's a criminal forfeiture judgment 

for $2 billion, which we've agreed to stand back 

and allow the states and other governments to 

take 1.775 billion of it if -- if it goes 

forward.  But this is contingent on the guilty 

plea, which is contingent on the -- on the 

confirmation of the plan. 

And so Purdue, if the plan doesn't get 

confirmed, doesn't need to go through with the 

guilty plea. And we might not have the $2

-- that this would be part of a negotiation on

 remand to the extent that consent is possible.

 Until there's plan confirmation, we don't have a 

-- a finalization of the sentence and we don't 

have the $2 billion judgment.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What if there's 

just liquidation of the company, which is what 

the other side raises the specter of? So 

there's liquidation of a billion.  There's no 

contribution.  And then everyone's left with a 

lottery ticket to try to get something --

MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I --

years from now. 

MR. GANNON: -- as I said before, I do 

think that there is value to the fraudulent 

conveyance claim that the estate has against the 

Sacklers.  It may not get to the spendthrift 

trust overseas that Justice Alito was asking 

about at the beginning. 

But I also think that, you know, the 

Sacklers are saying that they want global peace,

 And -- and so I -- I do think that 

there's a very good chance that there is a deal

are you saying that you shouldn't allow this

MR. GANNON: That is not what we're 

saying.  We're saying you shouldn't allow this 

because it takes property that is not part of 

the estate and disposes it as part of the 

bankruptcy.  And I'm saying to the argument that 

this is necessary and bankruptcy courts should 

just do the best they can, that we're not even 

persuaded that this is necessarily going to be 

the best deal because it --

that in terms of the claimants who do not want 

to be bound by the order of the bankruptcy

bankruptcy court.

MR. GANNON: And if that's an outlying 

claim that couldn't be included in a consensual 

agreement, then it can presumably be handled on

 the side.  And if -- if it turns out that there 

are too many outlying claims and the Sacklers 

end up being insolvent because of this, then,

 you know, bankruptcy for them might be the

 answer to that.

 But, right now, a consensual -- a 

nonconsensual deal or a single bankruptcy 

proceeding just might not be the answer to this 

situation. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And I had understood 

that the reason why you're saying that is 

because you're not necessarily hanging your 

argument on the "appropriate" language of the 

statute, but, instead, you're saying that it's 

inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code to allow 

for this process.  Am I right about that? 

I mean, Justice Kavanaugh brought up 

appropriateness, and I'm just trying to 

understand if that's the hook that the 

government is resting on or the government is 

making the argument about inconsistency.

arguments. We do think that this is 

inconsistent with several provisions of the 

code, the ones that talk about the scope of a

 discharge, who's eligible for it, whether it

 could include things like claims for fraud and 

willful misconduct, whether you have to provide 

all of your assets, because we do think that

 this release with the injunction is the

 equivalent -- the functional equivalent of a 

discharge for the Sacklers, that that makes it 

inconsistent with the way the Bankruptcy Code 

operates. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: Would those specific 

MR. GANNON: I would also say that 

that may make it inappropriate, and it's not 

appropriate in light of the colloquy I had with 

the Chief Justice about (b)(1) through (b)(6). 

We just don't think that this is the sort of 

thing that would be living in that catchall 

provision at the end of that bit. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  I guess I'm 

just a little worried about hanging it on 

"appropriate" because I'm trying to understand 

the standard by which you are evaluating that.

I mean, if we're just talking about

 "appropriate" in the sort of general sense of 

people agree with it and many people would like 

it to happen, then I guess you don't get

 "appropriate."

 But, if we're talking -- if we're 

looking at "appropriate" and "inconsistent"

 relative to the overall purposes of the 

Bankruptcy Code, the various provisions that 

you've pointed out, then I suspect you do. 

MR. GANNON: Yeah.  And -- and I -- I 

-- I think that we could win under either of 

those rationales, and I think that in cases like 

Energy Resources, the Court reached its 

conclusion under the -- under -- when this 

provision was located under (b)(5) by just 

saying that -- that that -- that instance was 

something where the provision was consistent 

with the traditional understanding and it was 

part of the bankruptcy court's authority to 

modify creditor/debtor relationships. 

And we don't have that here, and --

and so that's why we think that it doesn't fit 

within either half of -- of the catchall 

provision.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can you speak to the

 Respondents' suggestion that the only way that

 something is inconsistent with the Bankruptcy 

Code is if it directly contradicts a provision

 of the code?  Is that the government's

 understanding of "inconsistent"?

 MR. GANNON: No, and I don't think

 that that was the way the Court had construed 

other cases, like Czyzewski and RadLAX, where 

the -- where the Court looked at provisions, 

looked at things that bankruptcy courts were 

trying to do, and said now this is something 

that isn't expressly prohibited by any provision 

of the code, but that doesn't mean that it isn't 

sufficiently inconsistent with other parts of 

the code that it -- that it's permissible. 

And so, in RadLAX, the inability to 

prevent a secured creditor from using credit 

bidding when there was an auction for assets was 

-- was permitted under -- you couldn't prevent a 

creditor from using credit bidding in an auction 

under one provision.  And the Court said that 

that means that you can't use another provision

 Justice Thomas?

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Gannon, once

 again, the -- just taking the position that 

whether or not the analysis is consistent or 

inconsistent with the code, would you again tell 

me why a consensual agreement, a release, is 

consistent with the code? 

MR. GANNON: We think that it's 

consistent because it is not extinguishing a 

property right without the property owner's 

consent.  We think that all over the law, that 

consent is a basis for parties to agree to waive 

their rights.  We cite the Lawyer against 

Department of Justice case for that. 

And because the court then does not 

need to use the powers of the Bankruptcy Code to 

extinguish the property right, that -- that 

doesn't need to be part of the plan.  The plan 

doesn't need to say, I am hereby releasing this

 the force of the parties' contractual agreement.

 There doesn't need to be an injunction that

 says, you can't enforce that claim that you 

already waived in a contract because that 

contract is going to be separately enforceable.

 And so the -- the -- so the consensual 

release doesn't need the force of the Bankruptcy

 Code and the bankruptcy court in order to take 

effect. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And what exactly is 

the interest of the Trustee in doing that, in 

undoing this?

sense, I am because it seems as though -- and --

and there's been some discussion about that 

virtually -- that the vast majority or 

overwhelming majority of those who have claims 

are interested in having this resolved. 

But the Trustee has a separate role,

MR. GANNON: Well, we -- the Trustee 

has been given this watchdog role and has been 

told by Congress to participate in these 

proceedings.  The Trustee cannot initiate a 

Chapter 11 proceeding but is expressly 

authorized to raise issues in a Chapter 11 

proceeding.  And the Trustee does this in 

hundreds of cases a year. We cite a statistic

that the constitutional concerns, we haven't 

raised it in this Court as a separate 

constitutional question because we think that 

constitutional avoidance is sufficient to get us 

there. I -- but I think that the fact that 

there's not even an opt-out release means that

 And there is enforceable

 extinguishment of property rights.  And the

 other side says there's a hearing with respect 

to that, but it's a hearing that didn't even 

consider the merits of the claim. It

 specifically said that you get nothing.  That 

doesn't even matter because I think that it's 

just better enough that you're getting, you 

know, more for the other claim. 

And, as I said before, we don't think 

that that's the right analysis if you had joint

certainly can't be the analysis when you have

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how do you get

 around -- I -- I -- I don't -- I know you're not 

arguing that case, but you are arguing that

 third-party releases -- it appears you want a

 broad ruling that all third-party releases, 

unless they're consensual, are not permitted. 

So how do we write this not to affect 

that case or any others that have to do --

MR. GANNON: Well, yeah.  We -- we 

have responded to the Court's request for the 

views of the Solicitor General in that 

particular case and acknowledge that there's a 

great deal of overlap between the question here 

and the question in that case involving 

exculpation provisions. 

And so I -- I take the point in the 

amicus briefs that third-party releases come in 

lots of different flavors.  As we've already 

made it clear today, that we do think that 

consensual ones we think are okay, even though 

nonconsensual ones are not.

are okay, direct claims are not, because the 

derivative claims are property of the estate.

           Exculpation clauses, depending on how 

they're written, may overlap a lot with this.

 We think that there is -- there -- there are

 similarities in the legal analysis.

 The Court would go about the same type 

of question, asking itself whether this is 

something that is consistent with the text's 

structure and traditional equitable authority 

that bankruptcy courts had.  There's also a 

common law immunity doctrine floating around in 

the context of exculpation clauses. 

I think the Court could say you're 

resolving a dispute like this, this is waiving, 

you know, prepetition claims that are property 

that is not property of the estate.  That's --

that's the -- this most egregious form of a 

nonconsensual release and leave that for another 

day if you need to.

But suppose, in fact, that the

that if -- if it really is that, and we know 

that it's everything, even though we haven't had

I -- I still think that it's important

 and -- and be subject -- that then they would

 get the release.  But I -- I think, if they were 

willing to do that, then maybe they get consent.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- it's possibly, you 

know, really a truly hypothetical hypothetical, 

but -- but it seems that your basic position 

would still apply if there was one kind of 

nut-case holdout, and -- and -- and so I guess 

I'm wondering why one nut-case holdout should 

hold up something like this. 

MR. GANNON: Well, and our -- our view 

is that if -- if that person is making a claim 

for an amount of money that they're never going 

to be able to get, then they should go to trial 

on that.  They should settle it. They should do 

whatever they need to do in order to deal with

 If it's a significant claim and 

somebody doesn't want to waive it, we think that 

you don't have to consider that person a nut 

case to say that it's their right to decide 

whether or not they get to waive their personal

 property rights.

their assets on the table, they still wouldn't

the bankruptcy.

 MR. GANNON: And that may well be a 

reason why it would still seem quite in --

 inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code for that 

deal to be approved.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right.  And then 

your discussion with Justice Alito about

 constitutional concerns, you mentioned due

 process. 

How about the Seventh Amendment, which 

you just briefly alluded to in response to 

Justice Kagan as well? 

MR. GANNON: We've -- we've raised the 

Seventh Amendment as a statutory argument in 

light of the provision of Title 28 that says 

nothing in the Bankruptcy Code will derogate 

from that in the context of wrongful death and 

personal injury claims.  So we do think that 

that's a significant issue here. 

And it's notable that this plan 

accounts for Seventh Amendment rights for people 

who have claims against Purdue but not for those 

who have claims against the Sacklers.  And so 

the amicus briefs discuss the Seventh Amendment 

itself more -- more extensively.

Your position's like there's no amount that they 

could do, but your rhetoric's been they haven't 

put in enough. 

On that point, isn't the discovery 

process that the bankruptcy court commissioned 

and oversaw that was very thorough at least from 

this perspective -- you may have critiques of it

help the ultimate creditors and victims?

 MR. GANNON: I -- I take the point 

that there was discovery into that.  There's 

more information about these assets than there 

usually is for assets that aren't property of

 the estate.  I take -- I take that point.

 Part of that was getting into the 

question of what the value of the fraudulent 

conveyance claims would be here. That's 

important information that's been available to 

the process, and the bankruptcy court had that 

information before it. 

But we still don't think that that's 

the same thing as saying that the Sacklers have 

actually made all of their assets available to 

the estate, that that's the big distinction, is 

that nothing in bankruptcy would let somebody 

say, you know, I'm insolvent because I have 

decided that only a certain portion of my assets 

should be used to pay my debt. 

The -- the deal isn't that.

say that --

problem and maybe the disconnect between you and 

the opioid victims is you're implying or even 

saying, oh, if you just can't -- reject this

 plan, there's going to be more money available 

down the road from the Sacklers. 

And I don't think you're accounting 

for the uncertainty of liability, first of all, 

the uncertainty of the indemnification, 

insurance, contribution claims, and the 

uncertainty of recovery. 

And so the point of this provision as 

it's been applied for 30 years is to take into 

account those uncertainties in thinking about 

whether this is a appropriate settlement and 

overall plan. 

So what's your response to that?

 response to questions about, you know, isn't

 this the best deal.  And I think that the record

 shows that what the best deal is here depends in

 large part on what negotiating leverage they

 have.

 And if the Court says that

 nonconsensual releases aren't part of that, the

 deal may change.  I certainly take the point

 that there's a lot of uncertainty, and all the 

people on the other side of this table and lots 

of other people have been involved in years of 

conversations about what the best possible deal

are not comfortable with being part of this 

proceeding as you have designed it.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One last question, 

which is you made a distinction between

 derivative claims and direct claims, which I

 understand from your brief as well.

 But I think the big theory of the

 other side -- and I touched on this earlier --

is that the releases here combined with the 

contributions to the res are helping the overall 

res because the -- the indemnification 

provisions would mean in essence that a suit 

against the Sacklers would be a suit against 

Purdue.  And you -- you touched on that earlier, 

but that's still a sticking point, so I just 

want to make sure I have that down. 

In other words, when they rope them 

into this plan, in essence, they're helping to 

protect the res because those suits would, if 

indemnified, deplete the res. 

MR. GANNON: Yes, I -- I -- I take the 

point. I -- I want to do make it clear that

 enumerated separately on page 274 --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.

 MR. GANNON: -- of the Joint Appendix.

 And the -- the lower courts agreed about the

 fact that there are some direct claims here.

 The indemnification provision, as I

 mentioned before, Justice Kavanaugh, it -- you 

know, that's something that doesn't apply to all 

of the claims that are at issue here.  Even to 

the extent that it does apply, there's a 

good-faith exception, and, therefore, it may be 

for naught. 

Even apart from that, under Section 

502, that it could be disallowed precisely 

because it's contingent, or there could be 

equitable subordination under Section 510, where 

it could be said that this claim should stand 

behind the claims of the victims, who should be 

able to take before the Purdue -- before the 

Sacklers can collect on whatever's left of their 

indemnification claim, which will only apply to 

some of these causes -- these claims against 

them and -- and to the extent that the 

good-faith exception hasn't been triggered.

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Gannon, explain 

to me how that will work, because I had this 

question about indemnification too, but it --

but it seems to me -- and maybe it's just I need 

to get a handle on what the sequencing would be

 here -- but let's say that the bankruptcy wraps 

up, but because some people have not -- and --

and let's imagine you win. Let's imagine the 

bankruptcy wraps up. Then people do go after 

the Sacklers, and let's say they secure 

judgments, and the Sacklers want to seek 

indemnification from Purdue. 

As I understand it, there's a division 

of authority in the courts below about whether 

these would be prepetition or post-petition 

claims and so whether they would even be 

allowed. 

But I also am wondering, what's left 

to get?  So, if they're bringing these 

indemnification claims, you know, and Purdue --

Purdue has been restructured, where are they 

going to get money anyway?  So I just don't

understand how it affects the res in the way 

that the Respondents say.

 MR. GANNON: Yeah.  Frankly, I -- I'm 

not sure where that would happen in this case, 

in part because of the question you have about 

whether these would be considered prepetition or

 post-petition indemnification claims.  I do 

think that equitable subordination could still 

be an answer here to the extent that any of them 

were prepetition. 

And, you know, I'm not sure how it 

would be resolved against a reorganized Purdue 

after the fact.  If it's a post-petition claim, 

then it -- it -- it may still be available 

against them. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But what -- if it is 

available against them, what assets are there to 

get once Purdue is reorganized --

MR. GANNON: Well --

I'm saying.

but I think that that's -- this is still 

depending upon lots of other questions about how 

much of the indemnification agree -- provision

 applies and --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I understand that, 

but I'm just saying, to the extent that they say 

this affects the size of the res, it doesn't 

really affect the size of the res that would be 

distributed during the bankruptcy proceedings so 

far as I can tell. And maybe Respondents can 

address that when they get up. 

MR. GANNON: May -- maybe so. I -- I 

-- I do think that the -- the good-faith 

exception is something that -- that plays into 

the question of valuing how much the 

indemnification claim would be to the extent 

that it is a prepetition claim and it's being 

estimated as part of the reorganization. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And then this 

other question is about the ramifications of a 

win for you.  I mean, we're talking about this 

in the particular context of the opioid 

litigation, but, you know, this -- this question 

about nonconsensual releases, nonconsensual 

nondebtor releases, has come up in other

talc litigation, et cetera.

 If you win, I mean, it just seems to 

me like this is a very complicated problem for a 

lot of the reasons that -- you know, a lot of

 the questions that people have been asking you 

about, well, is this the best that we can do for

 the victims?  Lots of victims have agreed to it 

for that reason, even though it seems like the 

amount that these victims who have agreed to it 

get, it's a pretty limited range. 

But, in any event, this is a very 

complicated problem in mass tort litigation that 

involves bankruptcy.  So what happens to those 

other cases if you win?  Does this have 

ramifications for other victims of mass torts 

that would be negative in cases like the 

Johnson & Johnson litigation?

MR. GANNON: Yeah, I -- I take the

 point. And I -- I would say that even in the

 Catholic Church cases, there have been Catholic 

diocese bankruptcies in the Fifth Circuit and 

the Ninth Circuit, and so they have proceeded

 without consensual releases.

 And, ultimately, as I -- as I alluded 

to before, there may not -- this may not be the

 best solution for every mass tort.  A single 

bankruptcy in which there are participants on 

the sidelines who are contributing may not be --

may not be the best solution.  If Congress wants 

to step in, as it did with 524(g), and create a 

customized framework for some of these 

individual case -- situations, it could do that 

consistent with --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And maybe that would 

be a good solution given the complexities, to 

have Congress do it rather than bankruptcy 

courts trying to stretch the code?

idea that Congress has the authority --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  That Congress --

MR. GANNON: -- to amend statutory 

authority.

And so the 97 percent in favor figure depends in

 part on a high, you know, nonvoting percentage.

 And -- but our -- our role is in 

making sure that the process is working as it's

 supposed to.  And so we're -- we're not the

 lawyers for these individual claimants.  They --

they have their own lawyers, some of them,

 before the case.  But we're -- we're speaking 

for the idea that if they have property rights 

that are not property of the estate, then 

that's beyond --

JUSTICE BARRETT: I understand that. 

I guess what I'm saying is, when you're talking 

about the property rights, you're referring writ 

large to maybe what we might call like some of 

the invisible debtors who just didn't vote, who 

didn't respond. 

MR. GANNON: Yeah -- yeah, and we 

think that that's -- that's definitely not 

consent in -- in a way that we think would make 

the -- this waiver appropriate.

mentioned the couple of decades of practice of

 bankruptcy courts approving these kinds of 

things, and I'm just trying to understand where 

the history leaves us, because I had understood

 that, under the previous version of the code, 

this Court in Callaway had said that this kind

 of thing is not acceptable.

 So can you just tell -- say a little

 bit about the history and how we should be 

thinking about that? 

MR. GANNON: Well, yeah we are saying 

that we think that this is a statutory 

construction case under the code, and we think 

it's inconsistent with the code for all the 

reasons that you and I were previously 

discussing. 

But part of that is because there 

isn't a strong historical analogue, and there's 

a really small amount of history that's been put 

on the table by the other side. 

And we do think that the Callaway case 

from this Court in 1949 certainly cuts strongly 

in the other way.  The other side says, well, in 

part, that was for jurisdictional reasons rather 

than -- than whether there was particular

not doing this under the Bankruptcy Act with --

you know, the only other cases that have been

 cited are a couple of district court cases that

 we think are -- are relatively easily to --

 relatively easy to distinguish from -- from a

 third-party release.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And, 

just conceptually, I guess I'm trying to 

understand why this would be laid at the feet of 

the one nut-case holdout, as Justice Kagan puts 

it. 

I mean, I -- I thought -- and maybe 

this is the argument that you're making -- that 

even if you have a group of people who do not 

consent, the Sacklers could still give the 

money. They could still fund the victims who do 

consent.  And so it's not the holdouts.  It's 

the -- the Sacklers' insistence on getting 

releases from every single person that's causing 

this problem, correct? 

MR. GANNON: That -- that's correct. 

And, as -- as I said before, to the extent that 

they say they want global peace, then I 

understand that desire, but that doesn't mean

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS PURDUE PHARMA L.P., ET AL. 

MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

This Court should reject the Trustee's 

argument that nonconsensual third-party releases 

are categorically unauthorized by the code no 

matter the circumstances. 

I'd like to begin with three points. 

First, the Trustee's position is irreconcilable 

with the plain text of Section 1123(b)(6).

Congress's use of "any" and "appropriate," terms 

of breadth and flexibility, refute the Trustee's

 position that third-party releases are never

 authorized in any circumstances.

 Second, this case illustrates how

 third-party releases can and do directly advance 

the core objectives of bankruptcy in appropriate

 and appropriately limited circumstances.

 Because of the inextricable 

relationship between Purdue and the Sackler 

directors and officers of Purdue, victims have 

filed identical claims against Purdue and the 

Sacklers for the same injuries based on the same 

conduct. 

Everyone agrees that the claims 

against Purdue can be channeled to the creditor 

-- trusts.  The releases simply prevent 

creditors  from jumping the line and depleting 

the estate through the back door by suing the 

Sacklers for the same injuries based on the same 

exact conduct involving Purdue.  That explains 

why the creditors and victims themselves 

insisted on and have overwhelmingly approved the 

releases. 

And, finally, third-party releases

than three decades, nearly the life of the

 current code, to resolve some of the most

 important and complex bankruptcies.

 Equity has likewise enjoined third 

parties in analogous circumstances for

 centuries.  Adopting the Trustee's categorical 

rule would radically disrupt that longstanding

 practice to the detriment of victims. 

If th Trustee succeeds here, the 

billions of dollars that the plan allocates for 

opioid abatement and compensation will 

evaporate.  Creditors and victims will be left 

with nothing, and lives literally will be lost. 

Nothing in the code commands that tragic result. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

 1123(b)(6) at all.  In order for that to be a

 component of the plan, it has to be approved by

 the bankruptcy court, and although he talks 

about the agreement of the parties, there has to 

be statutory authority for the bankruptcy court

 to include that.

 The only basis for that authority 

comes from 1123(b)(6), and that doesn't draw a 

distinction between consensual and 

nonconsensual. 

So I think my friend's response shows 

the -- the -- the difficulty with that position 

for him. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  If there were no --

if -- previous or prior indemnification 

agreement, would -- would your argument be the 

same with respect to the releases? 

MR. GARRE: It would be, Your Honor, 

because the -- for the simple fact that the 

sheer litigation of these claims against the 

Sacklers, because they must include on Purdue's 

own conduct to be subject to the releases, would 

inundate and overwhelm Purdue and deplete the 

res, and that's -- that's the simple fact due to 

the nature of these claims.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre, as I 

suggested to Mr. Gannon, I thought that one of

 the government's stronger arguments is this idea 

that there's a fundamental bargain in bankruptcy

 law, which is you get a discharge when you put 

all your assets on the table to be divided up

 among your creditors.  And I think everybody 

thinks that the Sacklers didn't come anywhere

 close to doing that. 

And the question is, why should they 

get the discharge that usually goes to a 

bankrupt person once they've put all their 

assets on the table without having put all their 

assets on the table? 

MR. GARRE: Right.  Well, let me first 

say, Justice Kagan, that the point of this 

proceeding is not to make the life as difficult 

as possible for the Sacklers.  It's to maximize 

recovery and fairly and equitably distribute it 

to the victims. 

Second, I think the more --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. But I guess 

what I'm suggesting is that this is a

 kind of extraordinary thing if we gave the power

 to -- to basically subvert this basic bargain in

 bankruptcy law.

 MR. GARRE: Right.  And -- and -- and 

that goes to my second point, Justice Kagan,

 which is that they're not getting a discharge.

 They're getting a release.  And there's a 

fundamental difference between that. 

A discharge under bankruptcy law is 

essentially immunity from all claims except for 

narrow exceptions, whereas the releases here 

apply only to one set of claims, prepetition 

claims by creditors based on the debtor's --

based on the debtor's own conduct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, in some ways 

MR. GARRE: That is not a discharge. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- in some ways, 

they're getting a better deal than the usual 

bankruptcy discharge because, as Justice Gorsuch 

indicated, they're being protected from claims 

of fraud and claims of willful misconduct. 

So, yeah, in some ways, they're

 MR. GARRE: So I think that

 underscores the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, again, without 

putting what I take to be, you know, anything 

near their entire pot of assets on the table.

 MR. GARRE: So, as -- as to the 

individual debtors, Your Honor, I think it 

underscores the fundamental difference between 

this reorganization proceeding and individual 

debtor proceedings, that the discharge -- the 

exception from discharge for fraud apply to 

individuals, not corporate reorganizations.  In 

this case, everybody agrees that the many claims 

for fraud against Purdue can be channeled to the 

trusts. 

And because -- and this -- that's 

because, in this reorganization proceeding, the 

focus is on maximizing the estate and equitably 

distributing it to all of the victims.  And what 

the Trustee proposes here is fundamentally at 

odds with that core objective of bankruptcy. 

And, again, as Your Honor's 

questioning pointed out, it doesn't matter how

much money the Sacklers would put into this.

 Their position is the same:  Nonconsensual 

releases can never be authorized by the code.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, even if they 

could be authorized, Mr. Garre, as you said at 

the beginning, why would this be an appropriate

 situation to allow it?

 So Justice Kagan says they're not 

putting all of their assets on the table. But 

my understanding is that not only are they not 

doing that, but most of the assets we're talking 

about were originally in the company and that 

they actually took the assets from the company, 

which started the set of circumstances in which 

the company now doesn't have enough money to pay 

the creditors. 

So even if there was a world in which 

categorically we -- we wouldn't say you can 

never do these kinds of releases, why wouldn't 

this be a clear situation in which we would not 

allow it? 

MR. GARRE: Well, first, the Trustee's 

position is it doesn't matter on the 

circumstances.  But this case actually 

illustrates exactly why these releases should be

 I mean, first of all, on the

 transfers, most of that -- 40 percent of that

 money went to paying taxes.  Of what's left, 97 

percent of that is in the $6 billion that's in

 this settlement.

 The -- the district -- the bankruptcy

 court here made careful findings that without --

this -- this -- this contribution not only was 

substantial and fair, but it was the best that 

was available here for the victims. 

And there are also serious collection 

issues that the bankruptcy court found, Justice 

Alito, that if this -- this settlement doesn't 

go forward, then victims would -- would likely, 

even if they prevailed on their claims, prevent 

serious issues about being able to collect on 

that at the end of the day. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Only because the 

Sacklers are just -- have taken the money 

offshore, right?  I mean, it's not like -- it's 

not like by operation of law it's necessary to 

do this.  It is necessary to do this because the

willing to give it back unless they have this

 MR. GARRE: So there are --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And I'll add to that 

if I could just piggyback on to what Justice

 Jackson said, the money -- I mean, I -- I take 

your point about 40 percent of the money that 

they took from the corporation going to the 

payment of taxes, but, as Justice Jackson 

rightly points out, the -- the 97 percent of the 

money after tax that they're contributing is all 

money that they took out of the corporation. 

And to your point to Justice Kagan 

about, well, this is a corporate restructuring 

and so the fraud provision doesn't apply, I take 

Justice Kagan's point to be, but if --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Individual. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- the Sacklers went 

into individual bankruptcy, which is what this 

is saving them from, those fraud exceptions 

would apply. 

MR. GARRE: So I think, I mean, first, 

on the question of individual bankruptcies, the 

Sacklers are not an entity. Many of them live 

overseas.  Much of what we talk about the 

Sacklers are actually trusts that aren't

talking about, you know, a very small number of 

individuals that even could declare bankruptcy.

 Their net worth of the -- the -- the Sackler

 directors and officers in the United States is

 about 1.2 billion.  The $6 billion obviously

 exceeds that.

 And, again, the Trustee acknowledged

 below that their position would be the same if 

the Sacklers were putting $10 billion into this

let me see if I can come at it this way.  So 

we're being asked to interpret 1123(b)(6), and 

you'd agree that the term "appropriate" doesn't 

mean anything goes, right?

And we would normally look for those limits, for 

example, in the structure of the Bankruptcy Code

don't have a Seventh Amendment objection here, 

Your Honor.  And the -- the plan itself 

addresses the Seventh Amendment.

 fiduciary duty.

 By virtue of bankruptcy law, those 

claims are taken away from the creditors, the

 third parties, put into states -- the estate and

 settled, even though, if they had held those 

claims, they would have gotten recovery

 directly.

 So that -- that history, no one 

disputes that here, my friend acknowledged it 

today, is fundamentally inconsistent with its 

position. 

Enjoining third-party litigation, this 

Court in the Celotex case recognized that 

bankruptcy courts can enjoin suits between 

nondebtors, specifically citing third-party 

releases in these sorts of cases. It cited the 

Dalkon Shield case.  The Energy Resources case, 

Your Honor, this Court recognized that 

1123(b)(6) applied in the context where what the 

release did was discharge the liability of a 

nondebtor, the officer of the company, to 

another nondebtor, the IRS. 

In fact, the -- the fact that

 its tax funds and discharge -- effectively

 discharge the liability of someone from IRS

 taxes is even more extraordinary than we're --

what we're talking about here.

 524(g), Your Honor, a situation where

 Congress specifically allowed these sorts of

 releases, if these constitutional concerns are

 real, then 524(g) is unconstitutional, and this 

Court, frankly, is going to take a wrecking ball 

to the bankruptcy code given the situations in 

which bankruptcy courts are allowed to dispose 

of, eliminate, defeat, stand in the way of 

property interests that you don't see outside of 

bankruptcy.  There's no question about that. 

And I think, with respect to a lot of 

these constitutional questions, they really 

ought to be dealt with on an as-applied basis.

 ways, neither side has satisfied me in answering

 that. I always thought that any release in 

bankruptcy would stop suits for derivative

 claims, correct?  Fraudulent conveyance claims

 are derivative claims that belong -- those 

claims belong to Purdue and those can be settled

 by Purdue, correct? 

MR. GARRE: So that's right, Your 

Honor, insofar as what the law does is take 

those away from the third parties, their 

property interests, just like the claims, the 

direct claims, and the state takes them over and 

can settle them.  So that's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I -- and I 

take it from the government's brief that the 

settlement can include an extinguishment of all 

derivative claims. 

I haven't understood why the personal 

injury claims are -- are not derivative claims 

also because, generally, these pills were sold 

by the corporation, not by the individuals.  And 

so I'm -- I'm a little lost as to why the 

personal injury claims are considered 

derivative -- I'm -- I'm sorry -- are considered 

direct.

MR. GARRE: Right.  I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I do understand

 that there's some consumer laws, state consumer 

laws, that could be viewed as direct claims, but

 I'm -- I'm sort of -- help me out.

 MR. GARRE: So, Your Honor, I -- I 

think one of the reasons why it's confusing is 

that because any direct claims that are subject 

to the releases here are functionally 

indistinguishable from the derivative claims for 

this reason.  The releases, as carefully 

narrowed by the bankruptcy court, only apply to 

claims that are dependent on Purdue's own 

conduct.  So this -- these --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's not --

that's not a definition in my mind.  I -- I -- I 

MR. GARRE: So -- so the definition, 

Your Honor, is that derivative claims apply to 

conduct that's, you know, generalized as to 

everyone.  Any creditor could assert that claim. 

So the claim that the Sacklers were involved in 

-- with Purdue in mismarketing OxyContin or --

or selling it to the wrong people, those are 

generalized claims.

The exception would be if you had a 

claim that one of the Sacklers, some of whom are

 doctors, say, sold OxyContin out of their dorm

 room, that would be a particularized claim to

 that consumer.  That would be a direct claim. 

But the claims here -- and I think what's 

significant is the Trustee -- no --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but that

 just -- all you're arguing to me right now, 

because you're still not helping me with a 

definition, is that that issue has to be 

resolved below, and it would be resolved in 

future lawsuits as to whether or not the 

bankruptcy agreement extinguished that 

particular type of derivative. 

MR. GARRE: Well, I -- I think that's 

important insofar as no one has ever really 

identified the -- the direct claim that's 

dependent on Purdue's conduct that would be 

released here. 

I mean, there were consumer protection 

claims.  All of the states have now -- are no 

longer opposing this settlement. So I think

 hypothetical, and a particularly bad reason to 

destroy this entire settlement is that they

 agree that all of the derivative claims can be

 released.  And what we're talking about is the

 extent to which the release applies to direct 

claims that the Trustee hasn't actually

 identified.

 But I think the more important point 

is that the Trustee's position is that any 

release, no matter the circumstances, is not 

allowed if it's nonconsensual, even in the case

your position, though, on that? 

MR. GARRE: Sure. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Because I guess I'm

Sacklers could condition their funding of this 

estate on anything that the code does not 

expressly prohibit. 

MR. GARRE: I -- I would say no

carefully at this.  And there are many 

limitations.  It has to be necessary to the 

reorganization.  It has to be appropriate --

he looked at is all the circumstances, including 

all the arguments about the Sacklers, and it 

looked to what was right to maximize the estate 

here and whether this release was necessary for

 the reorganization to avoid liquidation.

 So, if you take one of the

 hypotheticals in the U.S. Trustee's brief about 

the painting, the Sacklers had insisted on the

 reallocation of a painting or something like 

that, there's no way a bankruptcy court would 

approve that release.  The releases --

 theory, they could demand anything, Your Honor, 

but you have a bankruptcy court that has to make

 that determination.  You have an Article I court

 that has to make that determination.  You have 

over 30 years of experienced courts applying a 

very carefully set of factors that limit the

 availability of these releases.

 In this case, they were necessary

questions.  On the statutory point of the term

isolation, that's a broad term and really helps 

you, but, as the Chief Justice said in his first 

question, we, in interpreting statutes like that 

that assign broad authority to usually 

regulatory agencies, here, the bankruptcy court, 

we've been cautious, especially in recent years, 

about reading those to give too much authority, 

major questions doctrine, elephants in mouse 

holes. 

And I'm curious why in this case that 

those principles which go way back in -- in this 

Court's jurisprudence as I see it wouldn't apply 

here and say, yeah, "appropriate's" a broad

term, but we should read it narrowly because

 that would be a question of great economic 

significance that we won't assume Congress

 lightly assigned.

 MR. GARRE: Sure.  So the major

 questions doctrine is premised on

 separation-of-powers principles that apply to 

the delegation to executive agencies.

 This is a provision that applies to 

the courts, the Article III courts, an exercise 

delegating authority by the bankruptcy courts. 

"Appropriate" is a term of 

classic breadth.  It essentially gives the 

courts a common law -- law role that while broad 

is part and parcel of what bankruptcy courts and 

equity courts have been doing for centuries in 

this context. 

And I think that also answers why this 

isn't really a major questions problem.  This 

Court has never applied the major questions 

doctrine to a catchall provision that stands 

alone and has its own limitations --

And with respect, it's not an

fact that everyone agrees that the derivative 

claims, including intentional fraud claims, can 

be taken from third parties commandeered by the 

estate and settled.  It's -- it's -- it's 

consistent with what courts have been doing in 

enjoining suits between third parties for 

decades.  This Court in Celotex recognized that. 

It's consistent with equity practice.

not necessary to the reorganization, which makes

 this case completely different.  It was under a

 prior version of the code.  This code has much

 more authority.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On -- on standing, 

I take your point. This is somewhat of a side 

point, but I want to get it out. The U.S.

 Trustee doesn't have standing in your view, and

 I -- I think that's a strong argument. But 

Ellen Isaacs would have standing.  So do we need 

to get into the U.S. Trustee's standing given 

that Ellen Isaacs would have standing? 

MR. GARRE: So -- so we don't -- we --

think that she should -- she would, Your Honor, 

because she hasn't identified the direct claim 

that's dependent on Purdue's conduct that would 

be released that she could or would bring.  So 

we don't think that she actually has established 

standing, notwithstanding that she, like many 

other victims, have suffered tragic 

circumstances. 

But I think that the real problem, the 

other problem is is that what you're left with

you're doing is relying on standing of parties 

who have forfeited any challenge to the question

 presented, which would be a very odd thing for 

this Court to do to decide in this issue of

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Just one question, 

Mr. Garre.  So, if 1123(b)(6) is as broad as you 

say, did Congress need to enact 524(g) to give 

bankruptcy courts special authority to handle 

these problems in the asbestos context? 

MR. GARRE: Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Was that just 

clarifying, or was it necessary? 

MR. GARRE: It was necessary, but --

because what Congress did is it acted against 

the backdrop of courts allowing these sorts of 

releases and it recognized that, and then it 

says we need to have a further reticulated set 

of rules for asbestos particularly because of 

the unique problem presented there with respect

to future claimants, and so it enacted that 

special set of rules.

 And then it said in a separate act of 

Congress, hey, don't infer from this special

 scheme that the authority didn't already exist.

 And I think that that one-two punch makes it all 

the more important for this Court not to take

 that away from Congress.

 If Congress wants to establish a more 

reticulated set of rules for this, it can, but 

this Court shouldn't say, as Congress didn't in 

1994, that the authority doesn't exist at all 

given the plain text of 1123(b)(6).

mean, right before we have a bunch of specific 

grants of authority, and if (b)(6) means what

 catchall provision, Your Honor.  The point is

 that Congress said these are the things that we 

want to say you can do, but we want to be extra

 clear. We want to make clear the Court has all

 the power to do the things it needs to do as

 long as they're appropriate and not

 inconsistent.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And have -- haven't 

we normally said in our jurisprudence with 

respect to statutory interpretation that a 

catchall that ends after a list is sort of like 

in the same nature of the list?  It can't be 

just a totally different, huge thing. 

MR. GARRE: I think you would look to 

the other provisions, but just to be clear, this 

isn't like the fishing example that Justice 

Scalia gave, rods, reels, and other equipment. 

These are all things that grant authority, and 

then you have this catchall that does it as 

well. 

And I want to be clear.  The other 

provisions of (b) work directly with (b)(6) 

here. I mean, for example, (b)(3)(A) gives the 

estate the authority to settle the estate's own 

claims.

The releases here were necessary to 

the settlement of those claims, the bankruptcy

 court found at -- at JA 400.  And same too for 

(b)(5), which gives the authority of the

 bankruptcy estate to modify the rights of

 creditors.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  One final

 question.  With respect to "inconsistent" in

 (b)(6), what -- what is your view of the work of 

"inconsistent"?  I mean, can a plan provision 

that conflicts with the principles underlying 

the Bankruptcy Code be inconsistent, or is it 

your view that it has to be inconsistent with a 

particular provision? 

MR. GARRE: I think the text answers 

that, Your Honor.  It says inconsistent with 

applicable provisions. So you have to read all 

that together.  And I think, when you contrast 

that with "appropriate," you can't read 

"inconsistent" with such breadth that it 

swallows "appropriate." 

The "inconsistent" is doing a separate 

thing. It's saying look to other provisions and 

identify an applicable provision that this 

conflicts with.  And unlike RadLAX, Law, and

The U.S. Trustee does not speak for

insisted on the release of the creditor claims 

against the Sacklers for the same injuries to

 avoid a value-destroying victim-against-victim 

race to the courthouse that would result in no 

recovery for virtually all except the

 United States.

 That unrebutted finding grounded in a

 massive record built on years of creditor

 victim-led efforts refutes the Trustee's 

eleventh-hour speculation of some magic 

alternative permitting an equitable victim 

recovery. 

That is why the fact-finder relied on 

Section 1123(b)(6)'s broad terms to approve the 

tailored release as essential to restructuring 

the debtor-creditor relationship in this case on 

which lives literally depend. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

-- I guess it's a hypothetical on multiple

 levels because, one, it's not clear that the

 Sacklers are eligible for bankruptcy.

 But, if they did do that, there are a

 lot of questions that would need to be answered,

 including you would have dozens of different 

bankruptcies and you would have a free-for-all 

in competition of reconciling those assets.

 It would take years, probably decades 

if you talk to bankruptcy lawyers, for a victim 

to see a cent from that hypothetical bankruptcy. 

And I think this is important.  The --

the focus under the code, the principles of the 

code, isn't on a hypothetical Sackler 

bankruptcy.  Even the Trustee says the Sacklers 

as nondebtors aren't even part of the code.  The 

focus should be on the victims, the creditors. 

The Trustee tries to make this case 

about the Sacklers.  It is about the victims. 

All mass tort third-party releases over the last 

35 years -- the code has been in force for 45 

years -- over the last 35 years, all of those 

have involved wrongdoers, whether it's 

contraceptive devices, breast implants, or 

abuse.

not to serve justice in some abstract sense. 

It's to maximize the estate for fair and

 equitable --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Gannon --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let's -- let's

 assume that the -- the Sacklers actually filed

 for --

MR. SHAH: Yes. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- bankruptcy.  What 

would it look like? 

MR. SHAH: It's unclear what it would 

look like, Your Honor -- Justice Thomas, and I'm 

not trying to be difficult, but they're not even 

individuals, a lot of these.  These are trusts. 

They can't file for bankruptcy. 

If you took an individual Sackler that 

did, the question is, what are their eligible --

bankruptcy-eligible assets? As Mr. Garre said, 

the bankruptcy-eligible assets are about a 

billion dollars of the Sacklers. That's far 

less than the 6 billion that's put on the table. 

And then there would be a question of

So how do you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --

MR. SHAH: Yeah.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- here, you 

have basically the, what is it, 3 percent we're

 talking about of the individual claimants.  What 

if you have a situation where the 97 percent is 

a particular type of claimant, individual 

claimants, but the 3 percent that is holding out 

are different -- have different claims 

altogether, commercial claims? 

Could the individuals and the 

bankruptcy court force the commercial claims 

into the bankruptcy settlement? 

MR. SHAH: Right.  So, Your Honor, if 

the release tried to get rid of everything, but 

you had any class that didn't have a 

supermajority, that would almost certainly fail 

the Second Circuit's own test, which isn't 

challenged here, because you need a 

supermajority of the creditors, and as the cases 

that we have over the last 35 years, it's going 

to have to be of every class. Here, we have a 

supermajority --

MR. SHAH: -- only to this extent, 

Your Honor.  The code says "appropriate or 

inconsistent with any applicable provision." 

Courts for 35 years have given content to 

"appropriate."  One of the factors that 

virtually all of the courts have pointed to is 

supermajority approval of the creditors.

now I'm going to try to unpack the unrefuted and 

unrebutted findings of the district court.  You 

can read what the district court -- or the 

bankruptcy court said about it.  It's at JA 352, 

JA 365, JA 404, 405.  The Trustee did not object 

to any of those findings.  That's at Footnote 40 

-- 54 of the district court opinion.

This is the first time the Trustee is 

objecting to those findings, so let me unpack

 why -- I think it's time well spent -- why the

 district -- bankruptcy court made those 

unrebutted findings that there is no other --

forget a better deal -- there is no other deal.

 Here's why. Point number one, without

 the release, the Sacklers would not settle the 

estate claims, Purdue's most valuable assets. 

That's because of a classic collective action 

problem.  The Sacklers would face a tsunami of 

direct creditor claims outside bankruptcy 

without the release.  Just the cost of 

litigating those creditor claims would foreclose 

any reasonable settlement because they would be 

reserving for litigation of those. That's point 

one. 

Point two, without a settlement, the 

U.S. would gobble up the $1.8 billion in the 

estate right now with its $2 billion 

superpriority claim.  There would be zero 

dollars to victims out of the estate. 

Justice Barrett, you asked about that 

$2 billion superpriority claim, and just as 

Gannon gave a lot of answers how it's

contingent, let me be very clear, and you can 

see this in the record, it is not contingent on

 anything.  That $2 billion superpriority claim

 is an order of the court that is enforceable. 

It will gobble up the entire estate. There is 

no gray area about that. That leaves zero 

dollars to victims from the estate.

 So point number three, what does that

 leave? That leaves a liquidation trustee to 

litigate the estate claims, but he doesn't have 

any assets to litigate with, and he has to 

litigate that in competition with all those 

direct creditor claims that the release isn't 

preventing. 

So just to recap so far, we have no 

settlement, we have a Chapter 7 liquidation in 

which the U -- U.S.'s $2 billion priority claim 

eats up all assets, zero dollars for victims. 

You have their estate claims being litigated by 

a Chapter 7 liquidation trustee who has no 

assets to litigate them against plaintiffs' 

lawyers who are suing the Sacklers on all the 

creditor direct claims. 

Point number four:  If even one of 

those direct claims, creditor claims, gets to

brief, and your brief says the -- in your brief, 

you argue that all personal injury claims 

against the Sacklers are derivative of claims

 against Purdue, and so only a small subset of 

claims fall into the consensual -- nonconsensual

 third-party release of direct claims at issue in

 this case. 

MR. SHAH: Right.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's your brief 

at 54. 

MR. SHAH: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're telling

that there's only a few direct claims. So, if 

there's only a few --

MR. SHAH: Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- direct claims, 

how is that going to leave the estate? 

MR. SHAH: So -- so, Your Honor, that

all the direct claims are contingent on the 

release.  This is a collective --

 available path?  Just -- I know you hit on this, 

but I want you to finish that.

 MR. SHAH: Yeah.  So, yeah, so I -- I

 think this is critically important.  Whatever is 

available from the Sacklers, whether that's 

3 billion, 5 billion, 6 billion, 10 billion,

 there are about $40 trillion in estimated

 claims.

 As soon as one plaintiff is 

successful, that wipes out the recovery for 

every other victim.  That is why the victims 

insisted on this release.  As soon as one 

plaintiff is successful, they get the recovery, 

every other victim gets exactly zero dollars. 

That is the most fundamental point I think to 

understand.  That is why 97 percent of the 

victims agreed to this nonconsensual release. 

They have no love lost for the Sacklers. 

There is no body of victims, no one, 

who would more like to have retribution against 

the Sacklers.  DOJ obviously can prosecute them, 

hasn't, but the point is they can only get 

life-saving abatement and recovery dollars if 

there is a release, because, otherwise, the one 

plaintiff that jumps the line, hits the jackpot

first, wipes it out for everyone else.  That's 

about as simple as I can say it.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What about the

 abatement programs?  What -- can you talk about

 those briefly?

 MR. SHAH: Yes. The vast majority of 

the $6 billion that the Sacklers have

 contributed and the 1.8 that's in the Purdue

 estate, $7-plus billion, the vast majority of 

that is going to go to abatement. 

Fifty state AGs signed on to this 

plan, and the -- and the victims signed on to 

the plan because of the multiplying effect of 

abatement.  It will fund abatement, save lives, 

addiction, prevention.  All of those things are 

contingent on the release and the money that's 

going to come through here. 

As soon as the release goes away, for 

all of the reasons that I've said, and perhaps I 

was dramatic, but if you want an undramatic 

reading, read the bankruptcy court's unrebutted 

findings at the pages that I gave you. It lays 

out exactly what I did. I was trying to give it 

some color.

 happen.  That -- and -- and there isn't --

and -- and -- and -- and I say that jokingly, 

but it's not only legally improper for the 

Trustee to do that because it didn't object to 

any of those bankruptcy findings and the

 district court points out it didn't object to

 those.

 It's not only legally improper, but 

it's irresponsible for the Trustee now to 

suggest that there's some secret path to 

recovery for the victims.  It just isn't.  It's 

basic economics.  It's collective action. 

The creditors spent three years doing, 

as the bankruptcy called, the most massive 

investigation of the Sacklers that it's ever 

seen in any case.  Fifty state AGs, the Official 

Committee, every other victim and creditor group 

came together exploring every possible avenue 

and said that conjecture is false. 

There is no opportunity for a better 

deal. You can ask Mr. Gannon on rebuttal to 

point where is the evidence in the record that 

shows there is a better deal to be had. It does 

not exist.  Every piece of evidence, every

 just doesn't exist.  They are going to get zero

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What explains in

 your view then the United States' position given

 that it's not like them to read the word

 "appropriate" narrowly?

 MR. SHAH: Right, Your Honor. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. SHAH: Well, we -- we've been 

asking ourselves that question.  Look, if they 

have a legal -- they may have a legal objection 

to third-party releases.  That's fine.  I think, 

if you read 1123(b)(6), if textualism matters, 

it says it has two limitations:  It has to be 

appropriate.  It can't be inconsistent with 

applicable provisions of the code. 

It doesn't say inconsistent with some 

hypothetical bankruptcy.  It doesn't say 

inconsistent with general principles of the 

code. It could have said that.  In fact, 

Chapter 12 and 13 do say that. If you look at

Congress chose specific words here, 

and those words are "inconsistent with an

 applicable provision."  They haven't pointed to 

any applicable, specific provision that the

 third-party release here conflicts with because

 it doesn't.

 Instead, they go right to general

 principles of bankruptcy, this basic tradeoff

 of -- of -- of a -- of a debtor committing all 

its assets in exchange for a discharge. 

We don't have an automatic discharge 

here. We have a highly negotiated, tailored 

release that victim needs to get -- the victims 

need to get compensation that is safeguarded by 

all the appropriateness factors that judges in a 

common law fashion have done.

 nonconsensual releases.

 MR. SHAH: Right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And I think, if I 

agree with you or if I believe your forecast 

about what's supposed to happen or what might

 happen in this situation --

MR. SHAH: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- that there would 

never be a settlement of mass tort cases arising 

in those circuits, and the government has given 

several examples here of situations in which, 

once there's a rejection of a bankruptcy effort 

to take care of this, parties settle in tort.

right about --

 question directly.

 The -- the only example I heard today

 was the P& -- PG&E example out of the Ninth

 Circuit.  That had a far, far, far smaller body

 of claimants.  If you look at the actual mass, 

true mass tort bankruptcies where you have 

nothing near the funds available, like here, we 

have $1.8 billion in the estate, and we have

 $40 trillion of claims, those Dalkon Shield 

breast implants, those are only possible with 

third-party releases.  The other example they 

give, Justice Jackson, is the Arrow bankruptcy. 

That is not an insolvent -- or not a bankruptcy. 

It was outside a bankruptcy. That is not a 

solvent/insolvent entity. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But the -- nor --

MR. SHAH: That's backed by the VA. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- are the Sacklers. 

I mean, this is the problem that we're creating 

here, that we have half of it inside the 

bankruptcy, that's Purdue, and we have half of 

it outside the bankruptcy, that's the Sacklers. 

MR. SHAH: Right.

 Those are multibillion-dollar claims.

billion, contrary to all fact and the years of 

investigation, let's assume all 11 billion is

 somehow collectible -- by the way, that's false, 

JA 629, 32, whatever.

 Let's assume all 11 billion of it is

settle is because there would be dozens,

that same kind of agreement can't be made

 outside of the bankruptcy court. That's what --

my only point is --

           MR. SHAH: Exactly.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- we all got

 together and we agreed in the context of

 bankruptcy, why couldn't that same kind of

 agreement occur --

MR. SHAH: Be --

bankruptcy --

MR. SHAH: The --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- vis-à-vis the --

the claims against the Sacklers? 

MR. SHAH: And that's the critical 

question.  And the reason is the linchpin of 

that agreement, the consent from all 50 states 

and all the rest, the 97 percent that agreed, 

was that others couldn't jump ahead of the line 

and recover, the third-party release.  You can't 

get the third-party release outside of 

bankruptcy, which is why, for 35 years, courts 

have been doing it in mass tort bankruptcies 

like Dalkon Shield, like breast implants, like 

the abuse cases, in order to make it happen.

 Mr. Gannon?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. GANNON: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  If I could just make four points. 

First, Ms. Isaacs, Justice Kavanaugh, 

has been objecting to this release since the 

bankruptcy court, and she filed claims, to quote 

from her question presented, "on behalf of 

herself and her deceased son, whom she found 

dead from an overdose on her bathroom floor." 

All of her claims have been released.  We think 

that there is no doubt that she has standing 

here. And this idea that she has to specify the 

connection with this release is something that 

we haven't heard from the other side before.

difference between a derivative claim and a 

direct claim is whether it's a claim that is

 being recovered on behalf of all of the -- on --

on behalf of the corporation as a whole.  And so 

that's why the fraudulent conveyance claims, if 

anyone brought an individual fraudulent

 conveyance action against the Sacklers here,

 those all become property of the estate because 

the benefit of bringing that asset back into the 

estate goes to the entire corporation.  So 

Purdue takes over those claims. 

Purdue doesn't take over personal 

injury claims.  Those are not brought on behalf 

of the corporation.  If somebody gets a money 

judgment or some sort of relief for their 

individual claim, that's not something that 

accrues to every other creditor for the 

corporation. 

And, separately, I'd also say, you 

mentioned the consumer protection claims, which 

is what the Second Circuit said in Footnote 15 

are, at a bare minimum, the nonderivative claims 

here, there are individuals who also have state 

consumer protection -- state law consumer 

protection claims, and so those aren't all

included in the settlements with the 50 states.

 And, third, I would -- my friend says

 that this -- there's going to be this

 victim-to-victim -- victim-against-victim race 

to the courthouse which involves assets that are 

not in the bankruptcy. But the solution to that

 is not to say that everybody gets zero dollars 

in that race. The court can't just do whatever

 it takes to make this deal possible.  The court 

can't say, well -- if they could do that, 

Justice Kavanaugh, then the court could say, you 

know, what would be more appropriate, maybe more 

money, money that would be helpful to -- to this 

deal. 

And, as we've said, we don't think 

that the court can just say, you know, the 

Sacklers, we think it would be better if you put 

in $15 billion here if it's not money that is 

otherwise part of the estate. 

And so, finally, you know, we support 

an abatement-centric plan here, and we have a 

disagreement about whether there's a potential 

deal on the other side of the reversal by this 

Court. My friend on the other side says the 

bankruptcy court made findings about this, that

this was the best possible deal, that this 

release had to happen for that particular deal. 

That was a $4.2 billion deal. That finding was 

immediately falsified after the district court's

 opinion here.

 And with respect to the $2 billion, 

that $2 billion judgment that we have is part of

 a non-final plea that has not been finalized 

because we're waiting for the end of the plan to 

be confirmed here.  When it was accepted as part 

of a settlement before the bankruptcy court, it 

was contingent upon both the finalization of the 

criminal judgment and the confirmation of the 

plan. And so we think it's speculative to say 

that the $2 billion claim is going to eat up the 

entire estate. 

So, you know, we do hope that there is 

another deal at the end of this because this is 

something that needs to be worked out, but it 

doesn't necessarily have to be a deal with 

nonconsensual releases. It doesn't have to be 

one bankruptcy.  And we think the Court should 

say that the dealing should not proceed on the 

premise that nonconsensual releases are 

permissible under the Bankruptcy Code.
