 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 23-3, Coinbase versus

 Suski.

 Ms. Ellsworth.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSICA L. ELLSWORTH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The Federal Arbitration Act requires 

courts to enforce arbitration agreements 

according to their terms.  Respondents and 

Coinbase agreed to arbitrate any disputes about 

Coinbase services and to delegate to an 

arbitrator any threshold disputes about whether 

specific claims were subject to arbitration. 

Despite this delegation clause, the 

parties have spent nearly three years disputing 

this threshold issue.  That's because, instead 

of enforcing the delegation clause, the courts 

below came up with rationales to evade it and to 

instead answer the question of arbitrability for 

themselves. 

The Ninth Circuit did so by

characterizing Respondents' challenge as one of

 contract formation, asserting that contract

 formation can never be delegated and

 sidestepping the delegation clause.  The issue, 

as the court of appeals saw it, was whether the

 parties formed a contract to arbitrate these

 claims.

 If that approach were correct, courts 

in every case could ignore delegation clauses by 

just characterizing an arbitrability dispute as 

a question of whether the parties formed a 

contract to arbitrate the claims at issue. 

Respondents do not defend that 

reasoning.  They agree the contracts here were 

formed and that they were in effect.  Their 

argument is that the scope of the otherwise 

applicable arbitration agreement was narrowed by 

a later contract to exclude their asserted 

claims.  That question is one of arbitrability, 

and the parties agreed an arbitrator would 

decide it. 

Respondents blur three distinct legal 

questions in a case like this one.  The first is 

the merits of the claims the Respondents assert. 

The second is whether those -- the merits of

 those claims should be arbitrated.  And the 

third, which is the only question that was 

before the courts below and is before this

 Court, is who decides whether the merits should 

be arbitrated. This third question is

 antecedent to the other two.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Isn't the problem the

 confusion that results from the difference 

between the official rules and the agreement? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So, Your Honor, at 

some level, there is some confusion that the 

Respondents have argued results from looking at 

these two together.  But the only way there is 

confusion is if you conflate those different 

layers of questions because the -- the -- the 

delegation clause that's in the arbitration 

agreement answers directly the who decides. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what is the source 

of the disagreement here?  Doesn't it come from 

the -- the -- the rules? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So the source of the 

agreement is --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Disagreement. 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Certainly.  The source

of the disagreement is that there is a forum

 selection clause in the official rules that says

 something about controversies regarding the

 promotion.

 And the Respondents have argued that, 

by using that language, the second contract

 somehow carved out of the arbitration agreement 

the claims they want to assert here.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, couldn't this 

have been solved in drafting by simply either 

having an express arbitration provision in the 

official rules or by referring back to and 

incorporating the user agreement? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So, Your Honor, I 

think those are certainly questions that could 

be and should be addressed by the arbitrator 

when this gets there.  But -- but the threshold 

question is whether the confusion that Your 

Honor is referencing has anything to do with the 

who decides issue.  And there's nothing in the 

official rules language --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I think it goes 

a little deeper because you can also say, is 

there actually an arbitration agreement that 

comes out of the -- the rules?

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So -- so, Your Honor,

 I -- I don't think there is an arbitration

 agreement anywhere in the official rules.  The 

Respondents' argument is to try to take the 

official rules to create ambiguity about the --

or -- or -- or confusion, as Your Honor said,

 about what claims are actually subject to

 arbitration.

           JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  But that is a 

garden-variety arbitrability question.  It 

doesn't speak to the threshold, gateway who 

decides question. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: So can I ask you --

oh, go ahead.  Go ahead. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Go ahead. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you about 

the who -- who decides question? Because I --

I'm follow -- I think I'm following your 

argument, but I -- I guess I'm questioning 

whether you're right that the only way there is 

confusion is if you conflate the questions. 

So let me -- let me posit this 

hypothetical.  Suppose we have two contracts, 

the first of which has a delegation clause that

answers the who decides question, and the answer 

in the first contract is the arbitrator decides.

 We have a second contract that answers the 

delegation question, and the answer in that case 

is the court decides.

 In that situation, where you have

 these two different contracts with two different

 clear delegation principles, isn't the question

 at that point, which contract controls?  Which, 

you know, I take it is another way of the Ninth

that one.  But, really, it's a question at that 

point of what did the parties intend, what was 

their agreement about which of these two 

contracts controls the situation. 

And in that case, I think you go to 

the court.  Why -- why am I wrong about that? 

And isn't that the situation that's actually 

being presented on these facts? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So I think you are 

right about that, not wrong about it. And I 

think the distinction between your hypothetical 

and this issue in this case is -- is -- is a 

very important one. 

You're right about it because, in your

 hypothetical, you identified a -- a contract 

with a delegation clause and a second contract 

that isn't silent about delegation; it 

specifically addresses delegation and has a

 different provision.

 So a party could come into court

 resisting arbitration and make a specific 

challenge to the delegation clause in the first

 contract that is directed at whether that 

particular delegation clause has been superseded 

by the later delegation clause.  It's all at 

this who decides level. 

The problem in this case is that the 

-- from the very beginning, the Respondents have 

agreed this arbitration agreement remains in 

effect.  This delegation clause remains in 

effect.  It would cover these claims. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: I understand, but by 

operation of the law, don't we have the --

basically the same thing here?  Because the 

second contract is not completely silent.  The 

second contract says forum selection, go to --

you know, disputes go to the court. 

And I thought that by operation of 

law, when you don't speak to delegation in a

the delegation is to the court. So that, in 

effect, even though we don't have those words in 

the second contract, we basically achieve the

 same thing.  Am I wrong about that?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  I -- I think you

 are --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  -- just a little bit 

off about that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay. 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  And the nuance here, I 

think, is the exact nuance that this Court 

identified really going all the way back to 

Prima Paint but through Rent-A-Center itself, 

where it talked about the fact you can have 

validity challenges that are -- that occur at 

these different levels. 

So you can argue that there's some 

sort of invalidity or some sort of supersession 

that occurs at the level of the arbitration 

agreement.  You can also have one that occurs at 

the level of the delegation clause. 

And under the severability principle 

that this Court has consistently applied and

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can I -- keep

 going.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I'm -- it's all

 right. I'm done.

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  So the only -- only 

other point I would make that I think is 

important to understand about this is that a 

delegation clause by its very nature must reach 

more broadly than an arbitration agreement, and 

that's because, when you get to the del -- when 

you -- when you have the delegation and you end 

up in front of the arbitrator, sometimes the 

answer will be yes, this should be arbitrated; 

sometimes it will be no, it shouldn't be.  But 

the force of the delegation clause does not turn 

on the reach of the arbitration agreement. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So, from the reply 

brief, page 9, I located a point of possible 

agreement between you and Respondent on a remand 

possibility.  So you say on page 9 in the reply

that this Court provide as guidance because this 

is a situation, successive contracts come up not

 infrequently in all sorts of commercial

 settings, consumer settings.

 The first is that the severability 

principle applies just as much in a successive

 contract scenario as it does to a single

 contract scenario.  That means that the court

 can only entertain challenges directly to the 

validity or enforceability of the delegation 

clause itself. 

The second principle that I think 

would be important to explain is that delegation 

clauses can and regularly do direct an 

arbitrator to resolve disputes about whether an 

arbitration agreement exists and whether it 

covers a particular dispute. 

The third point I think that this 

Court should make in remanding it is that a 

court cannot refuse to enforce a delegation 

clause based on the court's view that a later 

contract changes the scope of what disputes are 

arbitrable because, as I said in -- to -- in 

response to your earlier question, the force of 

a delegation clause does not rise or fall on the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  These 

are huge changes. You are now creating a whole 

set of federal rules on what constitutes a

 superseding agreement or not. 

I don't -- we didn't grant cert on 

that. We granted cert on a very narrow 

question, and the narrow question was where 

parties enter into an agreement -- an 

arbitration agreement with a delegation clause, 

should an arbitrator or a court decide whether 

that agreement is narrowed by a later contract 

that is silent as to arbitration and delegation. 

I don't know whether the silence or 

not is relevant.  The question is what does 

state law do. We didn't answer -- we didn't ask 

for briefing on that.  The short answer is the 

court decides what state law says or doesn't 

say.

 Why shouldn't we just answer that question?  The

 Court decides it.  State law may guide the Court 

in whether there's been a superseding agreement, 

but we shouldn't be creating federal rules for 

the state to follow or not follow in

 interpreting contracts.

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  Justice Sotomayor, we 

are not asking for you to create any federal 

rules in resolving this case.  The severability 

rule is something this Court has applied 

consistently.  It has drawn directly from the

And all we're asking is that in -- in 

remanding this, you make clear that the 

severability rule applies here, just as it 

always does.

 doesn't mean that the delegation clause covers 

all of that, right?

 You could have a big enterprise and 

you have a delegation clause in a particular 

arbitration agreement, and there's a contract

 entered between the same parties somewhere down

 the line concerning a totally different issue. 

And do you think in that situation it still goes

 to the arbitrator --

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to decide 

whether he or she's been delegated the authority 

to arbitrate that agreement? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think there is a practical answer to that and 

there is a doctrinal answer to that. 

The -- the practical answer is that a 

-- a party only invokes a delegation clause when 

it thinks it has a real claim that the dispute 

is actually subject to arbitration. 

So -- so, for example, in this case, 

the Respondents have agreed that absent the 

official rules changing it, their claims are 

subject to -- to arbitration. So that's the --

that's the practical answer.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, put that

 aside. Well -- or, no, I'll answer it now. I 

mean, the parties invoke it or not depending 

upon how they regard their self-interest.  I 

mean, they may well have a favorable view of the

 person who is arbitrating or not.  They may well 

have a particular reason to proceed more

 promptly than litigation would.

 What is the internal limit that you 

have that says no, that contract is not 

sufficiently connected to why we have a 

delegation clause under the other one? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  Your Honor, when a 

party invokes a delegation clause, this Court 

unanimously in the Henry -- Henry Schein 

decision from a few terms ago made clear that 

courts have no power and no business answering 

the arbitrability question for themselves, even 

in a case where they think the invocation of the 

delegation clause was wholly groundless. 

We are a far cry from that scenario 

here. I think Your Honor's hypothetical where 

there are two contracts that really address 

totally disconnected scenarios might be closer 

to Henry Schein, but Henry Schein then, I think,

 And -- and as the Court said in that

 case, if someone really is frivolously or

 improperly invoking a delegation clause, 

arbitrators have ways to quickly move the matter

 back to court.  There may be sanctions

 available.  There are other tools --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but at 

some point, you get into the fundamental 

principle of arbitration that the parties must 

have agreed to turn something over to the 

arbitrator.  And it seems to me that if you get 

a contract that is way out of the -- however you 

want to describe it -- the scope, that saying 

it's up for the arbitrator kind of skips over 

that pretty important part.

this case, there is undisputedly a clear and 

unmistakable delegation clause of all disputes

Coinbase services. It is covered by the

 arbitration agreement as written.

 The question becomes does the -- do 

the official rules somehow carve out that

 particular set of claims from arbitration, but

 there's not a carveout from delegation.  And 

that makes sense because the purpose of

 delegation is to set up a streamlined, efficient

 process for resolving these arbitrability 

disputes. 

It is about consent to have an 

arbitrator quickly and efficiently tell the 

parties, does this dispute belong in court or 

does this dispute belong in arbitration? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But on the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  On the pure -- on the 

pure who question, which is what we agreed to 

review, you say on page 12 of your reply brief, 

"Coinbase agrees that the Court can and should 

assess whether the official rules displace the 

parties' consent to have an arbitrator decide 

arbitrability...".  I mean, that seems to answer 

and concede the who question. 

And then there is the what question. 

But we didn't grant review on the what question.

who decides, you've got arbitrability, and you 

have the merits.

 They pointed to a provision that talks

 about a court deciding controversies regarding

 the promotion.  This threshold question is not a

 controversy regarding the promotion.

 And I think that's why, in the 

district court, in the court of appeals, in this 

Court, the way Respondents see to get to a 

delegation invalidation is to argue that the 

arbitration agreement has been narrowed and 

there's been some corresponding narrowing of the 

delegation clause. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: Can we set aside the 

way they framed it?  Because I agree it's a 

little confusing if you start from the world of 

we have a delegation agreement, then we have a 

subsequent agreement, and the question is to 

what extent the subsequent agreement is a 

carveout or narrows or whatever. 

Let's say we don't frame it that way. 

Let's say we frame it in the way that I want to 

-- want to think about it, which is we have 

contract A that absolutely answers the who 

decides question, and then we have contract B

that implicitly decides the who -- who decides 

question, because I understood by operation of

 law, based on basic -- you know, what the Chief 

Justice was saying, is that if you don't pick 

arbitration, if you're silent about it, then the

 background rule operating is that arbitration is 

not what happens and any question about whether 

or not arbitration is what happens, the who 

decides, goes to the court. So we have contract 

number 1 that is picking arbitrator is the one 

who decides, and we have contract number 2 that 

is implicitly picking court is the one that 

decides.

beginning that in that situation, it's a 

question for the court.  And that's what we're

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No.  What you're

 doing is you're invoking contract 1. So --

MS. ELLSWORTH:  That's right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- what I'm saying,

 he's invoking contract 2. We have two people 

running in with contracts, one of which suggests

 that this is supposed to be decided by the

 court. The other is -- suggests that this is

 supposed to be decided by the arbitrator. 

And so, in that situation, isn't the 

question which contract controls in this 

situation? 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  So, Justice Jackson, I 

-- I think it's important to figure out what the 

correct starting point is. And I think one of 

the remaining places of daylight between the 

Respondents and the Petitioner here is what the 

right starting point is. 

We say the right starting point is the 

arbitration agreement that we seek to enforce. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah. 

MS. ELLSWORTH:  And, here, that is the 

delegation clause in the first contract.  That 

delegation clause, under the -- the 

straightforward operation of Section 2 of the

FAA, remains valid, enforceable, and irrevocable

 unless they can make some state law challenge 

that would displace it.

 And so the question becomes -- and 

this is the analysis the Ninth Circuit didn't do 

-- have they -- by pointing to the forum

 selection clause that talks about resolving 

controversies about the promotion, have they

 done anything under state law to displace the 

who decides delegation clause in the first 

contract? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, can I ask 

you just a practical question?  I fully 

appreciate your argument that parties might send 

to the arbitrator the question of who decides 

and, at the same time, have the -- the merits 

decided in one place or the other, even within a 

single arbitration agreement.  The arbitrator 

decides whether agreements go to court or 

arbitration.  Some will; some won't.  I get 

that. 

I guess I'm a little curious why your 

-- your client is fighting this so hard if at 

the end of the day you're going to wind up 

saying, yeah, sweepstakes disputes go to court.

So, if the arbitrator is going to have to send

 it to court anyway, why -- why are we here?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  So, Your Honor, that's 

the practical point that I tried to make in

 response to the Chief Justice.  I think, if we 

thought this was going to end up back in court, 

we wouldn't have invoked --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, I -- I --

MS. ELLSWORTH:  -- the delegation 

clause. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I fully 

appreciate that, and I also appreciate that 

under Schein that an arbitrator has -- could 

sanction you for frivolous effort to keep this 

in arbitration.  My question is more practical 

than that even and more nitty-gritty. 

Why in this case are you fighting it 

when you have this second agreement that would 

seem to route -- I -- I accept maybe the 

arbitrator should have decided this.  I'm -- I'm 

spotting you that.

we have very good reasons --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I know that.

 What are they?

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  I'm -- I'm happy to --

to talk you through a number of them. One is

 that this provision is in the contract.  It

 applies to mail-in applicants who participate in

 the sweepstakes that way.

 The second is that the contract -- the 

-- the official rules speak about jurisdiction, 

and a motion to compel arbitration and an 

arbitration agreement are not about removing the 

jurisdiction of the court. 

It speaks to -- to personal 

jurisdiction.  Really, that's what paragraph 10 

is about.  And we don't think it operates as a 

carveout on the arbitration agreement's scope in 

the way that the Respondents have argued. 

So -- so those are exactly the points 

that we would make to an arbitrator.  And I 

think Henry Schein makes clear an arbitrator may 

agree, it may disagree with us, but the 

arbitrator gets to make that decision in the 

first instance.

Mr. Harris?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. HARRIS, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 I'm going to abandon what I planned to 

talk about and try to answer Justice Gorsuch's

 question.  Why are they fighting this so hard? 

And that only occurred to me within the last 

week or so. 

And the answer is there's a strategic 

reason.  They want the Court -- they don't care 

who decides arbitrability.  All they care about 

is how arbitrability gets decided because that's 

what goes to liability at the end of the day. 

And so the plan is we need the Supreme Court to 

overrule the Ninth Circuit's weird "existence" 

language. 

Why do they need that and that only? 

The reason is that "existence" language 

originated from the Goldman Sachs case that was 

cited in our Ninth Circuit opinion.  The Goldman 

Sachs case was somewhat similar to this case in

 agreement to litigate.

 The Ninth Circuit was looking at that

 situation and thinking:  Shoot, we're bound to

 apply the old presumption in favor of

 arbitrability under federal law, but we know 

that as a matter of contract law, there was no

 real, mutual intent to arbitrate this dispute 

under the most recent, most specific agreement.

 So they made up a new federal rule. 

Oh, this is a formation dispute, this is an 

existence dispute, so that they could avoid the 

presumption of -- in favor of arbitrability and 

do the right thing under state law. 

We've gone to great pains to argue 

that non-preempted state laws are what apply 

here because, at the end of the day, those are 

the only laws that are capable of accurately 

discerning the parties' true intentions, no 

matter what type of contractual mess gets thrown 

in front of judges. 

It's impossible to make one federal 

rule, two federal rules, three federal rules 

that are going to accurately discern the 

parties' contractual intentions in -- in an 

infinite number of business situations.

 Traditional state law can do that.  And we ask 

that the Court apply that here and welcome to

 answer any questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But why wouldn't a --

a later agreement that modifies the earlier

 contract simply go to what the scope of the

 agreement is?

 MR. HARRIS: So it goes to two scopes. 

It goes to the scope of the agreement to 

arbitrate the merits of the dispute, and in our 

position that we've tried to brief very heavily 

is that it goes to the scope of the agreement to 

delegate this arbitrability dispute to the 

arbitrator. 

And our reason for doing that is that 

under Granite Rock, consent to arbitrate is 

dispute-specific. If that's true in the context 

of an arbitration agreement, it also has to be 

true in the context of a delegation agreement. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But -- but, counsel, 

the arbitration agreement, you concede, is still 

operative, right? 

MR. HARRIS: For -- for disputes 

unrelated to the sweepstakes, absolutely. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  Well --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That's what it says,

 And I -- I guess my question for you 

is the inverse of the one I asked your friend on 

the other side.  The point in Schein was, if you 

agree to say the arbitrator gets to direct 

things, if this were all in one contract, it's 

possible some things would be arbitrated, agreed 

to arbitrate and some things would be -- you 

agree to send to court.  And if it were in one 

contract, there's no doubt that the arbitrator 

would decide which -- which direction to route 

things, right? 

The only question is does the second 

contract make this different than it being in a 

single contract.  And I struggle to see why that 

would be the case.  And I furthermore struggle 

to see why you would care because your real 

argument is that the agreement is to litigate 

this in court.  And the routing, who's going to

 MR. HARRIS: Well, we've -- we've

 already won in court.  We've already won

 arbitrability in court.  And they haven't

 challenged that here.  So the only way they

 resurrect the arbitrability dispute at all is by 

winning the delegation agreement.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  My question is,

 though, if -- if -- if you -- if you think you 

can win on -- on where this goes, why didn't you 

just go to the arbitrator to get a quick answer? 

Why -- why -- why litigate it all the way to the 

Supreme Court of the United States? 

I'll try it one more time. 

MR. HARRIS: So -- so, I mean, I guess 

I'd have to go back and think about why I did it 

in the trial court, why I did it in the --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

MR. HARRIS: -- in the Ninth Circuit. 

But, here, so arbitrability, not delegation, 

arbitrability is finally resolved by the federal 

courts because -- unless this Court sends that 

dispute back to an arbitrator.

So, if we had one contract that just

this case to the Ninth Circuit..."

 Are you -- I'm asking the same

displace the other contract, which could involve

Circuit's analysis was wrong.  I do not view 

that part of what they said as what controlled 

their analysis.

 heading was.  But they have a heading for

 delegation clause. 

Under that, Coinbase had argued that,

 well, this is a dispute about the scope of the

 arbitration agreement, and, therefore, that's 

the end of the analysis. It must go to the 

arbitrator.

 The Ninth Circuit said:  Wait a 

minute, we're going to actually ask whether that 

scope language was intended to apply to a future 

contract like this one that says court only, 

that has a different set of parties. 

So -- so all that to say, they did 

directly address the delegation question before 

reaching arbitrability.  And that's correct 

under Henry Schein. 

And they also, in addressing 

delegation, the question they answered is, is 

this delegation clause intended to be applicable 

to this arbitrability dispute? 

And that's -- that's one correct 

question to ask under Granite Rock because 

arbitration is always dispute-specific.  It's --

we can't just label this an arbitrability 

dispute and move on.

We can't do that because it's also a

 forum dispute.  It's also in substance a dispute

 about the official rules.  We don't actually

 agree about the scope of the user agreements. 

We disagree about the scope of the official 

rules of the June 2021 sweepstakes. How is that 

not a controversy regarding the sweepstakes as

 to arbitrability?  It's about the arbitrability

 of the sweepstakes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think --

MR. HARRIS: And that was intended for 

the courts. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- do you think that 

the Ninth Circuit decided whether the official 

rules supplant the original arbitration 

agreement's delegation clause? 

MR. HARRIS: No.  And that -- that's 

where I think they went wrong if anywhere. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that -- so -- so 

you think that this is not like, oh, they just 

forgot to put in a sentence.  You think that 

they never addressed that question? 

MR. HARRIS: Correct.  They stopped at 

the question before it, which is, look, we don't 

even have to reach the official rules because

 meant to cover this.

 applicability decision that is

 delegation-specific.  That's not preempted by

 the FAA.  They haven't -- they haven't addressed

 it at all. 

They haven't addressed it under state

focus on this existence language so that they 

can go back and down and say, hey, this 

existence rule no longer exists, and, by the 

way, that was your excuse to apply state law. 

Now you have to apply the presumption in favor

-- the user agreement -- the -- the sweepstakes

 agreement superseded that.  And you're saying 

the Ninth Circuit didn't do that.

 MR. HARRIS: Right.  And -- and in my

 view, they didn't necessarily have to because 

they asked whether the delegation clause was

 applicable to this arbitrability dispute about

 the sweepstakes.  They -- they looked at the

 delegation clause and they said: This wasn't 

intended to cover this particular arbitrability 

dispute.  And so they said it's not delegated. 

But, to -- to some of the Justices' 

point, if we look at just the language of the 

delegation clause, it's broad enough to cover 

any arbitrability dispute.  So the safer, better 

way to address this delegation question is were 

the official rules intended -- or -- or -- or 

did the official rules have the effect of 

modifying the delegation clause as to these 

types of arbitrability disputes? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I -- I -- I 

just -- I'm struggling.  I -- I -- I certainly 

see the argument that the second agreement 

modifies where this thing should go and should 

be resolved and by whom ultimately.  But I think

you've just conceded over and over again that 

the first agreement says those questions go to

 the arbitrator and it's broad in scope and it 

covers everything, all relationships with 

Coinbase. So you want us to vacate and remand 

for more proceedings in the Ninth Circuit on 

whether that first agreement modifies the second 

rather than just going to get an answer from the

 arbitrator. 

MR. HARRIS: I mean, remand is not our 

-- our first request. Our first request is to 

affirm the judgment and -- and just make clear 

that that "existence" language isn't the way to 

go about it. The way to go about it is ask 

whether the parties intended the delegation 

clause to apply to this arbitrability dispute.

Circuit's arbitrability decision.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Ellsworth?

        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JESSICA L. ELLSWORTH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. ELLSWORTH:  I think, as Justice

 Sotomayor's question made clear, this case needs

 to be remanded.  The Respondents and the 

Petitioners are in agreement on that.  We're 

here because the Ninth Circuit failed to apply 

the FAA's federal severability framework and, as 

a result, failed to do the state law analysis as 

applied to the delegation clause that it was 

required to do.  The Ninth Circuit never asked 

whether the later contract specifically overrode 

the delegation clause under ordinary state law 

principles. 

And, Justice Jackson, I think some of 

your questions were getting at how a delegation 

clause could actually be overridden in a later 

contract.  And I just want to respond to that 

briefly because I think it could be expressed as 

it was in one of your hypotheticals.  It 

could -- a later contract could wipe out 

arbitration entirely from the parties' business

principles, also wiped out the delegation

 clause.  There could be a merger agreement -- a

 merger clause.  There are a number of ways in

 which it could happen.  The fact is that none of

 them happened here.

 Everyone agrees the Ninth Circuit 

didn't decide if the second contract displaced 

the delegation clause and, instead, just made a 

ruling on arbitrability.  As I think my friend's 

argument shows, and it's important for this 

Court on remand to make clear, lower courts 

cannot collapse the who decides question and the 

Section 2 analysis for a delegation clause with 

the later arbitrability question. 

Justice Gorsuch, in response to your 

question about what an arbitrator would say 

here, one other thing to note is that the only 

Ninth Circuit case on point specifically finds 

that a forum selection clause does not displace 

a delegation clause.  That's the Mohamed case. 

It's one of the many reasons that we think these 

operate on different levels. 

Just like in the Prima Paint case, 

where fraud in the inducement could operate 

differently at the level of the contract and at

the level of the arbitration agreement; in

 Rent-A-Center, where unconscionability could 

apply differently at the contract level, the

 arbitration agreement level, and the delegation

 clause level; so too here the forum selection 

clause could apply differently, and it's

 important that the Court address it at the 

specific who decides layer.

 For all of these reasons, we think the 

Court should reverse and remand. Thank you very 

much.
