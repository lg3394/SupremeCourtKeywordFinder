 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-1079, Truck Insurance

 Exchange versus Kaiser Gypsum Company.

 Ms. Ho.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

If anyone is a party in interest 

entitled to be heard in this Chapter 11 case, 

it's the insurer, Truck, who will pay virtually 

every dollar the debtors owe the asbestos 

claimants. 

Yet, the Fourth Circuit's rule denies 

that insurer a voice.  That rule, which my 

friends barely defend, violates the text, 

context, and history of 1109(b). 

It also defies the practical reality 

that Chapter 11 cases are, as this Court has 

recognized, collaborative, working best when all 

stakeholders come together at the outset to hash 

things out. 

Congress recognized that reality and

 spoke expansively in 1109(b) to extend the right

 to be heard to any issue.  Congress also gave 

courts a duty to ensure compliance with the code 

and invited broad participation to help

 discharge that duty.  1109(b)'s breadth is a 

feature, not a bug.

 It's now common ground that a party in 

interest is one who could be directly and

 adversely affected by the case.  That's Truck in 

at least two ways. 

First, it's the insurer paying the 

vast bulk of claims against the debtors.  In the 

government's terms, it's a contracting party. 

From the start then, Truck's rights could have 

been directly and adversely affected by this 

case. The proof of that pudding is in the plan 

finding, which resolved key -- a key coverage 

dispute against Truck. 

Second, Truck's a creditor for 

millions in insurance deductibles. 

For both reasons, 1109(b)'s plain 

terms entitle Truck to be heard on any issue. 

In silencing Truck, the Fourth Circuit 

violated those terms by limiting who a party in 

interest is and what issues they can raise.

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Ho, at what point 

do you determine the status of party in

 interest? 

MS. HO: Thank you, Justice Thomas.

 At the -- at the outset. Section 1109(b)'s text

 refers to "be heard under any issue in [this] 

case." So we think that has to be an ex ante 

inquiry, in part because there are other 

provisions of the code apart from 1109(b) that 

affect parties in interest that don't depend on 

a specific plan or any plan. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the -- in this 

case, the -- the determination at the end or --

or in -- was that Truck was not negatively 

affected.  How could you determine that at the 

-- at the beginning of the proceedings? 

MS. HO: Yes, Your Honor, because I 

think the question should be "could," could --

could the entity be affected by the Chapter 11 

case. And as the insurer, there are any number 

of ways that Truck could have been affected.  It 

could have been affected by a plan that -- that 

resulted in one, as we were seeking, with fraud 

prevention measures, or it could have resulted,

 We -- we came into this Chapter 11

 proceeding as a creditor.  The proceeding could 

have resulted in our claims being impaired or 

unimpaired. And you don't know that until the

 end, but that doesn't -- the -- the language of 

1109(b) speaks to a creditor. So, if you're a 

party in interest in the beginning with a right 

to be heard under 1109(b), then you're a party 

in interest all the way through --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if --

MS. HO: -- Justice Thomas. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT:  I -- I -- I 

know there's -- we could have some back and 

forth about the facts, but in a hypothetical, 

let's assume that your client, whichever plan --

you know, there's three different plans on the 

table, and under every one, your client gets --

you know, the -- his exposure is exactly the 

same. It makes no difference to him which 

particular creditors are going to get what. 

He's -- just given the factual situation, he's 

going to walk away with exactly what he has or 

what he doesn't have when it's all done.

In what sense is -- does he have an 

interest in how his assets are distributed or --

or what the liabilities are?  In other words,

 although he is -- you could identify where he is

 going to, you know, be on the hook or not on the

 hook, but at the end of the day, everybody

 agrees it's not going to make any difference.

 Now does he get -- still get to

MS. HO: Yes, Your Honor.  And this 

goes -- Mr. Chief Justice, this goes to, I 

think, the colloquy I was having with Justice 

Thomas about the importance of the ex ante 

determination of who a party in interest is, 

right? It's somebody who could be directly and 

adversely affected.  And I think one may --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, under my

know that, Mr. Chief Justice, is because, if you 

look at 1109(b), one of the entities that's

 expressly listed is a creditor.

 And we also know that different 

provisions of the code, it matters whether you

 are impaired or unimpaired, right?  So, in other 

words, you don't get a vote on a plan if your

 interests are not impaired. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and we 

also know --

MS. HO: But that is different than 

being heard, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. We also 

know that in these proceedings, there are some 

creditors that are just not going to get 

anything because of their particular status and 

all that. Now I suppose you want to say these 

-- technically, under the rule, he can go in, 

and maybe that's a difference in this case.  But 

is -- is the -- a party in interest, is the same 

test for that Article III? 

MS. HO: That's our position.  Our --

our position, which is the position adopted by 

the Third Circuit, is that the test for that is

 Article III, if you're not going to be injured 

at all because the proceedings -- you know 

you're not going to get any money or you know 

you're not going to have any left or whatever it

 is, I don't know that that would satisfy Article 

III just because people are going to be fighting

 about who gets your money.  But the one thing 

that's clear, it's not going to be you. 

MS. HO: Well, I think, though, you 

don't know that.  You don't know that at the 

outset of -- of -- of the -- of -- of the 

proceeding, right?  So a creditor does not know, 

a party in interest or an equity holder does not 

know, and even the debtor doesn't know --

you just suggested, at the outset, there's going

 to be a lot of things you don't know.  You don't

 know what the plan is going to be.  You don't 

know whether the plan is going to affect you,

 injure you or not.  You don't know -- you know, 

all the things that we think of in the standing

 context:  Is there imminent injury?  Is there 

some traceability? At the outset, many people

 won't have the answers to those questions. 

So I guess I can understand an "at --

at the outset" rule, and I can understand an 

Article III rule, but I'm not sure I can 

understand both of them together. 

MS. HO: Sure. Two points to that, 

Justice Kagan. 

To -- to start, you know, we -- we do 

think that party in interest is coextensive with 

Article III, but you -- you wouldn't -- you 

wouldn't have to agree with me on that to agree 

in terms of what -- who a party in interest is 

under -- under the statute. 

But, secondly, I -- I do think there 

is a good fit --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So your first answer 

is you're willing to give up the Article III?

Article III.  We do think it's -- it is -- it is

 coextensive, as the Third Circuit has held for a

 dozen years, and I don't -- I don't think 

there's any tension between that and ex-ante. 

I think the -- the way to think about 

it is it's -- it's -- it's basically do you have 

standing and does disaggregating that from the 

merits, right, what a plan will actually do or 

how the proceeding will actually unfold. 

In the same way that this Court, you 

know, doesn't let the standing inquiry determine 

the merits, I think this -- it operates the same 

way in 1109(b) in the party in interest 

discussion and analysis, is that you're looking 

to see could -- could these proceedings directly 

and adversely affect it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we -- can I --

MS. HO: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- break this

 down?

 There are various points at which you 

decide standing. One is at the beginning of the

 suit. And I think what -- this is not an 

Article III court.  This is an Article II court. 

And it's not even a full court because it can't 

do everything an Article III court can do. 

It's closer, not quite, to an 

administrative proceeding.  But it's an Article 

II court.  And, generally, a -- a party in 

interest is anyone that could be affected by a 

plan. The plan hasn't come into effect, but you 

could posit a thousand different ways that a 

plan could directly financially injure someone. 

The Chief is positing a case where 

there's just not enough money, they're never 

going to reach down here, but you don't know 

that because you don't know what claims are 

going to be disallowed, whether some priority 

claims are not going to be accepted.  There's

differently from the Debtors' other debts with

 no reasonable basis to do so, that could breach 

the Bankruptcy Code, good faith and fair

 dealing, correct? 

MS. HO: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So now 

it's possible after we go through all of this

 that the court below will say:  No, it doesn't 

breach it, but you have a right to be heard on 

that. That's what you're saying.  That's the 

standing, correct? 

MS. HO: Yes, yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that's the 

difference between you can't flip things and get 

to the merits in that way, you have to look at 

that standing issue on the basis of the moment 

the plan is there, I am being affected by the 

plan. 

It's possible that that affect won't 

rise to the level of something that I will be 

given something to, but I have a right for them 

to hear me out on this, correct?

 otherwise think Congress would not have wanted

 to be a party in interest?

 MS. HO: No, Your Honor.  And --

and -- and to be clear, we are -- we are more 

than happy to embrace a holding of this Court 

that we are a party in interest who can be heard 

on any issue because of the insurance contract 

that we hold. So I want to be clear on that.

 But I think, to your point about 

the -- the floodgates argument that my friends 

raise, I don't think so, because I think the 

direct and adverse test which we believe is 

coextensive with Article III, it -- it has 

teeth. Again, it has been the rule in the 

Twelfth Circuit for over a dozen years.  And I 

-- I -- my friends on the other side really 

can't point to any sort of chaos that has 

resulted from it. 

So I -- I think our -- our test has 

teeth. And I -- and I also think that Congress, 

again, as I started by saying, I think the 

breadth is -- is a feature and not a bug here, 

that Congress wanted to bring stakeholders to 

the table, parties in interest who had a stake. 

And if anyone -- if anyone has a stake in this

And -- and who the plaintiff is in a 

bankruptcy case, I don't know, maybe the 

petitioner, right, but normally we say someone

 objecting to relief under Bond, under Clapper,

 doesn't have to establish Article III standing. 

And that would seem to be a closer fit to a

 party or a group like yours seeking to object to

 a plan.

 MS. HO: I certainly don't disagree 

that in -- in -- in the context where what you 

have is someone who is only objecting, right, to 

the relief being sought, and -- and that is us

it's pretty speculative.

 You might be able to articulate a way

 that the plan could adversely affect your 

interests, but it would be speculative. And so 

maybe we don't have to say whether Article III 

applies in Article I courts, but if I think you 

might have a problem satisfying Article III, I 

think I would still have to say you have

 statutory standing, right? 

MS. HO: Yes. I -- I think there's no 

-- there -- I don't believe there's any dispute 

that we have Article III standing here and in 

the court below because we weren't heard, and so 

we're challenging that we -- we were not -- were 

not heard. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yes. 

MS. HO: I do think, in terms of the 

Article III issue, the Fourth Circuit did 

address our creditor issue in Article III terms, 

but I think what that court was really doing was 

it was reading any issue out of the statute. 

So I think from the -- this Court's 

perspective, I don't think there's any question 

about our Article III status.  I think the 

question is, are we a party in interest?  We --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.

 MS. HO: -- that's directly and

 adversely affected.  The government says it's

 because we have an executory contract.  Either 

way, I think we -- we satisfy the statutory 

standing and we also satisfy Article III

 standing here.

           JUSTICE BARRETT: Oh, I see what 

you're -- I mean, I get what you're saying. I'm 

just saying, if I don't want your test, if I 

don't want to say that the statutory standard is 

coextensive with Article III --

MS. HO: Yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- that's -- that's 

the issue that I might have. 

And then just very briefly, could you 

describe for me for the uninsured claims what 

exactly -- I mean, you know, the -- you know, 

Kaiser and the -- the Claimants are fighting 

pretty hard to keep the insured claimants out. 

So what exactly are the fraud 

protection measures that would apply to the 

uninsured claims, the ones that you want to 

apply to the insured claims as well?

 two, Justice Barrett.  The first would require

 all claimants to disclose all known exposures --

 reorganization table, and once they're at the 

table, they can be heard on any issue in the

 case. And that status must be determined ex

 ante, that is, before the court considers the 

questions, because the right is to be heard in

 advance.

 That doesn't depend on the merits of 

the position, and it cannot be determined based 

on what a plan proposes because a party in 

interest under 1121(c) can itself propose a 

plan. Moreover, the plan is never final until 

all appellate proceedings have -- on the 

confirmation are ended.  And so they can 

participate all the way through. 

The code contemplates that every 

executory contract must either be assumed or 

rejected.  Either way -- and I'd like to develop 

that in our conversation -- but either way, a 

party -- a counterparty is a party in interest. 

I'd be happy to -- to follow up on 

that.

 view, while -- it appears to me that they are

 interpreting "party in interest" based on some

 older Interstate Commerce Act cases that

 borrowed some Article III concepts when 

interpreting "party in interest."

 We just don't think that's a term of 

art. It's not clear to me that they actually 

say that you have to have Article III standing 

to raise an objection. I think it's more based 

on the term, and the -- the Article III ideas 

were incorporated by reference to the cases. 

So I'm not sure we disagree about 

Article III.  We just disagree about the 

interpretive method.  Our interpretive method 

just goes to the text. The text is broad.  It's 

not so broad as to get amici or, you know, 

people with very tangential views in the case. 

But, in this case, it certainly 

applies expressly to creditors, and we say -- we 

think it applies to parties with executory 

contracts because, remember, executory contracts 

under 365 are either going to be assumed 

affirmatively or rejected, and if assumed, 

sometimes they're assigned to somebody else.

contract, they have to satisfy Section 365's

 standards that protect the counterparty.  If

 there has been some kind of breach, it has to be

 cured. Certain contracts cannot be assumed. 

And the counterparty can object. Among other 

things, the counterparty has an interest in the 

debtor's ability to fulfill that contract going 

forward. And the debtor has to move to assume a

 contract.  It has to show that the business 

judgment standard has been met.  A counterparty 

can object. 

Now, if the debtor wants to reject the 

contract -- Justice Kagan, your -- your opinion 

in Mission Products Holdings addresses this --

that results in a breach of contract.  It 

results in a claim, and then the creditor is a 

claimant and not in a real good position because 

it's usually a pre-petition plain -- claim, and 

you get pennies on the dollar in most contexts. 

Either way, assumed or rejected, they 

have an interest.  Now that's reflected not only

 MR. YANG: You know, I'm not really

 unless you -- are drawing from Article III.  We

 don't really object, I think, to the outcome of

 having some direct effect.  Whether you're 

adversely affected, though, you don't -- I think 

is the wrong question. 

You have to have the potential to be 

adversely affected in a bankruptcy because 

that's what the reorganization is.  You bring 

everybody in who has a potential to be affected

interest in this until the middle of the thing?

 I mean, I can imagine many -- many events taking 

place, including there's now a plan on the table 

and now you look at the plan on the table and

 you think:  Oh, my gosh, I could be affected.

 It just seems a strange thing in a 

bankruptcy proceeding, which is fluid and has 

many twists and turns, that you would say do 

this at the outset and -- and apparently only at 

the outset. 

MR. YANG: Let me answer that, and I 

think it's easiest to answer it in the context 

of executory contracts and creditors, right? 

Executory contracts, they're always going to 

have potentially some effect.  Maybe you just, 

you know, don't know what the effect is going to 

be, and a lot of people who could be parties in 

interest, just because it doesn't fit into the 

-- it doesn't make rational economic sense, they 

don't participate, right?  They just don't 

participate until -- they have a right to, but 

they don't until it becomes relevant. 

The pre-Bankruptcy Act -- Code Act 

labels executory contractors as parties in 

interest.  Why? It's because they had to get

advance notice of rejection. And there's a case 

called King versus Baer of the Tenth Circuit,

 1973, it explains that -- you give them notice 

in a hearing so they can be heard.

 Currently, the current code says that

 the -- the counterparty can seek an order to set

 a period to assume or reject.  That's 365(d)(2).

 Other parties in interest may similarly set --

set that same period, but they can only do so in 

the context of status conferences.  That's 

105(d)(2)(A).  All of this is showing that 

parties in interest -- that -- that executory 

counter -- contract counterparties are parties 

in interest. 

Now there's a few things that I'd like 

to address.  One is there's a question about 

having a voice and not a vote. I think that 

goes to the question of being impaired. 

Impaired is what the plan under Section 1124 

proposes.  But there are other requirements for 

a plan.  For instance, a plan needs to be 

feasible. So, if you're a creditor and the plan 

proposes satisfying everything, but it satisfies 

it in a way that's not likely to end up being 

implemented -- you can object under 1129(a), I

think it's (a)(11), that the plan's not

 feasible.

 So the impairment just talks about the

 separate requirement that the classes vote.  It

 doesn't set -- address your right to be heard,

 which, by the way, is not only a right to be 

heard to object, but it's a right to be heard to

 support the plan, right?  If you're not

 impaired, you may well want to come in and 

support the plan. 

The floodgates question, it largely 

turns, I think, on the question of any issue, 

not the problem of party in interest.  Like 

take, for instance, the vending contractor that 

-- that everyone's talking about. The problem 

is not that a vending contractor gets to come in 

and be a party in interest and participate with 

respect to the vending contract, whether it's 

assumed or rejected or interpreted in a way it 

doesn't like.  The concern is that it's also 

heard on any issue. 

But the text of 1109(b) and its 

history, the evolution of expanding those groups 

that can speak on any issue, foreclose any real 

textual ability to say, oh, you can only

 participate on certain issues.  "Any issue"

 means what it says.

 Secondly, the concerns about

 floodgates, I think, are totally overstated.

 Litigants make rational economic choices where

 they have a stake in reasonable arguments.  The

 right to be heard doesn't impose on the courtan 

-- any burden to -- to speak at length if it

 doesn't think there's much to say about the 

issue. 

And the court has to decide the 

question anyway in terms of confirmation because 

this Court, in United Student Aid Funds, 

determined that the court has to decide whether 

the plan complies with the code even if no one 

objects.

 And, finally, sanctions deters any 

kind of bad-faith conduct. Ultimately, this is 

a balancing question, does it make sense to 

bring everybody in, we're going to weigh it 

against maybe some burden of having their voices 

heard, we're going to balance it against the 

waste of resources of trying to decide who gets 

to be heard, and Congress struck that choice in 

1109(b).

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Does -- does your 

position just boil down to the common-sense 

point that an insurer is on the hook for the 

claims in a mass tort bankruptcy as a party in

 interest?

 MR. YANG: I think that's a subset of 

our point, and our -- our -- our -- our primary

 point is --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, all -- all 

we need is that subset.  Don't we?  I mean, 

isn't that just kind of common -- I just thought 

that is the common-sense point. 

MR. YANG: I -- I agree.  But I 

actually don't think it's that much different 

than saying that a counterparty to an executory 

contract is always going to have an interest. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Yang? 

MR. YANG: I -- I just don't think 

that that's different.  And -- and the idea was 

that Congress --- the legislative history 

reflects that the idea here is to hear all sides 

of an issue and then let the court decide.

kind of obvious, right?  That's your point.

 Now the vending contractor might not have

 participated?  Why?  Because, you know what, it

 didn't matter.  It's like small steaks, 

potatoes. The vending contractor is just not

 going to participate. 

There's a lot of people in the 

periphery that just don't participate.  The 10

creditor is expressly a party in interest,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I'm going to

 make less?

 MR. YANG: The Court might well want

 to say more.  The Court -- but the Court 

certainly doesn't have to to resolve the issue

 with respect to whether Truck is a party in

 interest.

 Now, if the Court were wanting to 

explore the text of party in interest more, I 

think what I would suggest is that the Court can 

explain that a party is a participant on one or 

-- one of the sides of an action or an affair. 

It's not a person in interest.  It's a 

party in interest.  And context matters here. 

Bankruptcies are aggregations of individual 

controversies, and the participants there have 

an interest in the proceedings' exercise of 

jurisdiction over the debtor's property and the 

distribution. 

If the proceeding has a potential to 

affect their interests, and it's not necessarily 

an interest in the entitlement to specific 

debtor properties, if the proceeding has the 

potential to affect their interests, that is 

enough to be a party in interest.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. KEVIN MARSHALL

 FOR THE DEBTOR RESPONDENTS 

MR. MARSHALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

A party in interest is someone who has 

a legal interest in a debtor's bankruptcy 

estate, its property, not someone who is merely 

concerned about the debtor's bankruptcy more 

generally.

The list of parties in interest in

 Section 1109(b) shows this.  Settled usage of 

the term in bankruptcy confirms it. And the 

government, at least in its brief, agrees with

 it.

 At the outset of the case, the parties 

in interest will ordinarily be the debtor with 

its creditors and shareholders, those whom

 Section 1109(b) lists. 

Others, as Justice Thomas was asking 

about, may come to have an interest in the 

estate and, thus, can show that the bankruptcy 

will directly affect their rights or 

obligations.  For example, if a plan would 

breach an insurer's policy, altering its 

contract rights or obligations, then it would 

become a party in interest. 

But, if a plan preserves the insurer's 

status quo, it is insurance neutral, in that 

case, the insurer is not a party in interest and 

it has no right to object to plan confirmation. 

Here, the plan does not alter Truck's 

contract rights or obligations.  It breaches 

nothing.  It does not do anything to put Truck 

on the hook.  That is what the lower courts

uniformly found, and Truck here does not

 challenge that finding.  Truck, therefore, has 

no right to challenge plan confirmation.

 Truck invokes policy concerns that 

would supplant this settled clear rule with a

 novel expansive framework that would give 

insurers greater rights to challenge plan 

confirmation than even a creditor has. But

 bankruptcy law already addresses these concerns 

by allowing interested entities that are not 

parties in interest to pursue permissive 

intervention.  Truck simply ignores that tool. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Marshall, the --

at the beginning, at the outset of these 

proceedings, bankruptcy proceedings, Truck was a 

creditor and Truck certainly from its vantage 

point was a party in interest because of the --

being the one insurer for all of the claims --

many of the claims here. 

So do you think we should look at the 

filing period as the point to -- to determine 

party of interest, or should we do it at a later 

point? 

It would seem that you can't do

 MR. MARSHALL:  If one is in the list 

of entities in Section 1109(b), it's possible to 

answer that question at the outset.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So they would be a

 creditor?

 MR. MARSHALL:  They were -- they were 

a creditor, yes, but as to their status as an 

insurer, the question is, do they have an 

interest in the debtor's bankruptcy estate?  And 

at the outset of the case, it was obviously a 

no, but then, when a plan is submitted and they 

want to claim that that would breach their 

policy rights and give them interest in the 

estate, then that would be the point at which --

MR. MARSHALL:  -- the threshold 

question would need to be decided. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let me -- let's

As a creditor, at the beginning, if 

they are considered a party in interest, can 

they raise any issue in the proceedings?

generally can. In the context of a plan 

confirmation, if they're unimpaired, they don't 

have the right to object.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Isn't it just

 common sense that an insurer at the outset is

 going to have an interest in this because how

 much the insurer will have to pay will be 

affected by how the plan is structured? 

MR. MARSHALL:  Justice Kavanaugh, they 

could be interested in the general sense of 

being concerned, which was the phrase Truck 

tended to use. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No, not just 

concerned but how much they owe -- how much 

they're going to have to pay.  It's not just I'm 

concerned about things.  How much I'm going to 

have to pay. 

MR. MARSHALL:  And so then the 

question is, at what point do they come to have 

an interest in the estate? And if a plan is 

proposed that would -- that in their view would 

breach their policy, they certainly have the 

right to be heard on whether it would, in fact, 

breach their policy rights, and they were heard 

here.

And the courts, all the courts, all 

three lower courts held their policy rights were

 not breached.  And so there's nothing about the

 bankruptcy case that puts the insurer on the

 hook. That can happen in cases. It happened in 

a Ninth Circuit case that's in the briefs.

 And if -- if the plan actually --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But -- you're 

saying put them on the hook, but for how much 

they're going to be on the hook, that will be 

affected, right? 

MR. MARSHALL:  I'm not sure I followed 

that. The -- the -- nothing about the 

bankruptcy case changes Truck's position.  If 

the bankruptcy case were to -- to change an 

insurer's position, it would be a party in 

interest and have a right to object to the plan.

a party in interest, then they would have the 

right to come in and raise the issues of 

concern, including the fraud prevention

 measures.

 But it's a threshold question.

 Perhaps it's helpful to think of an analogy.  A

 creditor, as we were discussing with Justice

 Thomas, has a right to raise any issue under 

1109(b), but there's a threshold question 

whether you actually are a creditor. So you can 

come in and you can say you're a creditor.  You 

don't actually have to move to intervene.  And a 

court -- if somebody challenges that, then the 

court has to decide, are you a creditor or not? 

That's --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I stop you a 

moment? I am looking at the brief of amici 

American Prosperity Casualty Insurance, and on 

page 15, they explain that once the plan is

 approved, this plan, under your terms, it

 obtains a discharge, the Debtor, and the 

protection of a channeling injunction, now all 

the claims are going to go through the trust and 

not to you. 

The Debtor has no ongoing incentive 

after the plan is approved to limit the cost of 

defending, paying claims, and any liability on 

those claims.  You lose it.  That's the benefit 

bankruptcy gives -- giving you.  And the 

Claimants, their incentive for this plan is that 

they don't want the anti-fraud provisions. 

So who's protecting the insured?  If

itself because you say it can't go to the 

bankruptcy court, how is it being heard?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I can argue that 

the plan is breached, and once they say the 

plan's not reached -- breached, I can't argue 

that the plan violates the code? I -- I've just 

never heard of --

MR. MARSHALL:  If --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- parsing 

standing in that way. 

MR. MARSHALL:  Justice Sotomayor, if 

one is not a party in interest, there's no right 

to raise issues.  Party-in-interest status is a 

threshold question. 

And, here, as to Truck as an insurer, 

they need to show they have an interest in the 

bankruptcy estate to get in, to answer the 

threshold question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they do.

MR. MARSHALL:  And -- and to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess the

 question --

MR. MARSHALL:  -- to do that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Mr. Marshall, is I 

think what everybody is saying to you is, well, 

they do have an interest in these anti-fraud

 provisions.  Not just a concern, they have an

 interest, a material interest.  If they get the 

anti-fraud provisions, they're better off. If 

they don't get the anti-fraud provisions, 

they're worse off. 

Now what I hear you saying back is 

they had no preexisting entitlement to the 

anti-fraud provisions, and your test is one that 

says, if they're not being made worse off by the 

plan, then they're not an interested party. 

But I -- I don't know why that should 

be the test. If I look at the language, that's 

not the test.  If I think about what the 

ordinary meaning of being a party who's 

interested is, that's not the test. 

Why -- why is your test so long as 

they're not being made worse off, they're not an 

interested party?

MR. MARSHALL:  Well, the -- the test

 of whether I -- there is a benefit I would like 

to get out of the bankruptcy case, which is

 Truck's test, is unlimited.  Anytime you can

 imagine a hypothetical plan that would be better

 off for you --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, okay.  Well, 

that's a practical concern.

 MR. MARSHALL:  Well, it -- it --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I think, you know, 

the practical argument against it is it's pretty 

costly to enter into these proceedings, and 

nobody really does it unless they have a serious 

interest, and, anyway, bankruptcy courts have 

docket management techniques. 

And, anyway, just putting aside the 

practical concerns, is this a floodgates problem 

or is it not a floodgates problem, I don't 

really see why your test, which is are you being 

made worse off or are you being made -- or -- or 

is it -- you know, are you just being held to 

the bargain that you initially had, I don't see 

why anybody would think that that's the way to 

answer a question of whether you're interested 

in a proceeding.

MR. MARSHALL:  "Party in interest" is 

a term of art that means you have an interest in 

the debtor's bankruptcy estate. That's been the

 meaning for a hundred years.  And so that's the

 way to start.

 But, if we're going to think in terms 

of seeking to obtain a benefit, in the context 

of causes of action, Lexmark zone of interests, 

the question is always, have you suffered a 

loss? If you've suffered a loss, you come in 

and you try to get a remedy. 

What Truck is saying here is, I can 

come in, even though I'm suffering no loss at 

all to my legal rights, and just seek to obtain 

a benefit because it's very nice that this 

bankruptcy is here and maybe I can get something 

out of it. 

But even if they don't have the right 

to come in, there's always permissive 

intervention.  So there's the right to -- to 

come in as an interested entity that's not a 

party in interest.  The benefit of that is it's 

in the discretion of the bankruptcy court.  You 

have to show cause.  The bankruptcy court can 

decide whether you come in for all issues or

be collusive?  Everybody said below that they 

had an interest in the plan finding.

 MR. MARSHALL:  The plan finding was a

 threshold question that they certainly had the

 right to litigate.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.  And they did 

have an interest as a creditor because of the

 deductibles that were due, right?

 MR. MARSHALL:  They were a creditor. 

As to the plan at issue here, they were 

unimpaired --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  But --

MR. MARSHALL:  -- and didn't have the 

right to object. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- that's looking 

ahead to the plan.  I guess what I want to say 

is that 1109(b) says that "a party in interest," 

including our list, "may be heard on any issue" 

in a case under this chapter.  So, if they can 

be heard on the plan finding or if they're a 

creditor, I guess I don't understand why, on the 

text of that provision, they can be so limited 

and say, well, you can't bring up anything else, 

even though the -- the text says "any issue." 

It doesn't limit it in that way.

MR. MARSHALL:  I'll address that in --

in two respects.  So the plan finding, again, is 

the question of whether they are a party in

 interest in the first place.  It's a threshold

 question.  It's like deciding jurisdiction or

 statutory standing.  And you have to get through 

that to get to the merits.

 So, as an insurer, nothing about the 

plan finding changes whether or not Truck is a 

party in interest.  They're not. As to a 

creditor, we're talking about the right to

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, Mr. Marshall, 

maybe I'm not understanding about the plan

the court said that Truck wasn't harmed.  But, 

you know, what if the -- what if the court had 

decided otherwise?  In the beginning, they don't 

know whether it's going to be collusive or 

violate Kaiser's duty of good faith, right? 

Maybe I'm just misunderstanding.  I

 right to come in and litigate whether you're a

MR. MARSHALL:  Borrowing from 

intervention law, the question would be when is

 their interest put at issue.  And it's -- it's

 somewhat like the -- which would be is a plan 

proposed that would breach your contract and 

give you an interest in the estate. And it's 

analogous to what the actual history is with

 executory contracts.

 So the -- the -- the -- the -- the 

statutory history that the government invokes 

actually says -- suggests you're a party in 

interest when there is a motion to reject an 

executory contract because that would create a 

claim, a breach, and make you a creditor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess I don't 

understand your answer, and I --

MR. MARSHALL:  So when -- when it's 

put at issue.

why isn't it put --

people who are not potentially affected are not 

parties in interest, I guess I don't understand 

Congress's suggestion that parties in interest 

should be a part of the reorganization.

 In other words, the context in which

 their -- what -- what's valuable to them about

 being a party in interest is the fact that they 

then get to talk with everybody about how this 

is going to go. 

And the problem I'm having with your 

argument is it suggests that it's only after we 

know or after they know that they're definitely 

affected that they get a -- a seat at the table, 

but the whole point of it is that the parties in 

interest get to talk about it. 

So it seems to me it would have to 

include people who have a clear potential for 

being affected by the plan that we're all 

hammering out in this discussion. 

MR. MARSHALL:  There's nothing in 

1109(b) itself that says that has to be 

determined once and for all at the outset.  And 

if we're talking about someone who's not in the 

list, the only way to know if you're a party in 

interest is do you have an interest in the

 ORAL ARGUMENT DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE CLAIMANT RESPONDENTS

 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

There are a number of questions I'd 

like to address that you posed this morning, but 

I want to start with one principle, which is 

that the Bankruptcy Code was not intended to 

protect insurers, except in a couple of places 

where asbestos-related trusts are created, those 

are in Section 524(g) principally, but in 109, 

Congress said an insurer can't invoke bankruptcy 

for protections under the code. 

So, Justice Kavanaugh, to your 

question about the text and practicalities, 

Congress answered the question of whether an 

insurer should be permitted to butt into a 

debtor's bankruptcy and try to use it to protect 

its own financial interests.  The bankruptcy 

process is designed to ensure that the debtor

can maximize its assets for the benefit of

 creditors.

 And so what the insurer as insurer is

 doing here is seeking to co-opt the debtor's 

bankruptcy for the purpose of protecting its own

 interests.

 Justice Thomas, I can start with the

 timing question if you like.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let -- well, 

you can start with that, but also I think that 

the -- their interest isn't so much in 

feathering their own nest per se but, rather, 

that they be treated with the anti-fraud 

provisions the same way that the claims under 

the trust are being treated. 

MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  And let me start 

with -- the -- the -- I'm going to call these 

pretrial disclosure requirements because Truck 

had six months of discovery to try to prove any 

fraud with the Kaiser claimants and came up with 

crickets. 

What they are calling anti-fraud 

prevention measures are really requirements to

what Truck wants for information that a state

 court might or might not require under state

 court rules of procedure.

 So, if you were to accept the idea 

that their nomenclature drives the outcome here, 

you're essentially saying bankruptcy courts have

 the authority to tell state courts how to do

 their discovery process.

           And, Justice Barrett, that's why we're 

fighting this, because the claimants shouldn't 

be required to impose on themselves and their 

families a lot of information that if Truck 

really wanted it, it could ask for it in state 

court discovery proceedings and state court 

judges could decide --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Frederick --

burdensome or not. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- why do all 

these other circuits and other bankruptcy courts 

impose it? If they felt the same way that 

you're arguing, are they violating the 

Bankruptcy Code by -- or -- or disrespecting 

state courts because that's what they require?

here are only for a very small class of claims

 that are called extraordinary claims.  And they

 are extraordinary claims, it's defined at JA 

427, under the plan. These are not insured 

claims where the claimant is seeking to say that 

Kaiser was responsible for the vast bulk of its

 exposure to asbestos.

 And in that very unusual circumstance,

 which actually in the implementation of this 

plan hasn't arisen yet, the requirement is for 

that claimant to come forward with proof of a 

negative, that it hadn't been exposed to 

asbestos by any other potential tortfeasor.  And 

so we're talking about a very narrow class with 

a description for a very particularized purpose 

that Truck wants to appropriate and force so 

that claimants will have less of an opportunity 

to invoke their jury trial rights in state 

court, which are protected under the U.S. Code. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why -- why 

should you as the debtor trust have that 

advantage and not give it to them?

 MR. FREDERICK:  It's not for this

 reason.  The -- the treatment by Kaiser of Truck 

is exactly the same before bankruptcy as it was

 now. Truck agreed contractually --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But bankruptcy 

changes everyone. It changes who the debtor is

 to the trust.  It -- by its own terms, it's

 extinguishing the debtor's obligation --

obligations to anyone, except under the extant 

contract, but the incentives are different. 

There is inherent change. 

MR. FREDERICK:  That's why the 

principle of insurance neutrality, which was 

developed 30 years ago in the courts of appeals 

and has actually followed in every single court 

of appeals that has addressed this question, has 

looked at whether the insurers' legal 

obligations are altered, and if they are not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're still --

then circle back to my initial question.  Other 

bankruptcy courts have imposed these same 

requirements and they've done it.  Are they 

breaching bankruptcy law?  Are they stepping on 

state courts in an improper way? What are they

 MR. FREDERICK:  The cases that we cite 

historically under the Transportation Act of 

1920 make very clear that if you're just seeking 

a benefit, you don't get party-in-interest

 status.  You have to show aggrievement and harm 

to your pre-position. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So those are some 

1920s cases.  Do you have anything in the text 

that can suggest that the text has incorporated 

that view? 

MR. FREDERICK:  We don't have anything 

like that, although I would point to the history 

that the Debtors' brief very helpfully lays out, 

which explains how the original -- origination 

of the Bankruptcy Code went through these 

iterations and accepted those principles for 

party in interest.

other side is essentially saying Article III has

 And so those claims are going to be 

somewhat flowing in and out.  And it is

 imperative in the 524(g) context that you

 recognize Article III has a role to play.  Why? 

Because the district court has to enter the

have the authority to do that under the statute.

 MR. FREDERICK:  But the point of 

voting is who can hear, and the whole point of 

the chart which you can see the bankruptcy 

court's determination, is who's impaired or not 

because the bankruptcy court has to get to an 

end place. There were a dozen insurers here,

 and under their position, there is no limiting

 principle to any of those insurers who could 

continue to fight because they want to get 

benefits out of a bankruptcy process that 

Congress foreclosed to them. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do you agree on 

Article III that -- that that's with respect to 

a plaintiff coming to court and not with respect 

to those who object under Bond and Clapper? 

MR. FREDERICK:  No, I don't agree with 

that. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: You disagree with 

Bond and Clapper on that? 

MR. FREDERICK:  I think that -- I 

think Clapper is actually more helpful for our 

side, Justice --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What about Bond?

point is where the effort by the objector in

 this situation is seeking to get a benefit and

 must show under Article III that it has injury 

in fact that is redressable and traceable to the

 plan.

           Here, Truck can't satisfy either 

because its redressability problem is really 

because they think state courts are not going to 

be adequate to police fraud, and they don't --

they are not able to trace their harm as insurer 

to the plan because of the insurance neutrality 

provision. 

And so I think there's a very serious 

Article III question here that Truck has 

essentially glided by in this argument this 

morning, but I want to urge you to take that 

very seriously because it can't be the case that 

we have, like, a law school seminar or anybody 

who wants to come and talk gets to talk.  The 

whole point of a bankruptcy proceeding is get to 

a confirmed plan, and the only way to do that is 

to weed out the people who have something that 

they want to say and to have different threshold 

provisions.

back to your timing question. At the disclosure

 statement, the -- the -- the debtor has to

 present a plan.  That is where the issues of 

insurance neutrality typically are going to be

 addressed.  And at confirmation, we are knowing

 then that the creditor is impaired or not

 impaired.

 So those are the two key timing

 mechanisms.  It can't be at the outset of a 

bankruptcy because there isn't enough known 

about the nature of the estate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if he's 

not impaired, doesn't he have an interest in 

making sure that doesn't change? 

MR. FREDERICK:  He does, but that's 

where the confirmation of the plan comes in. 

And that's why, if you look at the chart, Mr. 

Chief Justice, there's a -- this group is 

unimpaired, this group is unimpaired because 

they are paid in full. 

And Truck was paid in full for its 

premiums.  So it is not an executory contract, 

which, under the Vern Countryman definition, was 

where there was -- lack of performance on both 

sides of the contract.  Here, the Debtor

 performed on the contract.  The Debtor paid all

 the premiums. 

And so it is a non-executory contract,

 which I think helps give the lie to the 

government's position that calling something an

 executory contract is somehow going to solve the

 problem here, where you've got performance that

 is occurring at different levels and at

 different stages. 

And that's why the DOJ policy manual 

itself says be very careful about invoking 

executory contracts because they're not defined 

in the bankruptcy code and it's very difficult 

to know how to administer them in practice. 

And so for the government to be 

suggesting that you have a test here that is so 

malleable, where the interests of claimants and 

creditors is critically important to 

understanding how to weed out the various 

muckrakers, where the United -- and I would 

point you to the policyholders' brief, pages 12 

to 14, which talks about just how long the 

insurers have an interest.  Why? Delay is 

profit-maximizing.  Every day insurers do not 

have to pay on their claims is a good day for

 MR. FREDERICK:  I'm saying that

 impairment is treated differently.  So you can

 be a creditor --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah.

 MR. FREDERICK:  -- and a party in

 interest, but you are not allowed then to vote

than a creditor.

I mean, the law does that all the

may be the majority or a significant part of it

MR. FREDERICK:  And -- and that's why 

I think looking to the guidance of the courts of 

appeals is actually humbling at one level but

 also instructive.

 For 30 years, courts of appeals have

 looked at this idea of insurance neutrality to

 determine whether a plan is materially altering

 preexisting legal obligations.

 In those cases where the court has 

said yes, it is, insurance companies are allowed 

to be parties in interest.  That's the Thorpe 

case out of the Ninth Circuit, the Global case 

out of the Third Circuit. 

But, in those situations where there's 

an insurance neutrality provision and the 

insurance company is not able to say with any 

proof that its legal obligations are materially 

altered, the courts of appeals have said: 

You're not a party in interest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn't 

Truck want to have something to say about the --

the division that you've just cited? 

MR. FREDERICK:  And they do, Mr. Chief

 insurance company's legal obligations, are they 

impaired or not? And that fight is a very

 vigorous fight in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but

 it's -- it -- that fight continues beyond what

 you're calling the threshold.

 MR. FREDERICK:  It -- it -- it does 

and it is. But, at a point where the plan is 

confirmed and we know there will be insurance 

neutrality, and we know that their rights as a 

creditor are not giving them a right to vote, at 

that point, it should stop and the four years 

that we spent doing appellate litigation here 

ought not to be necessary.

when an insurer faces millions of dollars in

 financial liability, like Petitioner does here, 

common sense and fundamental bankruptcy policy 

dictate that it be considered a party in

 interest in the bankruptcy proceeding."

 So you can just -- I mean, this is

 repeating what you've said probably, but that

 sounds different from muckrakers.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, what I would 

say, Justice Kavanaugh, is that a party in 

interest has extraordinary rights.  They have 

the right to contest the trustee, the 

appointment, the powers of the trustee.  They 

can object to the lifting of the automatic stay. 

They can ask for the elimination of a plan. 

They can ask for the transformation of it from a 

Chapter 11 to a Chapter 7. 

And those powers are -- are -- are and 

rights are very powerful and they take 

bankruptcy courts an enormous amount of time to 

thoughtfully and conscientiously work their way 

through. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Three points.  Two quick and one a little bit 

longer. 

One, just to really underscore 

1126(f), that is about voting.  That is not 

about what 1109(b) about, which is being heard, 

two very different things. 

Number two, on intervention, Congress 

did away with the requirement that parties in 

interest must intervene when it replaced 206 and 

207 with 1109(b). 

And three, my -- my friends have 

talked a lot about the insurer in this case 

trying to get something out of the bankruptcy or 

seek a benefit.

 inflated claims is not seeking a benefit.  It's 

just trying to make sure that the plan complies 

with the code as bankruptcy judges have an 

independent duty to ensure.

 And even if you disagree with me on

 that, it's -- it's undisputed that Truck is 

going to pay the vast bulk of claims in this 

case, that the plan finding adjudicates Truck's 

insurance rights, that Truck is a creditor 

because the insurance deductible, so it really 

is a party in interest several times over.  And 

I haven't heard from my friends on the other 

side any justification for reading any issues 

out of the text. 

1109(b) gives stakeholders a voice, 

not a vote and certainly not a veto.  We would 

respectfully ask the Court to reverse and 

remand.
