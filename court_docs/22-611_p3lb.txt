 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 22-611, Lindke versus

 Freed.

 Mr. Kedem.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KEDEM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The dialogue between public officials 

and their constituents is fundamental to our 

democracy.  Much of that conversation now takes 

place online, with social media platforms 

serving as the new town square, where public 

officials provide important information about 

what they're doing on the public's behalf and 

soliciting comments in return.  While public 

officials retain First Amendment rights, use of 

a private social media account does not immunize 

an official's conduct from First Amendment or 

constitutional scrutiny. 

Under our test for state action, a 

public official who creates a channel for 

communicating with constituents about in-office

conduct and then blocks a user from that channel

 must abide by the Constitution.  This test, 

which focuses on how the public official is

 using and purporting to use that account, is

 consistent with this Court's precedent under 

which a public official who purports to act in 

that capacity is a state actor. It also accords

 with Section 1983 and the original understanding 

of what it means to act under color of law. 

The Sixth Circuit's duty and authority 

test, by contrast, would provide ready means for 

public officials to evade the Constitution. 

Here, for instance, it would mean that the city 

manager would be free to block from his Facebook 

page any constituent who is a member of a 

disfavored race, religion, or political group, 

free from constitutional constraint. 

Our test avoids that result while 

still leaving ample room for public officials to 

communicate in their personal capacities. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Would you also win 

under the doing your -- doing their jobs test? 

MR. KEDEM: Yes, we absolutely would, 

in part because, as has been pointed out, part

of the job of any high-ranking executive

 official -- and the city manager is essentially 

just under the mayor in terms of being high up

 in city government -- part of that job is

 telling people about what you're doing.

 And what Mr. Freed was doing with his 

Facebook account, sometimes multiple times a 

day, was informing the citizens about what he, 

as city manager, in his role as city manager, 

was doing for the town and then communicating 

directly with constituents about that, sometimes 

answering their questions about the scope of his 

orders. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But Ms. Karlan made 

the point that there were only three instances 

on the website there in the last case that were 

personal.  In this case, just going through the 

Joint Appendix, there's quite a bit that is 

personal. 

So how would you just -- just 

factually distinguish that or emphasize the fact 

-- the fact that --

MR. KEDEM: Sure. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- the personal here 

does not override the official?

MR. KEDEM: So there were certainly a 

lot more personal posts, although the ratio of

 job-related posts to personal posts changed

 dramatically at the start of the pandemic, as

 you would expect, because a lot of the services 

and the way that he was doing his job migrated

 online.

 I think, once you've established a

 channel for communicating with constituents 

about your job, I don't think also posting 

sometimes about your family is going to undo 

that, although, if what you're complaining about 

in a specific case is being -- is having a 

comment on a personal post deleted, obviously, 

that would change the equation. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Does it matter if 

you've established this channel ahead of time 

and before you became a public official?  I 

mean, you sort of suggested that it had to do 

with the purpose of the --

MR. KEDEM: Yeah. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- account. 

MR. KEDEM: So I -- I think you would 

look at what you were doing with the page 

beforehand or you could, I suppose, but I think

it's fairly clear that Mr. Freed wasn't talking

 about the job of the city manager before he

 actually became city manager.  He wasn't posting

 about directives that he himself issued until --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, but I guess

 MR. KEDEM: -- he had that power.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I'm asking, does

 it matter whether or not he opens up a new page 

once he becomes the city manager and begins 

conversing in the way that --

MR. KEDEM: Yeah. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- we're talking 

about, or, alternatively, he had this page 

before he became city manager, it had all of his 

personal information and, you know, pictures of 

his kids and whatnot, and he just added to the 

stream of conversation? 

MR. KEDEM: So I -- I think that's 

something that you would look at.  Obviously, it 

would be a factor.  But there were a lot of 

things that changed when he became city manager, 

not just the content of the posts, but, 

presumably, he also didn't list as his website 

on the -- the page this official city address.

He didn't use the community comments at

 PortHuron.org as his email address.  There were 

a number of things that changed by virtue of the 

fact that he was starting to use this in his

 capacity as the -- the city manager of the town.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Would it have

 mattered to you if he had a disclaimer on it?

 MR. KEDEM: So I think it probably 

wouldn't get you back over the line into 

personal use, in part because of the way that he 

was using it to make certain announcements and 

issue directives, information that you wouldn't 

necessarily be able to get anywhere else.  And, 

certainly, there was no other place that you 

could go to interact with the city manager. 

Now it would have, I think, been 

something that they could argue that he was 

doing -- using this in a personal capacity, but 

I think the disclaimer would have been 

substantially overridden by the way he was 

actually using the page. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Just to be clear, if 

the page had not been created until he became 

city manager, would the case come out the same 

way? Should it come out the same way in your

perhaps it would be even clearer than it already

 is.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It would be -- okay. 

What if 95 percent of the posts are personal and 

5 percent of the posts involve discussion of his

 work?

           MR. KEDEM: So it would obviously be a 

more difficult argument for us to make, but I 

would still be here certainly as my client's 

attorney telling you, look, if there's only one 

place to go to interact with the city manager 

about issues -- directives that he himself had 

issued, the fact that he posts a lot about cats 

or whatever personal thing he wants to post 

about, that doesn't change the fact that if you 

get blocked off from that page, you're suddenly 

losing access to a lot of information. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if it's entirely 

personal, but once he slips and he talks about 

his work, that -- that changes it? 

MR. KEDEM: I think it does because, 

there, it's not really being established as a 

channel of communication.  It's a little bit

like running into someone at the grocery store,

 where maybe they let slip some information about

 the way the government is working.  That doesn't 

mean that they are going to the grocery store in

 order to interact with constituents.

 But you could, obviously, change the

office hours every Friday in the grocery store 

for an hour to talk with citizens about, you 

know, pending legislation and what I'm intending 

to do. It --

drawing. You said, if it's 5 percent official, 

5 percent work-related, then it's state action, 

but if it's like 1 percent, one-half of 

1 percent, it's not?  Is that what you're 

saying? 

MR. KEDEM: So it -- it's not a 

quantitative test.  It's qualitative.  But the 

quality that you're going for is whether you've 

established it as a channel of communication. 

And I thought I understood your hypothetical as 

essentially just one thing you said one time,

you're using this as an ongoing channel of

 communicating --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel --

MR. KEDEM: -- with constituents.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I'm confused.

 Is -- is it the channel that we're supposed to

 be focusing on -- this gets back to the Chief

 Justice's first question in the last argument --

or is it the message at issue itself? 

Because I had thought I heard you say, 

if the message were about a private family 

matter and you were blocked from that, you 

wouldn't have any recourse.  So which is it?  Is 

it the channel, or is it the message? 

MR. KEDEM: So I think, in part, it 

depends on what function you're complaining 

about. If your complaint is you're being 

blocked from access to the page, then it's the 

channel that matters.  It's the entire page and 

your access to information. 

If, on the other hand, you're 

complaining because your comment was deleted 

from a post, it obviously matters what the post 

was about.  If it was a post about cats, then 

you don't have any constitutional claim.

 that, but I think that's what the distinction 

between talking about your job, which you might 

do at the grocery store, and establishing a

happens on an ongoing basis.

 MR. KEDEM: -- I think -- I think, 

there, if you were just issuing an invitation to

 your friends, that's very different than issuing

 a general invitation to everyone in the town,

 all your constituents who you basically say, I

 will interact with anyone who comes, but,

 according to my friends from the other side, you 

could essentially say, but only the white 

citizens of the town are invited. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  But it 

goes back to who you want to include and who you 

want to exclude, I guess.  And I think elected 

officials and appointed officials rely on groups 

of people who are supporters, friends, people 

they've known, people that are fair-minded, not 

people that are just going to come and scream at 

them --

MR. KEDEM: Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- to get advice, 

thoughts, including negative and critical 

thoughts, but they want to exclude, you know, 

the person who's the jerk who's going to 

interrupt the whole thing.

sort of on the extremes where either you're just

 inviting an old friend or you're inviting 

everyone in the town because they're 

constituents, which is essentially what Freed

 was doing.

 In the middle, I grant you there will 

be difficult cases where it sort of seems like

 you are inviting everyone only that you like, 

or, you know, there may be other ways to divide 

the hypothetical. 

But I think, in a case like Facebook, 

where, essentially, anyone with a profile 

could -- could look at Mr. Freed's page, I think 

it's -- it's relatively clear the invitation was 

to everyone in the town. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I direct your 

attention to what I perceive to be a difference 

between your position and the one that Ms. 

Karlan just articulated?  And maybe there is no 

daylight, but I would -- be helpful to 

understand if there is. 

You've said repeatedly here that this 

is about whether or not the page has been 

established as a channel of communication, which 

sounds to me like a species of the appearance.

 We're looking at this page and we're seeing how

 it operates.

 I understood Ms. Karlan to be saying: 

Well, really, her test is, are you doing your

 job? What are the duties and functions of your 

position? And have you created this page and

 does it operate to facilitate your job duties?

 Are you at all -- so is there a

 difference between those two?  And are you also 

relying at all on the sort of duties or 

functions the -- whether or not the person had 

to create the page or something like this? 

MR. KEDEM: So I think, if they had to 

create the page, that obviously is game over. 

But we agree with the Respondents in the prior 

case that there has to be a broader conception 

of what duty encompasses to mean everything that 

is sort of customarily expected of you in your 

job for a high-ranking executive official. 

Usually, that's going to be talking about your 

job at least in certain established ways. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I didn't hear 

your test to be about duty at all really. 

MR. KEDEM: Yeah.  So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is it?

MR. KEDEM: So I think the answer is

 it is certainly sufficient if you have a concept

 of doing your job through your page.  We think 

that we have that here.

 We also have a slightly broader

 principle that if you hold yourself out as doing 

your job through your page, that is also 

sufficient, which I don't know that my friends 

on the other side -- on -- Respondent in the 

first -- first case disagrees with, but they 

aren't relying as much on that principle. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And your hold 

yourself out in the situation is because we can 

look at the page and we see that it has been 

established as a channel for communication with 

the constituents? 

MR. KEDEM: Yeah.  So it's partly the 

way that you design your page and partly what 

you do with it.  Here, we have both his profile 

and the way that he was posting and what he was 

posting about. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I would have 

thought that the "what it looks like" is the 

worst test for you, because what this looks like 

is there are a lot of baby pictures and dog

 And intermixed with that, there is, as 

you say, communication with constituents about

 important matters.  But it's hard to look at

 this page as a whole, unlike the one in the last

 case, and not think that surely this could not

 be the official communication channel.

MR. KEDEM: Right.  Well, I think 

small-town government works in different ways. 

Obviously, there was some personal stuff as 

well. But the way that he was talking about the 

posts, referring to things in the plural, the 

way that he was posting things that were 

directives that he himself had issued only 

minutes earlier and then answering constituent 

questions about that, now, admittedly, he was 

also talking about personal things, but you 

can't essentially immunize yourself from 

constitutional scrutiny if you've established

And if -- if it is within the scope of

define that very, very broadly, you give the

what many millions of Americans can say.  And, 

surely, that must -- must be some concern to

and there's some irony on the other side to say 

the way to solve the First Amendment problem is 

to turn it all into government speech, so the 

government controls what millions of civil

 servants in -- in towns large, small, and the 

federal government alike, what they can and 

cannot say in the public forum.

 MR. KEDEM: So, admittedly, there is 

going to be some issue of government control, 

but I don't think that's escapable.  For 

instance, if the mayor of Port Huron had wanted 

to, she obviously could have told Mr. Freed 

either stop posting your directives to your 

personal page, or, when you post them, also post 

this additional information, or, when you answer 

a question about this directive, answer it in 

this way. 

So that sort of control is already 

going to be there regardless of whether he's 

considered a state actor. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It would be on -- on 

a clearly public page.

your question alludes to, there is a doctrine 

under the First Amendment that reconciles the 

First Amendment rights of a public official 

against the government's interests in the 

speech. 

One of the key points that we're 

making is the exact same factors that you look 

to to decide whether the government has an 

interest in the speech and therefore has some 

control over it, even when it's ostensibly 

private speech, those are things like, are you

going to use your title on your page, as many 

people do, just make clear you're saying this in

 your private capacity?

 And if the government can say that to 

you consistent with the First Amendment, then 

you sort of understand that there's not going to 

be a different First Amendment equation just 

because we're calling it state action as well. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, 

these -- on these pages, people -- people have 

both a job in the government and they have all 

sorts of other things, whether it's cats or 

children or whatever it is, and the problem it 

seems to me is we kind of have to disaggregate 

that, right, and say, well, you know, you have 

to have a governmental page and you have to have 

a private page and you can't mention the 

government on your private page or else it's 

going to become a government page. 

And as I understand it, you basically 

say, if you've got 5 percent government, then 

we, the government, can basically say the whole 

thing, even if the rest of it is all about your

say you can't put pictures of little dogs on

 And it seems to me that -- that that 

effort to kind of disentangle the two things 

doesn't really reflect the reality of how social

 media works.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: About the dogs

MR. KEDEM: A little bit about the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

MR. KEDEM: So one principle is it's 

not the 5 percent versus 95 percent, that you've 

gotten over some threshold.  It's the way you're 

using your page as an ongoing place where people 

in the town go to get information about what you 

as a city manager are doing, how you're doing 

your job, the directives that you issue. 

If you set it up that way, that's the

MR. KEDEM: Sure.  So I think, as soon 

as the pandemic started, there were multiple 

posts a day about what he and other people in 

the government were doing.  Usually, he was 

going to post a daily COVID update from the, 

basically, health equivalent of the CDC.  He was 

posting directives.  So I could direct you, for 

instance, to the directive on page 22 of the 

Joint Appendix.  There's another directive on 

page 20 of the Joint Appendix. And then the 

specific post that was the subject of the 

dispute with my client, that was flanked by a 

post about a community operations outreach 

center on one side and a place to donate for

people who were struggling on the other side.

 So there were just multiple posts a

 day about this.  And he was also interacting 

with constituents. So one of the key features, 

I think, that you would lose out on is, if you 

go back to page 22 of the Joint Appendix, he 

issues this order about cutting off water, and 

he says basically effective immediately we're 

not going to cut off water for 30 days because 

of the pandemic.  And then there's a question 

from a constituent below who says, well, what 

about people whose water is already cut off? 

Are those going to be turned back on? And he 

answers yes. 

So there is essentially a real-time 

gloss on his own directive.  And it's possible 

that the directive appeared somewhere else. 

There's nothing in the record about that.  But 

it presumably came a little bit later, and if 

you wanted to know what is the city manager, 

who's essentially the chief executive officer 

for the town, what is he doing, that's the place 

to go. There was essentially no other game in 

town for figuring it out if you were a citizen 

of Port Huron.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, that makes it 

pretty difficult for a public official or a city 

manager to have any kind of private site because

 he could have a private Facebook page populated 

with pictures of his dog, pictures of his kids, 

and one of his friends asks something about the 

water shutoff, and he says, you know, yeah, the 

water is going to be shut off, you know, et 

cetera, or a storm's coming, whatever. 

Has he then transformed what he 

thought was his private Facebook page into 

something that is state action and so he 

arguably has to give everybody in the town 

access to, when he might not want to give them, 

you know, access to pictures of his kids?  Or 

does he have to tell his friend, sorry, I can't 

answer that question here, head over to my 

public Facebook page and I'll answer it there? 

MR. KEDEM: So that sounds a lot to me 

like the sort of Facebook equivalent of just 

running into someone in the grocery store.  I 

don't think that that creates any sort of 

channel that way, although the best practice is 

obviously to refer someone -- you know, for more 

information, go to the official page.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  It creates

 nightmares of litigation, though, right?

 MR. KEDEM: So it -- it could create

 nightmares of litigation.  I think, literally, 

whatever you say here, unless you essentially 

say nothing that happens over Facebook is going 

to ever be state action, which I don't even now 

take any of the -- the parties to be arguing, 

unless you say that, you're always going to have 

some amount of litigation. 

The good news is our test has been the 

majority test in the circuits.  And I think the 

reason that you don't see a flood of litigation, 

there are basically only five court of appeals 

decisions, including the two cases before you, 

is number one.  You've got the qualified 

immunity overlay, number two.  Most of these 

First Amendment claims are -- are not going to 

have much to them.  They can be dismissed on 

reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.

MR. KEDEM: Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: -- of some kind? 

And we can debate what official notice is.

 MR. KEDEM: So I think Facebook, as 

this Court has said in other cases, and all of

 these social media -- media platforms are 

incredibly powerful in a way that running into 

someone in the grocery store is not. This is 

not just an incidental place where you happen to 

receive speech from someone. 

You know, in the olden days, if you 

were a public official and you wanted to 

communicate with the public outside of formal 

channels, you probably would have had to walk 

out of your office, maybe find a pay phone, if 

you remember what those still were, and it would 

have been very difficult without the use of your 

staff to communicate to the public in any sort 

of broad way. 

These social media platforms make that 

basically instantaneous.  You can cast as wide a 

net as you want, talk to everyone in the town. 

You can talk specifically to individual people. 

They are just incredibly powerful in a way that 

I don't think that just the happenstance of

running into someone in the grocery store is.

 I think the better analogy, if I may

 tweak yours, is essentially just saying, you

 know, I'm going to post my private phone number.

 Everyone in the town can give me a call if you

 have problems with your leaf collection.  Oh, 

but, by the way, only white citizens are allowed

 to use this phone.  I think that would also be

 constitutionally problematic, even though you 

were using your own private phone number.

 channel of communication because we have some 

posts that give the kind of information and ask 

for public feedback, but you also concede that 

we have other posts, a substantial number of

 other posts, that are private.

 So, first, I guess, what is your 

answer to could the public official who uses 

this to communicate with the public sometimes,

 could they block a person who made comments 

about the dogs or not? 

MR. KEDEM: So, certainly, they 

could --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is that state 

action? 

MR. KEDEM: Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Excuse me. Is it 

state action --

MR. KEDEM: So -- so --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- to block a 

comment about the dogs? 

MR. KEDEM: So I think the answer is, 

if you're talking just about removing a comment 

from a specific post, it is only state action if 

the post itself has something to do with the 

job. And I think this goes back to the Chief

 Justice's questions about whether all of a

 sudden it means that you basically have to let 

the government control all the posting that you

 do about your cats or dogs.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.

 MR. KEDEM: The answer is no because 

the posting about the cats or dogs is not state 

action. But, if you're talking about blocking 

someone's access to the entire page for all time 

on a going-forward basis, then, obviously, it 

matters not just the specific post that led you 

to take that action but all of the other 

information that they're losing out on. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you're saying 

there is a situation -- was that the case in 

your situation where the -- the block resulted 

in no access to this page at all? 

MR. KEDEM: Yes.  So two things 

happened.  He had comments removed, but, also, 

he was blocked so that he could not access the 

page when he was signed in.  And there were four 

other people who also either had comments 

deleted or were blocked, all of whom, because --

it was because they essentially criticized the 

way that Mr. Freed was performing his -- his job

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTORIA R. FERRES

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. FERRES: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court: 

This country's 21 million government 

employees should have the right to talk publicly 

about their jobs on personal social media 

accounts like their private-sector counterparts. 

As this Court addresses the question 

presented, this Court should adopt the Sixth 

Circuit's duty and authority or state official 

test because it complies with this Court's 

precedent and requires that a government 

employee is either exercising power possessed by 

virtue of state law or made possible only 

because he is clothed with the authority of 

state law. 

Petitioner wrongly advocates for an 

inherently subjective test that divorces the 

state action inquiry from state law.

 Petitioner's test will result in uncertainty and

 self-censorship for this country's government 

employees despite this Court repeatedly finding

 that government employees do not lose their 

rights merely by virtue of public employment.

 James Freed's Facebook account is the

 perfect example of the danger of Petitioner's

 test. Mr. Freed opened a personal Facebook

 count in -- account in 2008 as a college student 

at Indiana Wesleyan University. 

For 12 years, he built up the account 

to interact with friends, family members, and 

colleagues to talk about his passions and 

interests, including his wife, daughter, his 

dog, his work, and his favorite Bible passages. 

As he had done for over a decade while 

operating the account, in 2020, Mr. Freed made a 

private choice like any other Facebook user 

could do to block Petitioner and delete 

Petitioner's comments from the page. 

After being sued, Mr. Freed 

deactivated the page and stopped speaking to his 

family and friends and the public on Facebook 

because he did not want to lose control over his 

own speech by the threat of state action.

Such self-censorship for government 

employees will not only have a negative impact

 on society -- on government employees themselves

 but as society -- in addition to society as a 

whole as the voices that may advance knowledge 

and the search for the truth will be silenced.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  There's quite a bit 

on the site about personal activities, including 

the battles with raccoons and other things, but 

Petitioner says that the balance changes 

somewhat during COVID, during the COVID crisis. 

Would you react to that and whether or 

not that sort of episode is enough to convert 

this into a -- a -- into a -- an official 

activity on this site as opposed to a personal 

site? 

MS. FERRES: Yes, Justice Thomas.  So, 

when you look at the -- from the Joint Appendix 

from 15 to 24, you can see that from the time 

that COVID started in March of 2020 through the 

day that put -- the post in which Petitioner 

claims he was then blocked and deleted, Mr. 

Freed only makes 14 posts.  And just to give 

some -- or some context to that, from March 2019

 MS. FERRES: No, Your Honor.  And he

really look at those 14 posts, all he was doing

nonprofit entities, there was other government 

agencies that weren't the City of Port Huron. 

He was sharing information just like

anyone else during COVID, so nothing changed

the Facebook page, they decided to host a -- a 

city council meeting in his -- on -- on Facebook

period of time, there may be state action in 

that case. 

And I think that's where the 

notice-and-comment comes in, because the city 

council meeting inherently has a right to access 

to the public. They're able to come for public 

comment.

 not looking to anything objective.  We're 

looking to Petitioners' subjective criteria.

So, for example, when he issued the

 water directive, that would have been sent to

 the water department, and, of course, when he 

did that, there's state action there.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what if many

They didn't want to go to the water site and the 

roads site and the COVID site and the healthcare 

site and the "this site" and the "that."  I 

mean, he was the one-stop shopping, and they 

could see pictures of his dog too and that was 

nice. So this is where they went for their 

information about what was happening in town.

his dog, but, Your Honor, he -- in this case, he

see his site.  There was -- he didn't -- his --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you don't think

 that managing the government -- managing 

everything that goes on in the town, that it

 helps to have a -- a channel of communication to

 your constituents, to the people who live in the

 town?

 MS. FERRES: Your Honor, I think

 that's -- that's obvious in any type of position

 like that.  Any governmental position would want 

to have some type of communication with the 

public. But that doesn't mean that every single 

thing, every single time a government employee 

talks about their job and they happen to be in 

public, that it transforms into state action. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Well, I think the 

problem is they define the custom, I think, of 

positions like this as including communicating 

with the public about your job, and, therefore, 

everything that you communicate about your job 

becomes state action.  So that's a problem for 

them as I see it because that seems very broad 

to me. 

But then how would you define it short 

of that?  And be very specific.  For example,

 COVID, where -- like, where do you draw the line 

short of the line that I think the other side

 has?

 MS. FERRES: Justice Kavanaugh, I

 think that your hypotheticals in the last case 

made the most sense and that when, if you have a 

duty to announce a rule and the only time that 

you ever do it is on the Facebook page, then 

there's going to be state action there.  If he 

had an explicit duty to do something and that's 

the only time he's carrying it out, yes. 

But, if he's merely reposting or 

resharing the official action that he had 

already taken, there's no state action in that 

case. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And on the 

resharing thing, I guess -- this is a helpful 

question for you, but just to think it through, 

I guess the point there is any citizen could be 

resharing it, not -- not -- it's not unique to 

the -- the city manager, I suppose. 

But I think the response to that, just 

to continue it, as Justice Kagan would say, a 

lot of people are going to rely -- her question

the city manager to be the place you go for that

 information.

 MS. FERRES: Your Honor, a couple

 things in response to this.  But just the clout 

of someone's job doesn't transform something

 into state action.  So many more people may 

attend Mr. Freed's birthday party because he is 

the city manager, but just that clout of his job 

alone and the fact that people may be going to 

his Facebook page because he is the city manager 

isn't enough to get us into state action. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And one thing you 

said I think I disagree with pretty strongly, 

which is that it's not part of your duties to 

communicate as a city manager with the public. 

I would think, it -- as a customary matter, that 

would always be -- maybe you didn't say that, so 

I'll give you an opportunity to amend that if 

you want. 

MS. FERRES: No, Your Honor.  I think,

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So Justice Sotomayor 

was asking in the last argument about the Sixth 

Circuit's test and whether it relied solely on 

written law and excluded custom. But you've 

been talking back and forth with Justice 

Kavanaugh about custom and customary duties. 

So do you agree that custom can be 

part of the source of an -- of authority or 

duty? 

MS. FERRES: No, not exactly, Your 

Honor, but I do think that there could be -- I 

think the Sixth Circuit used the phrase 

"apparent duty," so I -- I guess what I would 

say is if the city council directed Mr. Freed to

 media account. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: But 1983, I mean,

 clearly, custom can be enough.

 MS. FERRES: Correct.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Custom or policy, so

 do you really want to fight that that hard?

 MS. FERRES: I -- I don't disagree 

that 1983 says statute, ordinance, regulation, 

custom, or usage.  So that -- we don't have to 

look just to -- just to state law, but I think 

the only case this Court has ever really 

addressed with custom was Adickes, and it had to 

be something that was so forceful that it 

essentially was the law.  So, when we look at 

that case, they weren't letting any blacks into 

the -- at the counter to eat, and it was --

there was a police officer in there enforcing 

that custom. 

So we don't have anything like that in 

this case where it's something so defined that 

it becomes essentially a duty. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, why I -- I 

guess -- I understand your argument to be with 

respect to the need for some sort of clarity,

bright line, the public officials have a First

 Amendment right and they need to know when 

they're going to be able to exercise it. I

 appreciate that.

           But I guess I thought that we had a 

line of cases like the Pickering and Garcetti 

cases in which those kinds of issues were taken 

into account and the Court did not choose a

 bright-line test. In other words, in the 

Pickering scenario, where the public employees 

are trying to speak on matters of public concern 

and the government doesn't want them to speak, I 

suppose the Court could -- could have adopted 

some sort of a bright line as to when -- when 

are you speaking in your public capacity and 

when are you not. 

But we said that it's a practical 

inquiry and that the listing of a given task in 

the employee's written job description is 

neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate 

that conducting the task is within the -- the 

scope of the -- the professional duties. 

So it seems to me like you are arguing 

for a bright-line listing of the duty or some 

kind of clear way to know in a circumstance in

 MS. FERRES: Your Honor, I -- I don't 

think it's only looking at the specific duty or

 that bright line, but I think what -- what I

 mean when I say the term "bright line" is that 

there's some type of objective indicia of the 

duty and authority and where the Sixth Circuit, 

I think, was correct in saying that, you know, 

you can look whether government employees are 

helping the person maintain the page, if 

government funds are used, if the government 

page is owned by the government, if it -- once 

-- in Mr. Freed's case, if once he leaves the 

city manager position, if then the next city 

manager is going to take over that account.  So 

these are all objective indicia of --

there is duty and authority because that's what

 this Court's precedent in state action has

 required, that there -- you're exercising some 

type of rights and responsibilities made

 possible only because you have the authority of

 state law.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that seems

 to me not adequate at all, but every elected 

official tells me that they're on duty 24 hours 

a day. And so, if they are during that 24 hours 

creating themselves and posting the Facebook and 

doing all of the communications they're doing, 

why isn't that state action? 

If you're using government resources, 

you're a government resource.  You're a 

government employee.  And if you're claiming 

you're on duty 24 hours, then you are. And you 

are using a state resource.  So it can't be as 

limited as you say.

violate the government employee's First 

Amendment rights because we know from Lane that

here is duty or authority, and we think how that 

test plays out in a case like this one that's 

about denial of access to property should look 

closely to the nature of the property. 

And so we're trying to get at whether 

this is an exercise of state power, and, Justice 

Barrett, we're happy to view this as evidence of 

that, but we think that the -- the heuristic or 

the way the Court should look at this set of 

cases is that state action generally exists in a 

denial of access to property case, where either 

the government controls the property, such as an 

official Facebook page, or a defendant is 

exercising a duty that itself requires providing 

access, such as conducting a city council

 meeting on Facebook Live, or, Justice Jackson, 

in his backyard, that's something that requires

 providing access, so that would be something

 that's an exercise of state power.

 By contrast, the appearance and 

content test that my friend on the other side

 advances imperils the freedom of a government 

official to speak as a public citizen on matters 

of public concern. And I think the facts here 

are a perfect example. 

Mr. Freed posted on Facebook on his 

own time on a page he had created long before. 

He didn't use any government devices.  He didn't 

use government resources.  And still, because, 

like most people on Facebook, he was talking 

about the pandemic in March of 2020 and because 

that overlapped with the subject matter of his 

job, my friend on the other side says that that 

became -- state action such that constitutional 

constraints applied, such that he was required 

to allow comments he disagreed with or people he 

found creepy. 

And I think that that has really 

serious repercussions.  I think both just in the 

Facebook context specifically, I think, as the

 Chief Justice pointed out, that does mean

 employer control.

 That means that the City of Port Huron

 could say here, Mr. Freed, no Bible verses on

 your page. He had Bible verses on his page.

 Because this is state action, that means it's 

our speech and we don't want biblical verses on

 our pages.  That would be something the

 government could do if this is state action, and 

so it falls into the Garcetti bucket instead of 

the Pickering bucket. 

And I think it also has major 

repercussions for the physical world because, if 

appearance and content can convert something 

using purely private resources that has no 

government ownership into state action, that 

means that when Mr. Freed goes to the hardware 

store and maybe he's wearing his city manager 

pin and he's talking to people, those people 

have access to the government in that instance 

because he's knowledgeable about that material. 

And that suggests that suddenly he 

might be subject to constitutional constraints 

or, if he's having people over for a dinner 

party, either friends or a kitchen cabinet of

informal advisors whose views he shares, if he

 talks too much about his job, if he identifies 

himself as a city manager or they know that

 position, that means that he loses the ability 

to have those conversations in his private

 capacity.

 And that's why we think it's so

 important to look at what the actual duties of 

the job were that he was exercising, and just 

this idea that anytime you're having a 

conversation with the public, that becomes state 

action, I think, is a really dangerous idea. 

And to look specifically at what Mr. 

Freed's duties were in this case, Justice 

Kavanaugh, I think different city managers might 

have different roles.  But Mr. Freed's role, 

which I -- is set out in Section 2013 of the 

city code and (c)(51) of the charter, is really 

not a public-facing role. He reports to the 

city council.  He issues administrative 

directives.  He manages other officials. 

I think, if you look at that set of 

duties, it's clear that he's not the person 

who's in charge of communicating to the public.

on the other side position on these facts is so

 extreme.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In the physical world,

 practical limitations severely limit the ability 

of government officials to move what look very 

much like government events or functions onto

 private property.  And so your property-based 

rule may make more sense in that -- in that

 world, but it -- it doesn't cost anything to 

open a Facebook page. 

And so to make so much turn on who 

owns the Facebook page seems quite artificial. 

You know, if the mayor of a small town could 

have everybody -- could have a -- what looks 

like a quasi-public meeting on -- on the farm, 

but somebody who -- an elected public official 

in a jurisdiction with millions of people can't 

do that. 

MS. HANSFORD:  So -- so, Justice 

Alito, I agree that if there is a duty to do a 

certain thing, then the fact that it's happening 

on private property, whether it's the farm or 

the Facebook Live or the private Zoom isn't 

going to change that.  The government official 

can't take things away.  If they're carrying out

 But I think we have to be really 

careful before assuming that something that's

 happening on private property is state action 

just because it's talking about the subject 

matter, absent some duty to have that

 conversation.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, duty -- if duty 

is positive law, then that's a pretty clear, 

sharp limitation.  But, if you say -- if you 

agree that custom -- a duty can -- can arise 

from custom, do you -- you agree with that? 

MS. HANSFORD:  I agree with that but 

in the narrow sense, the Adickes sense of custom 

that has the force of law, that's how this Court 

has defined it in the 1983 context.  So, when 

there is such a strong norm in a town that if 

you allow your diner to serve racially diverse 

groups like the facts in Adickes unsegregated 

groups, the sheriff will come and will -- will 

beat you up and there will be negative 

repercussions that -- I think that is the form 

of custom. I don't want to be too rigid --

 Communicating with constituents is not a -- a

not an elected official. He's an appointed 

official. But setting that aside, there are --

 there are roles in which communicating with the 

public is part of the job, but that is also 

something that any public official can do as a 

private citizen, and we have to tell which. 

And if it's happening on private 

property, we should be really careful in 

assuming that that is the exercise of a public 

duty because that takes away the public 

official's ability to ever communicate with the 

public or, on matters of public concern, say

becomes official action even though you could

MS. HANSFORD:  That's right, Justice 

Kavanaugh.  And I think this Court has already 

said that in cases like Lane and Garcetti where 

it warned against overbroad descriptions. 

So, even if the employee manual or the 

city charter here said your duty is to 

communicate with the public, it can't be that 

every time Mr. Freed does it, whether it's at 

church or at his own house, that is state action 

that the government can control. That subjects 

him to viewpoint limitations, which are things

 think the record here is very clear on that, and 

I think that both of the lower courts looked at

 it to some extent -- probably at pages 24

government time.  There's no use of government

aspect of this?  We know that -- that -- that 

Facebook itself is -- is operating in this space

thing. Does that matter to your private 

analysis?

if anything, more private, that Facebook also 

had the authority to take down this account.  We

 This may be following up a little bit

 on -- on Justice Jackson's point, but -- and I 

don't mean this in any pejorative way to the 

analysis at all, but I was very surprised in 

reading the brief to see all the emphasis on 

private property.  I mean, usually, we're told 

in these, you know, social media, whatever, 

cases that it's not a question of a physical 

asset. 

And in what sense is this really 

private property?  They're -- it's just the 

gathering of the protons or whatever they are. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they pop 

up on his page and they could pop up on somebody 

else's page.  So, I mean, is that -- I guess --

should I be concerned about the fact that we 

have this old concept applied to what we always 

say is some new phenomenon?  And I'm not sure 

that it works in the sense that it's actually --

it's not Blackacre.  It's -- it's a machine and

 somebody else's machine can pick it up if you 

want. It's -- it's -- it seems incongruous to

 me.

 MS. HANSFORD:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 

-- this Court has often looked to private 

property analogies, whether the property is 

physical or virtual, whether it's access to a 

public access channel in the Halleck case or the

 Combined Federal Campaign in Cornelius.  What --

the question here is a denial of access, and 

we're trying to figure out if this is an 

exercise of state power. 

And -- that you don't need any state 

power to block someone on Facebook.  This is not 

a case where you -- it's an officer wearing a 

uniform flashing a badge and the blocking is 

somehow more effective before -- because you're 

an officer.  So we think the analogy is fully on 

point, even though it's virtual, not physical. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 

Justice Thomas? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yes.  This is 

probably not relevant in this case, but looming 

in the background is the power of Facebook 

itself to block these accounts.  And what's

 curious to me is that there's that elephant in

 the room and we don't discuss -- we decline to 

discuss it in the context of private property,

 your -- your approach.

           Is there any role for consideration of 

the fact that Facebook could also influence

 who's blocked and who's not blocked?

 MS. HANSFORD:  Justice Thomas, and I

 mentioned to Justice Jackson, at most, that's an 

additional reason to not find state action here, 

but we ultimately don't think that the fact that 

Facebook also could exercise control is 

important because this is not a case where 

Facebook purported to exercise that control. 

I believe my colleague gave this 

example in the first argument, but it's like if 

the government rents a ballroom for an official 

meeting and then excludes someone from that 

meeting, that is exercising its governmental 

authority as an entity that's controlling that 

ballroom for this period, even if the hotel 

could say, oh, this whole meeting is too rowdy, 

we're going to kick everybody out.  That may not 

be state action on the hotel's part at all. 

And I think the Facebook's role

 question is a lurking one that we don't need to

 address here.  But, here, where -- it -- it --

when the owner of the Facebook page or the 

controller of the Facebook page is the one 

that's doing the blocking, I think you can focus 

on that person's control even if it's not the 

full bundle of property rights, but just the 

ability to exclude for the temporary period

 until Facebook vetoes it or kicks them off 

entirely.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It just seems to 

me that you want a set of strong rules that make 

nothing state action, really, because you keep 

saying you can only have authority if the state 

is providing resources, personnel, time for 

personnel, whatever.  And you're saying it's 

only a duty if it's written basically. 

And you're saying -- you're giving in 

a little bit to a strong social norm, but I 

don't even know what a strong social norm is 

because a lot of situations, especially in the 

workplace, can't be described that way.

on that last question about somebody who 

preempts the official announcement, those are

 not the facts here.  And I think my friend

 misstated that, but Petition Appendix page 25a

 shows that -- that there's nothing in this

 record --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But your test is 

not taking care of that. Neither is the Sixth

 Circuit's test taking care of either of these 

two situations. 

MS. HANSFORD:  But -- but I think even 

in the case where you're preempting the 

announcement that ends up being announced 

somewhere else, that's also something the 

government official could do by telling just his 

friends.  Government officials are allowed to 

talk about things that are the subject matter of 

their job, and if the employer doesn't want them 

to do that, that can be something that the 

employer can regulate.  But, if they're doing 

something additional that they're not required 

to do and if they're doing it on private time 

and on private property, we don't want to assume 

that they're exercising state power.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that takes

 away from the Griffin case because a private

 citizen can choose to make an arrest.  So can a

 deputy choose to make an arrest. What changed

 it in Griffin was the fact that he was wearing 

the deputy badge and purporting to act as a

 government official.

 Similarly here, he's disclosing 

information that's private to his job and using 

the site to make people realize or believe that 

he is performing a social function by being the 

first to give them the news. 

MS. HANSFORD:  So, Justice Sotomayor, 

when you're conducting an arrest or ordering 

somebody to leave, exercising governmental 

authority and appearing to be exercising 

governmental authority changes the nature of 

what you're doing.  It's giving you additional 

power that a private rent-a-cop does not have to 

obtain compliance. 

And so we think the analogy to the 

Griffin case would be, if Mr. Freed went on 

Facebook and said, by the authority of city 

manager, I hereby order everybody to stay at 

home under penalty of fines, and then the fact

that he appeared official and that -- that --

that might matter.  But that is not any of the 

facts here, and that is not the power that is

 being exercised by blocking someone.

 Just talking about things, as Your

 Honor's opinion in Lane makes clear, talking 

about your job is not something that the state 

has a monopoly on and that government employees

 can only do in their official capacity.  That's 

what makes these cases hard, and that's why we 

need to figure out if the official was speaking 

as a private citizen or not.  And we think that 

if it's happening on private property on private 

time, you -- you should be really careful, 

without a more specific duty, to infer that. 

But just the -- one last point.  The 

duty doesn't need to be spelled out in minute 

detail.  In your case about the teacher, the 

teacher's job in the classroom is to teach and 

mentor her students, and if she's doing those 

things in the classroom, the fact that handing 

out gifts is not specifically delineated I don't 

think is going to make a difference. 

I think that's also probably true of 

Justice Kagan's example of the road closures.

If the duty is to provide information in

 emergency situations, the fact that it doesn't 

say provide information about road closures as a 

specific thing doesn't matter. The means don't 

need to be spelled out. It's still part of the

 duty.

 But, if this is just general speaking 

about the pandemic, before you take that away

 from a public official as a private citizen, you 

want to be really care -- really sure it's part 

of his job by looking at something more 

specific, and we just don't have that here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Hansford, take 

this as another version of the Chief Justice's 

question about the apparent -- let's call it 

archaic nature of your -- your test, and I guess 

what strikes me about it is that, you know, it's 

hard to predict the future, but change has 

happened very quickly in the last however many 

years and is going to continue to happen. 

And part of that change is that more 

and more of our government operates on social 

media. More and more of our democracy operates 

on social media.  Public discourse, this is the

citizens to talk to officials, for citizens to 

talk to each other, and it is becoming

 increasingly so.

 And I worry that the rules that you're 

suggesting and even the analogies that you're 

proposing as though we can satisfy our -- our --

as we can -- we can solve this case by thinking 

about grocery stores is really not taking into 

account the big picture of how much is going to 

be happening in this forum and how much citizens 

will be foreclosed from participating in our 

democracy if the kind of rule you're advocating 

goes into effect. 

So I guess I would like you to comment 

on that.  You know, it's a big-picture challenge 

about the nature of the world we live in and 

we're going to live in and the need for rules 

that are going to meet a world that we don't 

really have any idea what it will look like.

that social media is important and is increasing

enough to capture that because I think that

it is now a duty of many officials as one of

 their jobs to run an official social media 

account or to have a social media presence or to

 engage in conversations on social media.  And as 

the duties change, then I think that will become

 state action.

 But I -- our -- our submission is that 

in a case where running the Facebook account is 

extra or, in this case, when somebody is running 

a personal Facebook account and happens to talk 

about topics that matter to his employer, as 

well as to his community and to him personally, 

that's not enough. 

And I think one way to see that this 

is an extra bucket as opposed to a duty bucket 

is that Mr. Freed was able to just take down his 

Facebook page when he was upset at being subject 

to these private capacity suits. He was able 

just to take it down.  That's just less speech. 

And if this were a part of his duty, 

if the mayor said no, no, we really need you to 

have a Facebook presence, Facebook is critical 

for the city to communicate with the government, 

he wouldn't have been allowed to do that, but 

then he would have been running the Facebook

have, you know, a big concert, Taylor Swift has 

a big concert in a private, you know, area, a 

park or something, and the police recognize 

there are going to be large crowds, et cetera, 

and so they come and they help with the 

screening of the bags and they, you know, kick 

out people who are rowdy and they're controlling 

access to this area of the private area of this. 

Because it's private, we would say 

that's not state action or --

it, that that would --

 MS. HANSFORD:  -- that would be state

on Facebook because anyone can block equally, 

and saying I block a city manager doesn't make 

it any more of a block than just hitting block. 

If we had a world where Facebook 

didn't have a blocking function, then maybe 

saying, oh, if you come back to my account then 

post again, the city will fine you.  I'm saying 

this as city manager, that would be an instance

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KEDEM: Thank you, Your Honor.

 I'd like to start by addressing the 

test proposed by the United States. I think it

 has a number of problems, but I'd like to focus

 on two of them. 

First of all, the test is all about

 denial of access to property.  But many disputes 

on social media have nothing to do with access. 

They have to do with discrimination or other 

forms of constitutional harm. 

We gave the example of a teaching 

assistant at a public university who on Twitter 

made a number of anti-Semitic comments about 

students in her class, has nothing to do with 

access. 

But it doesn't make sense to have one 

state action test for access cases online and 

another state action test for all the other 

cases, even assuming that we can figure out what 

denial of access means in the context of all of 

these different platforms and their various 

functions. 

And, second, the test proposed by the

United States is an obvious doctrinal mismatch 

because it relies on cases about the use of 

private property, which, because it's private

 property, it has some governmental involvement, 

but it has to be pretty extraordinary to 

overcome the very strong default presumption

 that private property is just not used for state

 action ever.

 And for that reason, the government 

says, essentially, only if you are performing an 

exclusive public function does it ever count as 

state action.  But, as this Court is very --

well aware, very few things qualify as exclusive 

public functions.  Even something like providing 

a public education is not an exclusive public 

function. 

And for that reason, under the 

government's test, public officials could 

transfer a lot of what they do to private 

property and thereby escape constitutional 

scrutiny. 

I'd like to end by talking about the 

different values on both sides of the equation 

because this Court has always been mindful in 

the state action context about the

constitutional values that are at stake.

 In -- on our side, we're talking about

 creation of a channel of communication between a

 public official and their constituents about how

 they're doing their job.  So we're not talking

 about these one-off posts or fortuitous 

encounters that are essentially the online

 equivalent of running into someone at the

 grocery store.  Instead, we're talking about 

denial of access to the channel altogether. 

And I think that there are four 

general values.  First of all, we've talked a 

lot about losing out on access to information. 

Some information is only going to be available 

on the private Facebook page of public 

officials.  Sometimes it will only be available 

at a certain time or in a certain form. 

Sometimes it will be available somewhere else, 

but it'll be scattered to the four corners of 

the Internet. 

But, second, you lose access to the 

public official him or herself.  There were a 

number of instances where Mr. Freed would 

explain a directive that he himself had issued 

to say it applies not just to people who are

about to have their water cut off but to people

 who have already had their water cut off. 

That's something you would only know if you were 

able to interact with him and ask him a question

 online.

 The third value, as, Justice Kagan, 

you were pointing out, this is also a place

 where members of the town came to talk to one 

another, and that is part of the give-and-take 

of local self-government. 

And, finally, I think there's a 

dignitary interest.  To the extent that we're 

not just talking about someone doing this, 

blocking information, you had the information, 

but now you don't have it, it also matters that 

it is the government who is doing it to you. 

Now we have an example in our brief 

about a public school teacher who holds an 

end-of-the-school -- end-of-year party at her 

own house.  So there's no duty, there's no 

authority being used.  She's not using any state 

funds. But she only invites the white students 

from her class. 

We think that would be an obvious 

constitutional problem.  But it's not a problem

because of any sort of coercion. It's not a

 problem because of use of state resources.  And

 it's not really about denial of access to pizza

 and ice cream.

 Really, it's a dignitary harm that it 

is someone from the government treating you in a 

particular way that you should not be treated.

 And that's, I think, something that gets lost 

when you don't take account of the fact that he 

was holding himself out as the city manager, 

establishing this channel, talking to citizens 

in that capacity. 

There are also First Amendment values 

on the other side of the equation, and we admit 

that, although, again, we think they're somewhat 

limited when we're just talking about the 

channel that you've established and whether you 

can block access to that channel, as opposed to 

control over all of your other posts about dogs 

or other things like that. 

I think, to a large extent, the other 

side undercuts their own First Amendment 

argument when they freely admit that the 

government as employer could basically tell them 

to do all of the things that we say they should

a second Facebook account where they just talk 

about their job or, at the very least, if you're

 going to invoke your title, then make clear when

 you're talking in your personal capacity and 

make clear when you're talking in your

 professional capacity.

 So, to some extent, they're already 

undercutting their own First Amendment rights. 

But we do admit that if you establish a channel 

as a public official purporting to be a public 

official, you do lose some amount of control and 

you will be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. 

A lot of times, you can still block people for 

various reasons. 

But we think that as Justice Scalia 

put it in his concurrence in Doe versus Reed, 

criticism is traditionally the price that we 

have been willing to pay for self-government.
