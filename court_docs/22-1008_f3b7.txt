 (10:01 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-1008, 

Corner Post versus the Board of Governors of the

 Federal Reserve System.

 Mr. Weir.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN K. WEIR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. WEIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Corner Post opened for business in 

2018. Since then, it's paid several hundred 

thousand dollars in debit card fees that it 

thinks are unlawful.  But the government says 

that Corner Post's clock to challenge those fees 

actually started in 2011, seven years before 

Corner Post pumped a single gallon of gas. 

The government is wrong.  Corner 

Post's clock started when it swiped its first 

debit card and paid its first fee.  That is the 

right outcome here for three main reasons. 

First and most importantly, the text. 

Section 2401's limitations period starts when a 

claim "first accrues."  This Court has said that

phrase means the clock starts only once a

 plaintiff can sue, and this Court has also said

 that an APA plaintiff can sue only once it's

 first harmed by regulation.  We just want the 

Court to apply those settled principles.

 By contrast, the government wants a 

special rule that contradicts how accrual 

statutes have worked since at least the 1830s.

 That government-only carveout would convert 

Section 2401 into a repose-based statute like 

the Hobbs Act.  But Congress knows exactly how 

to craft repose-based statutes when it wants to, 

and it hasn't done so for APA claims. 

Second, with no textual foothold, the 

government resorts to policy arguments.  It says 

that siding with Corner Post will undermine 

reliance interests because it will let 

plaintiffs challenge rules that are older than 

six years.  But challenges to those rules 

already happen all the time in the as-applied 

context, and the government admits that 

as-applied challenges have no time limit. 

Third, if Congress's textual choice 

leads to outcomes that the government doesn't 

like, this Court has said that those concerns

should be addressed to Congress, not to this

 Court. This Court's role is simply to enforce 

the value judgments that Congress has already

 made. We ask that it do so here.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you have any 

examples of accrual cases or questions where the 

injury and the unlawful conduct are on different

 dates? 

MR. WEIR: Well, that -- that --

that's really any typical accrual statute.  For 

example, there are torts where a -- where a --

where a tort is committed and -- and the cause 

of action is not complete until later, until the 

harm is felt.  So that's a basic.  We think 

there's nothing remarkable about -- about --

about that fact pattern. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, but -- it --

how many cases are like yours, where the 

regulation has been adopted, it's final, and you 

are not yet in business, so it can't apply to 

you and -- so are there any cases like yours --

MR. WEIR: So --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- where the injury 

is later?

MR. WEIR: -- so we -- we think that

 repose-based statutes that would -- that would 

cut off review for someone like us, but the APA

so do you have any other cases like yours?

more interested in the fact pattern that we have

 here. Your business -- you have a rule that's

 adopted.  It's final.  It's been challenged. 

Then you go into business, you begin to operate 

under these rules, and you claim, of course, 

that's the beginning of your injury, and then, 

of course, you say that restarts the statute of

 limitations.

 That's what I'm interested in. 

MR. WEIR: So in the -- in the -- in 

the regulatory context or --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yes. 

MR. WEIR: And so, in the regulatory 

context, as far as we know, the APA -- the 2401

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah.

 MR. WEIR: And so there wouldn't be 

other cases because they would have been

 time-barred under that rule.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, there --

there is something about this that plagues at 

the back of my mind, which is, how can someone 

be injured who goes into a business knowing its 

structure?  Meaning this is the business that 

you've accepted.  The rule was passed whatever 

number of years ago.  There's no enforcement 

against you. 

I understand injury when the 

government's seeking to compel you to do 

something or to stop doing something.  But 

there's no injury in my mind when you enter a 

business knowing its structure and accepting 

rules that have been final. 

So explain to me what makes sense in 

-- this has often been called a facial challenge 

as opposed to an as-applied challenge, and I 

think that -- for valid reasons, which is, if 

you go in, you accept the regulatory conditions 

of the business, and you're not burdened because

you knew it going in.

 MR. WEIR: Well, I think that assumes

 that -- that small business owners understand 

the entire regulatory regime that they're

 entering before they actually go into business. 

And I think this Court has recognized that it is 

-- that is a tall task to ask of any small 

business owner like Corner Post.

 But the first time Corner Post was 

ever actually injured is the time that they --

they did pay the actual debit card fees that --

that they had to pay whenever they swiped a 

debit card.  So that's the first time there is 

any injury. 

And so accrual-based statutes, this 

Court has -- has, I think, recognized throughout 

history, are necessarily plaintiff-specific, and 

that's exactly what we have here. The first 

time the plaintiff here was harmed is when that 

plaintiff's cause of action accrues to challenge 

that particular rule. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think what 

Justice Thomas's question suggested is that this 

is a context in which this would be a quite 

novel rule.  There are no other statutes of

 limitations that work this way.  And with 

respect to this statute of limitations, the

 consensus view of all the circuits, until the

 Herr came -- case came along, which was fairly

 recently, a little bit different context, but

 the consensus view of all the circuits was that 

the statute of limitations began to run when you

 had final agency action.

 Of course, what typically would 

happen, a rule like this, is that there would be 

that final agency action, many people would 

challenge the rule, trade associations of the 

same kind that are in back of this case, that 

that challenge would go forward. You would get 

a decision.  It would be final.  It would create 

the legal background rule sometimes for an 

entire industry, and that was the end of the 

matter. 

And, you know, what you're suggesting 

is a very different rule than the administrative 

sphere has worked under for many, many years. 

MR. WEIR: So we don't think so.  I --

I think that the -- the -- the 29 examples that 

the government points out in its brief of 

agency-specific repose-based statutes shows that

Congress intended to have a different rule for

 the APA.  It has not subjected --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it doesn't show

 that. I mean, the APA, you're right, it's

 different language.  It says "accrues."  Now,

 you know, "accrues" just means arises.  There's 

nothing in the language itself that -- that

 would suggest that your principle is mandated.

 We do, you're quite right, have a 

general principle that when we see something 

that says "accrues," what that usually means is 

that there's a -- a -- a full cause of action 

that can be brought. 

But this is a very different context 

in which the rule has operated differently for 

decades and decades and decades, where no court 

has ever suggested your solution until, again, 

the Herr case.  And I -- I guess I would suggest 

there's nothing in the word "accrues" that 

suggests that every court for decades and 

decades and decades has been wrong. 

MR. WEIR: So -- so two responses, 

Justice Kagan.  The first is, if you look at 

those lower court decisions applying this 

statutory scheme, not a single one of them

None of them did.

 And then the pathmarking decision I --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but what I'm

 suggesting, Mr. Weir, is that there's not much 

in the text to look at. "Accrues" just means

 arises.  Now we do have precedent, but that 

precedent arose in a very different context as 

to what "accrues" meant, so you wouldn't find a 

lot looking at this text. 

MR. WEIR: So I -- I disagree with 

that as well. I think this Court definitively 

interpreted the phrase "first accrues" in 

Gabelli versus SEC just 11 years ago, and it 

said, in common parlance, a right first accrues 

when it comes into existence.  And that was 

under the administrative --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We made very clear 

that that was a default rule, a general rule 

that could be, of course, countermanded by 

Congress but that also could be countermanded by 

different circumstances, that if you look at the 

Crown Coat opinion, for example, there's a very 

explicit recognition by this Court -- and I'm 

just reading -- "the hazards inherent in

hazards, you know, a word like that should be

 "interpreted in the light of the general 

purposes of the statute, with due regard to

that the government relies on, we see that as a 

recognition that obviously the underlying cause

 of action accrue -- is -- differs between causes 

of action. Torts accrue at different times than

 breaches of contract.  Different torts can

 accrue differ -- at different times.  And so we

 just see that language as just recognizing that.

 And as far as if you -- the -- the 

purposes of the statute, this Court said in 

Abbott Lab'ys the purpose of the APA was it --

it embodies a presumption of judicial review. 

So, if we're going to look at the underlying 

statute and its purposes, I think that cuts our 

way, not the government's way. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. -- Mr. Weir, 

I -- I thought that we had sort of basic first 

principles governing statutes of limitations, 

and it sort of goes to what Justice Kagan 

pointed out, but I thought that we ordinarily 

say that a cause of action arises, which is 

accrues, it arises, when all of the facts that 

are necessary to establish the elements of that 

cause of action have occurred. 

You know, in a tort situation, when 

there's a duty, if there's a breach and injury

as a result of the breach, those facts have

 occurred, the cause of action has arisen, and we 

say the clock starts running at that point 

because a claim against the defendant can be

 sustained in court when those facts exist.

 All right. So, if that's right as a 

first principle, I guess I don't understand your 

argument that the cause of action is arising 

here when the plaintiff can bring the claim. 

I think the law regarding to -- you 

know, when a plaintiff can bring a claim is 

something different.  But we have here a cause 

of action arising out of the final agency action 

because that is the point at which a person can 

sustain a claim against the agency under the 

APA. 

Why am I wrong about that? 

MR. WEIR: So this -- this Court has 

identified the elements of an APA claim and it 

requires a plaintiff who is injured and injured 

by agency action.  So those are the elements. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Where -- where --

where have we said that that was an element?  I 

thought that was just a statement of the statute

not -- not like the element of the claim, when 

has the defendant violated the law.

 MR. WEIR: So I would point the Court 

to the Lujan decision, 1990, where it outlines 

the elements of an APA claim.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mm-hmm.

 MR. WEIR: The Court -- Court dealt 

with it there. But you can look at the statute

 itself.  Section 702 identifies who, a person. 

That who has -- that's who has the cause of 

action, a person. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  Who has the 

cause of action.  I'm talking about what are the 

elements of the cause of action, and I thought 

it was the agency has enacted a final rule that 

you claim is arbitrary and capricious or not in 

accordance with the law, that once the agency 

has done that, we have a cause of action, it has 

arisen, and then these other elements or these 

other aspects of the statute say who is the 

person who can bring such a claim. 

MR. WEIR: So I disagree with that. 

This Court has said that certainly final agency 

action is an element of an APA claim, but the 

other element, as this Court noted in Lujan and

I think in Newport News, is somebody who is 

actually harmed by it, a plaintiff who was

 harmed by it.

 And accrual-based statutes are

 necessarily plaintiff-specific.  They are in --

 that's in an accrual -- that's in their DNA.

 We're not aware of a -- a -- a statute that uses 

accrual language or accrual-like language where 

the statute of limitations starts on the first 

day and ends on the first day for everyone, and 

we think that's because that's not an accrual 

statute, that's a statute of repose. 

And Congress certainly knows how to 

pass those, and Congress knew how to pass those 

when it passed the APA.  In 1940 -- in 1934, 

there -- there -- Congress passed a -- a -- a 

sort of Hobbs Act-like statute for the SEC. It 

did so in 1938 for the FTC.  And in 1950, it 

actually passed the Hobbs Act. 

Between those bookends, it passed the 

APA, did not subject the APA to an -- a -- a 

repose-based statute of limitations, and it 

passed 2401 two years later.  So we think that 

necessarily must be an intentional choice that 

APA claims are not subject to the type of repose

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --

but repose is a little bit different in this

 context.  I mean, you're talking about sort of 

establishing the ground rules for how a 

particular regulatory regime is going to 

operate, and, you know, you've got six years to 

do that. And, you know, you often see trade and 

other associations bringing fundamental 

challenges to the, you know, structure of the 

market or -- or the -- or the -- or the agency. 

And under your system, those -- that 

sort of challenge as to how everything is 

structured are going to be -- could be -- are 

going to be brought 10 years later, 20 years 

later. 

And -- and it seems to me that you 

sort of have to create the universe, you know, 

repeatedly, as opposed to just taking those are 

the ground rules and here's how -- how they're 

going to work. 

MR. WEIR: So we think challenges to

already in the as-applied context.  You can

always have an as-applied challenge.  Those

 happen to broad sets of regulations already. 

And so we don't see that really as an issue.

 And -- and -- and there -- I just want 

to be clear there's no incentive to challenge

 valid regulations or anything like that.  We're

 talking about challenges only to regulations

 that presumably have some defects, and those are 

exactly the type of challenges that Congress 

would want people to bring.  That's why it 

passed the APA. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does, 

like, stare decisis and rules like that, how do 

they work under this regime?  You have, you 

know, presumably fundamental challenges.  The 

new regulatory regime when it starts up and they 

get decisions and maybe they, you know, force 

the agency to change things. 

And then every time somebody brings a 

new facial challenge, they basically have to 

litigate that same question over again? 

MR. WEIR: So I -- I'm not sure stare 

decisis would apply unless it was an 

interpretation of this Court, of course.  But, 

in the lower courts --

 MR. WEIR: So -- so -- so -- the --

the cert stage that parties like Corner Post who 

are harmed for the first time more than six

 years after a regulation is issued are 

relatively uncommon.  That's the government's 

position.  And we think there's a reason why. 

Vast swaths of the regulatory state 

are already carved out by repose-based statutes, 

the 29 that the -- that the government cites. 

So those wouldn't even be subject to -- to -- to 

-- to this Court's decision here. They're 

already time-barred.  They're -- they're out. 

But even what's left for the APA, for 

APA claims, the vast majority of the country is 

already time-barred from bringing challenges to 

old regulations under the APA.  The only ones 

that have those -- that have the ability to 

bring those challenges are those who are harmed

 precedent that would bar you, as a matter of

 stare decisis, that would be a winner on the

 merits.  You'd lose.  You just -- you'd have a

 timely claim, but you'd lose, is that right?

 MR. WEIR: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And the government 

may be able to use non-mutual collateral 

estoppel or some other res judicata principle to 

say the matter is decided effectively against 

you anyway, right? 

MR. WEIR: That's correct. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So we're just 

talking about the timing of the suit. 

And then you -- you mentioned that 

nobody contests that as-applied challenges could 

go forward.  But how could that be?  I mean, if 

you lose, why wouldn't as-applied challenges 

also be barred because they too accrued back 

when -- if the accrual rule turns on the 

adoption of the rule, that would seem to bar all 

future claims, whether as-applied or facial. 

MR. WEIR: Well, certainly, that's 

possible.  The lower court precedent now, I'm 

not sure this Court's addressed -- directly 

addressed it --

JUSTICE GORSUCH: I understand lower

 court precedent has distinguished between the

 two, but they haven't discussed what "accrual"

 means and how -- how that word might be a

 chameleon and differ between as-applied and

 facial challenges.

 And if -- and if you were to lose and 

we were to hold "accrual" means the time of the

 adoption of the rule, it would seem to upset and 

undermine all of those decisions too, wouldn't 

it? 

MR. WEIR: I think I agree with that. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And then I 

have --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Weir, how could 

that be because --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm sorry.  I just 

have one -- one more question, and -- and -- and 

this is the last sentence of 702, which the 

government draws our attention to, and it says 

that "nothing herein" shall -- "affects other 

limitations on judicial review."  And I didn't 

see your response to that argument.  Do you 

understand what I'm getting at?

Official 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Can you -- can you 

give me your thoughts on that?

 MR. WEIR: I -- I can.  So -- so two 

-- two responses. First, this Court already

 dealt with that issue in Darby versus Cisneros.

 What happened in 1976 is Congress waived

 sovereign immunity and -- under 702, and what

 Congress wanted to do was make clear that that

 waiver did not affect any other limitation on 

judicial review that already existed.  So it's 

the -- the -- the waiver of sovereign immunity 

that's not affecting anything else. 

But even on its own terms, on the 

government's own terms, we think that argument 

doesn't work because all accrual-based statutes 

necessarily depend on the underlying cause of 

action.  So they work together.  So 702 -- so 

applying 702 in the way we think it should be 

applied is merely an application of 2401. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So you're saying, in 

other words, that your view -- I -- I just want 

to make sure I understand it -- doesn't affect 

any other limitation; it just interprets the 

word "accrual"? 

MR. WEIR: That's correct.

dealt with that in Darby versus Cisneros. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If -- if I could go 

back, Mr. Weir, to what you suggested about 

accrual would operate the same way in an action 

where there was an as-applied defense in an 

enforcement action, you know, it -- it -- I 

don't think it could.  2401(a) just talks about 

civil actions commenced against the United 

States.  It has no application to -- to -- to 

places where there's an enforcement action and 

this functions as a defense. 

MR. WEIR: So there are different 

types of contexts for as-applied.  If -- if --

if you are denied a permit, for example, you 

usually take that to court in the -- in federal

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

MR. WEIR: I just want to -- I just 

want to point out what the government is asking

a carveout for how general accrual rules have 

had -- have worked since the 1830s. It's asking 

for a carveout for how this Court has actually 

interpreted the phrase "first accrues" from 

Gabelli.  It's actually asking for a carveout of 

how this Court has applied 2401 in the past. 

We think Crown Coat supports us, but 

the Court had applied 2401's predecessors in the 

1900s. The Chamber brief outlines several 

examples where -- where -- where "first accrues"

 And -- and so what the government is 

asking for is a special rule just for it.  And 

this Court rejected the special -- that exact 

same argument in the Franconia case when it was

 leading --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But what do you do 

with the "first" in the actual statute? I mean, 

you seem to be asking us to read the statute as 

if it says a complaint is barred from the time 

in which the plaintiff is first aggrieved.  But 

that's not what it says. 

So how is it that every new company 

that is created in the aftermath of the creation 

of a rule can claim that this is the first time 

that the cause of action has arisen under the 

APA? 

MR. WEIR: Because, under 

accrual-based statutes, the -- the -- the -- the 

-- the claim is plaintiff-specific.  So, if you 

look at, like, the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  But 

you're just assuming away the question at the 

beginning by saying this is an accrual-based 

statute.  What I'm suggesting is that it's not.

Just because it says the cause of action accrues

 doesn't make it an accrual-based statute in the 

way that you are interpreting, and I don't

 understand how it can be when it says "first

 accrues."

 MR. WEIR: So the way we interpret 

"first accrues" is that the first time you 

suffer a harm, that is when your statute of

 limitations starts running. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But that 

doesn't -- isn't that reading words into the 

statute in a way that doesn't make a whole lot 

of sense?  You're suggesting that this statute 

is the first time anybody is harmed by the 

United States, they have six years, anybody, for 

any reason. 

MR. WEIR: That's how 2401 reads and 

is applied.  And -- and to be clear, it applies 

to not just APA claims.  It applies to FOIA 

actions.  It applies to government decisions 

that are not -- that are not covered by Title 

VII. And the government's rule doesn't make 

sense in those contexts.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 Justice Thomas?

 Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The government says 

that late-arising objectors like Corner Post can 

get relief by petitioning for new rulemaking. 

Why isn't that sufficient for you? 

MR. WEIR: So we don't think that's a 

-- a -- a -- a -- a viable path to judicial 

review for a couple of reasons. 

First, the government gets to decide 

when it rules on a petition for rulemaking, and 

it can sit on it for years.  But even the 

government acknowledged I think in PDR Network 

that this is not a guaranteed path to judicial 

review. 

Typically, a denial of a petition for 

rulemaking gets very deferential review that

the government said that parties that can bring 

this type of claim are relatively uncommon, and 

we think that's because most parties are harmed

 the day a regulation is actually issued.

 And I think you also have vast -- vast

 swaths --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why wouldn't

 this be extraordinarily destabilizing in the way 

that Justice Sotomayor suggested? I mean, we 

have settled rules that govern all sorts of 

industries, the healthcare industry, the finance 

industry, and people have adjusted themselves 

around them.  There are experts who understand 

how the law works and companies follow suit. 

If I understand you correctly, each 

new company that is created in an industry can 

suddenly bring a challenge that might risk or 

undermine valid -- invalidation of the entire 

basis of the industry, each new company, because 

you say each new company that's created can 

bring such a lawsuit. 

Now, whether or not it will succeed, I 

understand, but aren't you risking 

destabilization of the industry in this way?

 Circuit, and we would have seen them there in

possible because we had other doctrines that 

prevented, so, you know, for example, Chevron

because most regulations are -- are valid, 

there's -- there's no argument that they're 

unlawful.  So you would -- so you wouldn't see 

them. It's only the ones that have defects that 

you're going to see challenges to or potential 

defects.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN W. SNYDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. SNYDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

For decades, the courts of appeals 

have consistently recognized that the six-year 

statute of limitations on an APA claim accrues 

at the time of the challenged agency action, not 

the time when a particular plaintiff comes 

within the relevant statute's zone of interests. 

In asking this Court to reject that 

settled practice, Corner Post argues that the 

word "accrues" in Section 2401(a) invariably 

refers to the time at which a specific plaintiff

obtains a complete and present cause of action 

and that every newly formed entity therefore has 

six years to challenge any prior agency actions 

that affect its business or other interests,

 even if those actions occurred decades ago. 

Nothing in the APA or Section 2401(a) requires

 that destabilizing result.

 In Crown Coat Front Company, this

 Court explicitly rejected Corner Post's 

one-size-fits-all definition of "accrues," 

warning of the hazards of attempting to devise a 

single accrual rule for all purposes. 

Instead, the Court explained that to 

apply the general word "accrues," a court has to 

consider the particular type of claim at issue 

and how the practical purposes of a statute of 

limitations apply in that context. 

In conducting that necessary analysis, 

courts should give primary weight to evidence 

about the accrual rule that Congress itself has 

adopted when it has specifically focused on 

other claims of the same type. 

Doing so ensures that courts are not

 instead are faithfully following Congress's

 lead.

 Here, Congress's standard practice

 when it's focused on the time for challenging

 agency action has been to run the limitations 

period for that type of claim from the date of 

the agency action at issue.

 It would, therefore, reasonably have

 expected courts to follow the same approach when 

applying Section 2401(a)'s catch-all statute of 

limitations to claims under the APA, and because 

that's what the court of appeals did here, the 

decision below should be affirmed. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So when did the --

the claim accrue for this Petitioner? 

MR. SNYDER: So this Court has -- has 

said that a claim can accrue for different 

purposes or can -- can accrue for purposes of 

the statute of limitations at a point that's 

different from the point at which a plaintiff 

can bring suit. 

And so Corner Post could not have sued 

until some point after it was incorporated, it's 

not exactly clear when, but when it had formed

of limitations purposes, its claim accrued at 

the time the regulation was adopted in 2011.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Is that normal to 

have two different times? 

MR. SNYDER: So, in the context of

 administrative law challenges to agency action,

 that's absolutely the standard rule.  My -- my 

friend acknowledged that he can't point to 

another statute that doesn't treat accrual that 

way. 

In other contexts, in the contract 

context or the tort context, it's true that that 

sort of rule is unusual.  But, in the context of 

administrative law challenges, it's entirely 

typical, and it would be strange to say that the 

rule should apply at some other time -- at some 

other time here.

happy with it, so go home.

 553(e) of the APA itself.  In 555(e), it

 time.

 My friend --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --

MR. SNYDER: Well, I mean, we were --

we were talking in this case about Corner Post's

Corner Post is not relevant or, excuse me, is 

not regulated.  And so it's true that Corner 

Post can't assert these types of claims in an 

enforcement action, but that's because this rule 

doesn't apply to Corner Post. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't 

doubt that it has standing, right? 

MR. SNYDER: No, we don't doubt that 

it has standing.  And so it could have brought a

 well, Congress doesn't want people to sue, or 

somebody else had the chance to sue and you 

could have joined that trade association.

 MR. SNYDER: So, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

do want to push back a little bit on the idea

 that this injury is inflicted by the government. 

I think the reason that they cannot assert this 

claim in an enforcement proceeding is because 

the government is not applying this regulation 

to them directly. 

What their argument is, is that the 

government should be regulating someone else 

more aggressively. And so, in that context, 

it's true that they have fewer rights to 

judicial process when what they want is for the 

government to go and regulate someone else.  If 

they were the one regulated, they would have 

additional rights, and that's true in the 

context of dozens of other special statutory 

review provisions as well. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, counsel, I 

mean, you -- you mention the enforcement action 

possibility, but why would banks challenge this 

rule? They benefit from it.  So that avenue

Congress might want to pass statutes of repose 

with respect to rulemaking in a variety of 

contexts, as it did before the APA and it did 

after the APA with respect to specific statutory 

schemes. 

But the APA was passed 80 years ago as 

the background rule, the kind of minimum, the 

floor, and it was with a presumption of judicial

injury, that's when it starts, okay?

 Why wouldn't -- and I'm -- just as a

 matter of sense -- your -- your whole argument 

is it doesn't make sense to interpret it 

differently than those agency-specific statutes,

 the Hobbs Act and others.  But -- but is that

 so? Why wouldn't it be also perfectly rational 

for Congress to have adopted as the background 

rule the norm, the traditional common law rule? 

MR. SNYDER: So, Justice Gorsuch, I 

disagree that that's the traditional rule in 

this context.  Both before and after the 

adoption of the APA and Section --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm talking about 

the word "accrue." 

MR. SNYDER: And -- and that's what 

I'm talking about too. In Reading Company, this 

Court adopted an interpretation of the word 

"accrues" in which the -- the statute of 

limitations started to run before the plaintiff 

could recover on the claim. 

And then, in Crown Coat Front Company,

 statutes where that's done, and, I -- I again, I

 don't dispute that.  But the normal rule -- and

 I think you'd have to concede it -- is that the

 plaintiff's injury is the moment of accrual,

 that that's the normal rule.

 MR. SNYDER: So I think that is the

 norm --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And if we're looking 

at what the APA was trying to do as a -- a -- as 

a -- as a floor -- again, I'm not disputing that 

there are other examples -- but why would it be 

irrational to think that that's what Congress 

had in mind?  That's my question. 

MR. SNYDER: I -- so just as a point 

of clarification, in Reading Company, the 

statute just used the word "accrues." 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I understand. 

MR. SNYDER: And so it doesn't just 

have this single meaning.  Now --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  If you could answer 

my question. 

MR. SNYDER: So my friend pointed out 

that at the time the APA and Section 2401(a) 

were adopted, there were other statutes dealing 

with administrative review provisions, and those

 If you look at 21 U.S.C. 37 -- or 371

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  I got it.  I

 got it.  And -- and just flipping back to the 

question that we had earlier with your friend on

 the other side, if we were to interpret the word 

"accrue" to mean the moment of the agency's 

action, what's the consequence for as-applied 

challenges?  Put aside, again, enforcement 

because that's, you know, in a criminal 

proceeding or an enforcement proceeding.  Here, 

it's an APA challenge, and there's no 

distinction in the statutory text between 

as-applied and facial challenges. 

And I understand courts of appeals for 

years have said as-applied challenges may 

proceed without carefully looking at the word 

"accrue" either. 

MR. SNYDER: I -- so I think the 

difference is which action is being challenged. 

The reason you can raise a challenge in the 

as-applied context is that the final agency --

the final agency action that you're challenging 

is the agency action actually applying the

challenge less than six years after the final

 agency action occurred.

 The -- what you can't do is go back

 and challenge a regulation that was adopted

 decades ago.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Snyder, may -- may 

I ask, what is the coverage of this provision? 

In other words, you've noted that there are many 

statutes that deal with particular kinds of 

agency action.  So what's left over other than 

this regulation?  What's the world of things 

that this decision will matter to?  Is it small, 

is it medium-sized, is it large? What's in it? 

MR. SNYDER: So I think it is 

relatively large in the sense that the general 

APA cause of action applies to a -- a broad 

range of government claims.  Is that -- I'm not 

-- I don't know exactly how to quantify that, 

but I think it is true that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what kinds of 

claims?  From what kind of agencies?  What is 

not -- what are we -- what is not at issue here?

 precise answer on that.  I mean, I -- I can

 point you to the special statutory review

 provisions that we've identified in Footnote 4 

of our brief. Candidly, we got to a page-long 

footnote and stopped, so there are a lot of

 other special statutory review provisions that 

all use "accrual" in exactly the same way.

 I -- I mean, I think looking at a 

survey of this Court's cases and thinking about 

how often the Court encounters challenges in the 

context of an APA claim indicates that it's a 

pretty broad category of cases, but I don't have 

sort of precise contours I can draw. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But how much will 

it matter kind of in the real world?  Because, 

when you have a regulation that has some 

defects, it's probably going to be challenged 

sooner rather than later by someone.  And then, 

if -- if it's held invalid, it usually will get 

to this Court, which will provide, you know, a 

final answer on that question. 

So coming in more than six years later 

is not a -- typically a winning strategy for 

challenging a rule.  So just kind of real-world 

implications, picking up on Justice Kagan's

point. 

MR. SNYDER: So I -- I think one of

 the real-world implications to highlight is that 

this doesn't just apply in the context of

 regulations.  I mean, their rule would apply in

 the context of a permit issued to operate a dam. 

And on their theory, someone who travels out 

west for the first time to go see the snail

 darter can say, I -- I've never been here 

before, I've never been affected by this dam, 

and so I'm going to mount an APA challenge to 

that permit that was issued 20 years ago to 

allow the -- the dam to continue operating. 

I think that type of application 

extrapolated across the entire federal 

government and all of the final agency actions 

that the government engages in outside of the 

context of rulemaking, it's pretty hard to 

overstate the significance of allowing those 

challenges to be brought more than six years 

later. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then thinking 

about what Congress was getting at here, I'm not 

sure it was really getting at this issue at all 

because six years is an extremely long time to

 mean, I don't -- I don't know that they were

 thinking about this context.  We just have to 

apply the text as it is, but I -- I'm --

MR. SNYDER: I -- so -- I -- Justice 

Kavanaugh, I think I agree with you in the sense

 that 2401(a) is a catch-all statute of

 limitations.  Congress adopted it as a backstop. 

It erred on the side of caution in setting a 

lengthy six-year term. 

But, in understanding how to apply 

that catch-all statute of limitations to 

particular types of claims, I think the way to 

show fidelity to Congress's intent and 

Congress's expectations is to look at how 

Congress has approached accrual when it's dealt 

with similar claims of the same type. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But -- but 

Congress could easily -- this is an obvious 

point, but Congress could easily do that across 

the board for agency actions and certainly would 

do something shorter than six years if it did 

because repose has been thrown around here. 

The -- six years doesn't give you much 

repose to begin with if you're the government,

at least unless this Court has -- has ruled on

 the issue.

 MR. SNYDER: So I -- I mean, I think, 

of course, six years is better than six decades,

 which, I mean, that's not even a limit on my

 friend's rule.  So I -- I do think that six

 years meaningly -- meaningfully protects repose

 interests.

 And that lengthy term accounts, again, 

for the fact that this covers a broad range of 

claims.  Even outside the administrative law 

context, I mean, there are any number of other 

types of claims that are subject to Section 

2401.

from my position would say that's what Congress

 has chosen.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.

 MR. SNYDER: And to say that because 

Congress has chosen a petition for rulemaking

 process that is deferential, the Court should 

instead allow challenges to things that happened

 decades ago, I -- I don't think that really

 follows. 

And I do think that this case is a 

good illustration of the odd fit that this sort 

of claim is in a context brought a decade after. 

If you look at the complaint, it's full of 

references to, you know, cost data from 2013, 

2015, 2017, 2019.  But all of that data is 

completely irrelevant if they're right that --

the -- that they can go forward on a challenge 

to the rule as it was adopted in 2011. 

It makes far more sense to handle this 

kind of challenge in the context of a petition 

for rulemaking, where the agency can actually 

take account of experience with the rule and 

decide what makes sense going forward.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- suggests that the 

claim would fail on the merits, right? It's not 

-- it doesn't go to the issue of accrual.

 MR. SNYDER: I -- I -- I'm not -- I --

so my point is not that the claim would fail. I

 mean, they -- they have other arguments about

 the law.  We -- we think that -- those arguments

 would fail too.

 But my point about the intervening 

information is that they have thought that 

information is relevant to showing something 

about this rule, and yet, in the procedural 

mechanism they are using here, that information 

is completely irrelevant.  That suggests that 

maybe it's not the right procedural mechanism. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  When -- when I read 

your brief in opposition, I came away with the 

impression that this case would not have a broad 

practical effect.  You say on page 11 that --

that "it's relatively uncommon" -- "it's a 

relatively uncommon circumstance for a person 

who was not injured when the rule was 

promulgated to become injured at a later date." 

But then I got a very different 

message from your brief on the merits when you

to accrual under 2401(a) would substantially 

expand the class of potential challengers and 

thereby increase the burdens on agencies and

 courts."

 So what accounts for this different

 message?

 MR. SNYDER: So I think it's a -- a

the cert stage, the -- the point we were making

JUSTICE ALITO:  That we shouldn't take 

the case because it wasn't a big deal.  But

MR. SNYDER: Our point was that there 

aren't a lot of -- of plaintiffs in Petitioner's 

position as compared to plaintiffs who can bring 

the challenge. I think that is empirically a 

correct statement. 

If you think about this case, for 

example, the challenge that was brought to 

Regulation II back in 2011 was brought on behalf 

of tens of thousands of merchants.

that the numbers are different, but my friend, 

as he said, is seeking exactly the same relief 

that those entities sought back in 2011. And

 so, from the government's perspective, allowing 

this exception, even though it's only going to 

benefit a relatively small number of plaintiffs,

 would have really far-reaching effects.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Snyder --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But 2401 -- 2401 is a 

very broad statute that applies to every civil 

action against the United States, and as I 

understand your argument, you want us to say 

that the term "accrue" means something different 

in different contexts. 

Have we ever said anything like that? 

MR. SNYDER: So I think the Court said 

basically that in Crown -- Crown Coat Front 

Company, interpreting 2401.  It said that 

"accrues" is a general word, that it's hazardous 

to try to give it one definition for all 

purposes and that instead you have to interpret 

it in -- in the light of the specific statute at 

issue.

 2401(b), which is the provision governing tort

 claims against the United States, that similarly

 uses the word "accrues," and the Court has 

acknowledged in that context that different

 claims are subject to different accrual rules.

 So, in United States versus Kubrick, 

the Court said that most tort claims against the

 United States accrue at the time of injury but 

that some accrue at the time the injury is 

discovered in the context of medical 

malpractice, for example. 

So the Court has acknowledged that 

"accrues" can lead to different accrual rules 

for different kinds of claims. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  An argument that Mr. 

Weir makes is that if this were all so 

destabilizing, as you suggest, we would have 

seen that already because there can always be 

enforcement actions in which a party can defend 

itself by saying that the rule is invalid. 

So why hasn't that -- what -- why is 

this so much more destabilizing than that sort 

of regime?

all, this applies in contexts where there aren't

going to be enforcement proceedings, so, for 

example, the permit context that I mentioned. 

His rule would apply in that context, and I 

think that alone would make it pretty

 destabilizing.

 But I also think it's just the case 

that there are far fewer enforcement actions

 than there are regulated entities, and so

 allowing every -- every new regulated entity to 

bring a facial challenge would significantly 

expand the number of claims that you would see. 

The other -- the other point that my 

friend has made about why you shouldn't think 

this is going to lead to bad results is that 

there's been experience in the Sixth Circuit.  I 

do want to address that. 

I -- the Sixth Circuit, courts in the 

Sixth Circuit have not understood Herr to adopt 

the rule that my friend is arguing for, and the 

best evidence I can give you of that is that a 

newly incorporated pizzeria filed suit against 

Regulation II in Kentucky in 2022, and the 

court, applying Herr, said that claim, 

materially identical to this one, is untimely 

because Herr dealt with as-applied challenges as

 would look like. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And, Mr. --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Snyder --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Oh.  Go ahead.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- is -- is your

 rule of accrual completely disaggregated from 

injury?  Because you agree, right, as a matter 

of the APA and Article III that a plaintiff 

can't actually even bring a suit unless the 

plaintiff has been injured, right? 

MR. SNYDER: Yes.  That -- that's 

true. I mean, our accrual rule is the same 

accrual rule that Congress has called for in the 

context of the Hobbs Act. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I know, I know, I 

know, I know.  But we're talking about 2401. 

And -- and in Crown Point, the entitlement to 

payment didn't arise until at the point where we 

said it accrued.  So, I -- I -- you know, 

there's language in Crown Point that helps you, 

but on the actual facts of the case, that was 

when the injury was complete.

And so -- but -- but what I want to 

know is, would this be the only time for 

purposes of 2401, as -- as opposed to things 

like the Hobbs Act, where we would have 

interpreted "accrue" to be separate from injury?

 Like, what if the government delayed enforcement 

and there wasn't an injury yet, for example?

 MR. SNYDER: I -- so -- I -- I'm not 

aware of another case in which this Court has 

interpreted 2401(a) to sort of go in either 

direction.  I mean, in Crown Coat Front Company, 

the -- the accrual point was both the point of 

injury and the time of agency action.  So we're

its holding resolves it between those two. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mm-hmm. 

MR. SNYDER: As to a case where there 

was no -- where there was delayed enforcement, I 

mean, I think the whole idea of pre-enforcement 

review is that a -- a plaintiff can bring suit 

even -- even if they are not yet subject to 

enforcement actions.  And so I don't think that 

that would prevent someone from bringing a 

challenge when the regulation was first adopted. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But injury isn't

part of the calculus. It's really just

 finality?

 MR. SNYDER: So, yes, we -- we think 

that's true for the APA just as it's true for

 other --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And -- and doesn't

 it have to be that way?  Because I guess I'm

 trying to understand when the injury would occur 

under their theory with respect to the 

promulgation of the rule, right? I mean, the 

claim under an APA case in this way is that the 

rule was promulgated in an invalid way. 

So I'm trying to understand when the 

plaintiff would be injured if we're going to go 

with an injury theory. I don't even know when 

that would happen really. 

Can you speak to that? 

MR. SNYDER: I mean, I think they 

would say that they were injured for the first 

time when they felt the effects of the rule. So 

I think they would say, I mean, what the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But they came into

have said it's not the date they were

 incorporated.  They've said it's the day they 

opened the doors for business. I don't know why

 on their -- their understanding of the accrual 

rule it wouldn't be the day in which they --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But don't we have to 

pin that down if we're going to go with their

 rule? I mean, we've got to figure out when the 

clock starts.  So is it --

MR. SNYDER: I -- I'm with you.  I --

I mean, I -- I don't understand what the -- the 

right point would be for their rule. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And it's because 

their claim is about the promulgation of the 

rule, which happened before they existed, 

whereas an as-applied claim, as I understand 

your argument to be, would be that, you know, 

it's when the rule was applied to them. Then 

everybody has a clear date and we understand 

that the clock starts at that point. 

But this is a different kind of claim, 

so I don't understand when the injury would 

occur in this situation.

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I -- I'm having a 

little trouble understanding your answer, but 

probably I'm -- I'm not understanding it 

correctly.  Is it your argument that a facial 

challenge to a statute or a rule always accrues 

at the time of the adoption of the statute or 

rule and that once the statute of limitations 

has passed, no one can bring a facial challenge 

to that statute or rule? 

MR. SNYDER: So I -- I think the 

statutory context is different because there is 

no --

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Forget the 

statute.  A regulatory context. 

MR. SNYDER: So, in the regulatory 

context, yes.  Our position is, once the 

regulation has been adopted, there is a six-year 

period to challenge the final agency action

 there's -- there's not an opportunity to bring a

 facial challenge.  It can be challenged in the 

context of enforcement proceedings.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well,

 let's say there was a regulation that said that 

only men can be admitted to one of the military 

academies, and after the statute of limitations 

has run, a woman applies, wants to be admitted 

to a military academy, and you would say it's 

too late for -- for her to bring a facial 

challenge to that? 

MR. SNYDER: We would say that if she 

applies to the military academy and is denied 

admission, that at that point there is an 

application of the regulation to her and that 

she can raise substantive challenges to the 

regulation in that context. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the difference 

between that and the situation of Corner Post, 

other than the fact that they are indirectly 

hurt rather than being directly hurt?

 MR. SNYDER: Well, I -- I think more 

problematically, it's not they who would have to

 make that showing.  I mean, ordinarily, in an

 APA -- case, they would come forward and say we

 have concrete plans to accept debit cards as of

 today and so we can bring the challenge.  That's

 easy.

 The problem here is that we would have 

to come in and say they formed concrete plans to 

accept debit cards sometime before they opened 

their doors, but how do we know when that was? 

Again, I'm not saying that's 

impossible.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Can I just follow up

 on the Chief's question?  What if they were

 thinking about incorporating, but they haven't 

yet incorporated and they're still within the

 six-year period, and part of whether they 

incorporate and go into business depends on the

 structure of the industry and whether this rule 

is going to help? No standing, right?

 MR. SNYDER: I think that's right.  I 

mean, there -- there's no case law I can point

has applied their rule.  I mean, I think 

adopting their rule would open the Court up to 

all sorts of really thorny questions, however 

far down in the weeds they might be.  I think 

those questions just haven't been explored. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But those

2401 is the all-purpose statute of limitations.

 I'm just wondering, is your argument 

that we should interpret "accrue" this way

 because, in the administrative law context and 

because of the Hobbs Act and all these 

specialized statutes, a statute of repose-style

 accrual is -- makes more sense?  Would there be 

spillover effects in, say, you know, hey, I'm 

sure Congress would prefer all challenges to a 

statute to be adjudicated right away.  Would 

there be spillover effects? 

MR. SNYDER: I don't think there would 

be spillover effects.  You're right that a 

primary part of our argument, the primary part 

of our argument is the Hobbs Act and the other 

special statutory review -- review provisions 

establishing the standard rule in this context. 

And so it -- it applies sort of here as well. 

I -- we also have an argument about 

the final sentence of Section 702 that we 

haven't discussed. 

But the -- the last reason that I -- I 

don't think it would spill over to statutes is 

the challenges to statutes are -- are

 it's at least plausible to think that it would

 apply to all of those.  I don't know why it

 wouldn't on its logic.  And I -- again, I think

 that would be destabilizing.

           JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, number two, 

opposing counsel, in answering Justice Barrett, 

said that procedural challenges would not

 happen.  But, in your brief, you suggested they 

would. Could you tell me why their concession 

is not convincing to you? 

MR. SNYDER: Well, I mean, we said our 

brief -- we said it in our brief before they had 

made that concession.  They -- they hadn't said 

that until the reply brief.  And their complaint 

includes procedural challenges.  If you look at 

paragraphs 93 and 95 of their complaint, they 

include arguments that the agency failed to 

provide a reasoned explanation of Regulation II 

and that the record before the agency wasn't 

sufficient to support it. 

So I -- I'm glad that they're willing 

to give up procedural challenges, but we hadn't 

anticipated that before.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- Mr. Snyder, I 

want to emphasize that I'm -- I'm asking you a

 hypothetical question.  It's an "if" question.

 There is obviously another big 

challenge to the way courts review agency action

 before this Court.  Has the -- has the Justice 

Department and the agencies considered whether

 there is any interaction between these two

 challenges?  And, again, you -- you know, if 

Chevron were reinforced, were affirmed, if 

Chevron were reversed, how does that affect what 

you're talking about here? 

MR. SNYDER: So I want to be careful 

here. I mean, we, of course, have thought about 

it. I think what I'd say is that a decision for 

Petitioner here would magnify the effect of any 

other decisions changing the way that this Court 

or other courts have approached administrative 

law questions, because it would -- it -- it 

would potentially mean that those changes would 

then be applied retroactively to every 

regulation that an agency has adopted in the 

last, I don't know, 75 years or something.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One follow-up

 question on something you said earlier.  This is 

also about future effects on standing. 

You -- they ask in this suit to set

 aside the rule.  Your position, the Solicitor

 General's position, is that that can't be done

 under the APA. If you can't set aside the rule 

and you're not a regulated party, how is their 

injury redressable in this suit and why do they 

have standing? 

MR. SNYDER: So I -- I think our 

position has been that courts are only able to 

provide relief to the party before them and that 

ordinarily they --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  How would that be 

done in a circumstance like this? 

MR. SNYDER: So I -- I think -- and 

I'm -- I'm a -- little hesitant to say this --

but I think that in this circumstance, it's 

possible that the only way to provide this party 

relief would be vacatur.  I -- I'm not certain 

that that's right, but I think that's possible.

that's probably right, which was why I was

 you don't have the set-aside remedy, they 

probably don't have standing here.

 MR. SNYDER: So I -- I think the

 reason is that the -- the power that the Court 

has under the APA is to provide relief to the

 party before it, not more broadly.  And it's 

possible that in circumstances where the only

 way to give the party before the court relief is 

vacatur, that that would be consistent with 

traditional equitable considerations in a way 

that providing vacatur in other cases is not.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So just one 

question. The Chief mentioned the sort of

 common intuition that everybody gets their day 

in court, and I understand that and agree in a

 general sense. 

But there's also the intuition that

 the Court sometimes talks about the importance 

of finality, and it seems to me that in this 

particular scenario, finality principles should 

be playing a significant role. 

So can you just speak to -- this has 

come up a couple times, but why a new company 

that has been born into a particular regulatory 

environment, why should they be entitled to 

appear on the scene and potentially unsettle all 

of the long-established rules and expectations 

that govern all of the other companies that 

exist in that space? 

MR. SNYDER: So, of course, we don't 

think they should.  And -- and I think -- I 

mean, any statute of limitations is always 

balancing the interest in judicial review on the 

one hand and the interest in repose on the

other.

 And I think, in the context of

 administrative law challenges to agency action, 

both of those considerations sort of point in 

the direction of accrual at the time of agency 

action because the new entrant to the market

 knows what it's getting into.  So its interest

 in having its day in court is less than it might

 be in some other contexts. 

And on the other hand, because there 

are so many new entrants every day in a market, 

if you don't cut off the limitations period at 

that point, then the -- the time for bringing 

challenges would extend to decades.  And this 

Court has consistently rejected readings of 

limitations provisions that would allow suits to 

be brought decades after the thing that's being 

challenged occurred.

 points.  At the outset, the challenges that --

that my friend discussed are not procedural.

 Those are State Farm substantive challenges that

 we have in our complaint.  Those are available

 in as-applied contexts.  We think they will be

 available if -- if the Court sides with us.

 On the question of when an APA claim 

first accrues, we think the statute tells you. 

It says in the past tense or you're already 

being affected, you're already harmed.  We think 

that when you first are harmed by the regulation 

is when it starts. 

But even if it starts at imminence, we 

don't think it really matters that much.  This 

Court dealt with when an -- when an injury is 

imminent in Lujan.  It's an objective test.  You 

have to do more than just say I want to go 

somewhere.  And so we would say you can look at 

Lujan. 

But, in any event, the difference 

between when an injury is imminent and when it's 

actual is -- is typically very small, and six 

years into the future, it's really not going to 

matter when the statute of limitations runs.  We 

think it's a rare case where that's going to

 actually matter.

 As far as the -- the -- the concern

 about the APA being the only accrual-based 

statute in the regulatory context, we think that

 makes sense.  The APA is the background rule. 

You would only pass an agency-specific rule to

 deviate from that background, so there would be

 no real -- no real reason to pass an

 agency-specific rule. 

And, again, Congress knows exactly how 

to -- to -- to pass a repose-based statute.  It 

did it before the APA. It did it after the APA. 

We think that's an intentional choice, and it's 

done it many times since. 

And -- and the idea that because 

Congress has done it that way for some 

regulations that we should apply that rule to --

to -- to 2401(a) I think upsets basic 

interpretive principles.  When Congress makes 

different choices, it expects different rules. 

Finally, I -- I think the government 

is asking really for a special exception that 

would upset a lot of this Court's precedent. 

You would have to either undermine -- it would 

undermine the reasoning or flatly overrule the

statutes of limitations, including this Court's 

decision in Gabelli, where it interpreted this

 exact same language as -- as meaning what we say

 it means, and also undermine this Court's

 holding in Franconia, where the -- where the

 Court -- where the government asked for special

 rules under -- under, again, the exact same

 language in the "Big" Tucker Act under first 

accrues and -- and the government and -- and 

this Court said that it should apply the exact 

same as it does to private parties.

some problem here, this Court said in Rotkiske 

just five years ago it is Congress's job to 

change the text of this statute, not this
