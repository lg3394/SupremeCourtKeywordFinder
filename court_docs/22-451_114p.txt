 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 20 -- Case 22-451, Loper

 Bright Enterprises versus Raimondo.

 Mr. Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

This case well illustrates the 

real-world costs of Chevron, which do not fall 

exclusively on the Chevrons of the world but 

injure small businesses and individuals as well. 

Commercial fishing is hard.  Space 

onboard vehicle -- vessels is tight, and margins 

are tighter still.  Therefore, for the -- for 

the -- for my clients, having to carry federal 

observers on board is a burden, but having to 

pay their salaries is a crippling blow. 

Congress recognized as much by 

strictly limiting the circumstances in which 

domestic fishing vessels could be saddled with 

monitoring costs and capping them at 2 to 

3 percent of the value of the catch.  But the

agency here showed no such restraint, requiring 

monitoring on 50 percent of the trips at a cost 

of up to 20 percent of their annual returns. 

Nonetheless, the court below deferred to the 

agency because it viewed the statute as silent 

on the "who pays" question. 

There is no justification for giving 

the tie to the government or conjuring agency

 authority from silence.  Both the APA and 

constitutional avoidance principles call for de 

novo review, asking only what's the best reading 

of the statute.  Asking, instead, is the statute 

ambiguous is fundamentally misguided.  The whole 

point of statutory construction is to bring 

clarity, not to identify ambiguity. 

The government defends this practice 

not as the best reading of the APA but by 

invoking stare decisis.  That is doubly 

problematic. First, at issue here is only 

Chevron's methodology, which is entitled to 

reduced stare decisis effect.  We have no beef 

with Chevron's Clean Air Act holding, and we 

could not take issue with its APA holding 

because it failed to mention that statute. 

But, second, all the traditional stare

 decisis factors point in favor of overruling

 Chevron's methodology.  The doctrine is 

unworkable as its critical threshold question of

 ambiguity is hopelessly ambiguous.  It is also a 

-- a reliance-destroying doctrine because it

 facilitates agency flip-flopping.

 So the reality here is the Chevron

 two-step has to go and should be replaced with 

only one question: What is the best reading of 

the statute? 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Clement, you 

heard the government's, the General -- General's 

arguments with respect -- the use of mandamus as 

a basis for sort of deference. 

Could you comment on that?  Because my 

understanding of mandamus is that a duty has to 

be clear before it actually lies, but I'd like 

your comment on that. 

MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice 

Thomas. So I think mandamus is a critical 

recognition of the fact that, of course, 

Congress can limit the remedies available in 

particular circumstances, and that's the right 

way to understand the mandamus standard.

But that's quite different from 

telling the courts that they're to engage in 

statutory construction, as Congress clearly did 

in Section 706 of the APA, but then say there's 

a point at which you can't actually give us your 

best answer because you're deferring.

 And I think it's important from a

 separation of powers to under -- purpose to

 understand that it's not just remedies are 

different.  There's an accountability 

difference, because I suppose Congress tomorrow 

could decide that we're going to go back to a 

world where the only review of executive branch 

action is mandamus.  But then Congress would be 

fully responsible for that highly unpopular 

decision. 

But -- so that's the difference, I 

think, the fundamental difference from a 

separation-of-powers standpoint, between a 

limitation on remedies, where Congress does it 

specifically, and essentially telling the courts 

in the APA specifically you have the 

interpretive authority over statutes no less 

than constitutional issues but then overlaying a 

doctrine that says what we're doing is

 interpretation.

 And that's the critical thing about

 the interchange between Footnote 9 and Footnote

 11. Footnote 9 tells you as clearly as you can 

what you're doing in a Chevron case is statutory

 interpretation.  But then, in Footnote 11, it

 says, at a certain point, you stop doing

 statutory interpretation, even though you think

 there's a better answer, and you defer to a 

different branch of government.  And it's not 

the branch of government the Framers gave the 

interpretive authority to. It's the branch of 

government that the Framers gave the 

implementing authority. 

So I think, from that standpoint, 

Chevron is a fundamental egregiously wrong 

decision that just gets it wrong --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's -- this is 

MR. CLEMENT: -- on the basis of 

separation of powers. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's such a 

tension in this.  Interpretive authority, 

everybody seems to concede, means discretion. 

It means there's multiple meanings that you can

 the court -- if the statute uses "reasonable,"

 that Congress is delegating the definition of 

"reasonable" to the agency, and the agency is 

deciding what is reasonable within some outer 

limit either set within the statute or -- or

 within the law. 

But the point is that I don't -- it --

it -- it -- it's great rhetoric, Mr. Clement, 

but we do delegate, we have recognized 

delegations to agencies from the beginning of 

the founding of interpretation.  And so I -- I 

-- I'm --- I'm at a loss to understand where the 

argument comes from. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, let me try to 

clarify.  I think there is a difference between 

recognizing discretion and recognizing 

delegation.  There are certain statutory terms, 

as you yourself point out, that have -- that --

that, properly construed by the courts 

definitively, would give the agency a realm of 

discretion in which to operate. 

But there are other terms in which it

is really a binary question.  And the problem, 

the fundamental failing of Chevron is it doesn't 

do a good job of distinguishing between the two.

 And the best example is Brand X.

 Broadband communications are either an 

information service or they are a 

telecommunication service. It might be hard to 

figure out which one, but they can't be one on a

 Tuesday and the next on a Thursday. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a 

minute.  That's -- that's --

MR. CLEMENT: It's a binary question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that -- it may 

be binary to you, but I do know that with the 

development of technology and with the 

development of how that is implemented in terms 

of transmission and the Internet, that over time 

that's going to change.

very little that, outside, once those ships

 leave, that people -- that the U.S. Government

 can do to them, and the other was the -- I think 

it was the North Pacific area, but the point is 

that that doesn't mean that similar problems 

didn't arise later and that the broad words 

giving the Secretary the power to monitor and

 implement measures to ensure that its

 conservation goals were being followed wasn't 

given to the agency. 

Those are the facts of what we should 

be looking at, in my judgment, is, is -- is this 

measure commensurate with what drove the similar 

measure, not identical, in the other two 

examples and the agency should have first crack 

at that. 

MR. CLEMENT: So I disagree --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If they're not 

similar, the Court will look at it and say your 

decision was arbitrary and capricious. If they 

are similar, we might say, okay, this is all 

right. I don't know the answer to that because

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which is that

 things change on the ground --

MR. CLEMENT: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and a 

definition you give today may not hold up to new

 facts.

 MR. CLEMENT: So facts do change on

 the ground.  That is part of the problem with

 Chevron and Brand X. If there's a difficulty in 

classifying broadband today, the difficulty is 

that the statute was last passed in 1996, so 

figuring out whether 2023 broadband is a 1996 

information service or a 1996 telecommunication 

service is a granddaddy of a problem, but it 

does have a binary answer.  It's one or the 

other. 

Now, bringing it home to this statute, 

what I would say is, if you do the Chevron 

ambiguity test, you find a word like 

"appropriate" in the statute or maybe for some 

people "carry," though I think that one's pretty 

clear, and you say that word is ambiguous, so 

I'm going to go to step two. That's what the 

court below did. 

But, if you look at the statute as a

whole and if you looked at it the way you would 

in any other context, I think what you would see 

is this is a classic case for

 exclusius/inclusius -- I forget the exact Latin

 phrase -- but the point is you have a situation

 where, in the most commercially well-heeled 

fishery in the country, Congress did two things. 

It said you may, not must, have monitors paid

 for by the industry.  But you must, if you do 

that, cap the fees at 2 to 3 percent of the 

value of the catch. 

Now a Congress that did that with the 

most well-heeled fishery in the nation I do not 

think possibly conveyed the authority to the 

agency to say with a much different fishery in 

the Atlantic, where it's small businesspeople, 

we're going to let you do effectively the same 

thing, but we are going to let you do it to the 

tune of 20 percent of their annual returns. 

I think, if you strip away Chevron, 

this is a fairly easy case where you just say, 

wow, Congress had this question in mind in one 

place or, actually, three places to be specific, 

and with every domestic fishery, they only gave 

it in two instances, and in both instances, they

is is it's a recognition that in certain cases

 you apply all those tools and the conclusion you 

come up with is Congress hasn't spoken to this

 issue. And if you had no other option, you're a 

court, there's a case before you, you try as 

hard as you can, even though you know you're

 basically on your own.

 But, with -- when Chevron comes in,

 when there is an agency, what Chevron says is 

now there are two possible decision-makers, 

there's the agency and there's the court, and 

what we think is that Congress would have 

preferred the agency to resolve this question 

when congressional direction has -- cannot be 

found because of the agency's expertise, because 

of the agency's experience, because the agency 

understands how this question fits within the 

statutory scheme. 

So it's not a question of the court 

couldn't do it.  It's a question of, once 

congressional direction can't be found, who does 

Congress want to do it.

did believe it, I would say at that point let's 

give the tie to the citizen. Let's not give the 

tie to the agency.

 And I think it's important --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  See, I don't think

 it's like what we would do; you would give the 

tie to the citizen and I would give the tie to

 the agency.  Chevron is about what Congress 

wants. 

And you can call it fictional all you 

want, but we have lots of presumptions that 

operate with respect to statutory 

interpretation, and this is just one of them. 

It's just saying Congress understands as well as 

anybody different institutional's comparative 

attributes and comparative virtues, and it does 

not want courts making -- you can -- I mean, 

it's law, but it's policy-laden judgments 

once -- once Congress's direction can't be 

found. 

MR. CLEMENT: So, Justice Kagan, if 

we're going to talk about what Congress wants, 

we probably should at least avert to the fact 

that we do have an amicus brief in this case

of the case, and it certainly --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If it doesn't want

 Chevron, it has total control over Chevron.  It 

can reverse Chevron tomorrow with respect to any 

particular statute and with respect to statutes

 generally, and it hasn't.  For 40 years, it has

 acceded to Chevron.  Except in super-rare cases, 

it has basically said this is the background 

rule, it gives us a stable default rule from 

which to write statutes, and we've accepted 

that. 

MR. CLEMENT: So let me say three 

things about that. 

First of all, I'm not sure everybody 

in Congress wants to overrule Chevron because 

it's really -- it's --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, everybody in 

Congress doesn't want to do everything --

anything. 

MR. CLEMENT: But my point is it's

 I also think Justice Kavanaugh is 

right that even if Congress did it, the

 President would veto it.

 And I think the third problem is, and 

-- and fundamentally even more problematic, is

 if you get back to that fundamental premise of 

Chevron that when there's silence or ambiguity, 

we know the agency wanted to delegate to the 

agency. 

That is just fictional, and it's 

fictional in a particular way, which is it 

assumes that ambiguity is always a delegation. 

But ambiguity is not always a delegation.  And 

more often, what ambiguity is, I don't have 

enough votes in Congress to make it clear, so 

I'm going to leave it ambiguous, that's how 

we're going to get over the bicameralism and 

presentment hurdle, and then we'll give it to my 

friends in the agency and they'll take it from 

here. 

And that ends up with a phenomenon

would have thought that would have been true in 

the wake of the FTX debacle.  But it hasn't 

happened.  Why hasn't it happened?  Because 

there's an agency head out there that thinks 

that he already has the authority to address 

this uniquely 21st Century problem with a couple 

of statutes passed in the 1930s. 

And he's going to wave his wand and 

he's going to say the words "investment

we're not applying a fictional presumption but 

that Congress has told us, you know, we want 

courts to decide questions of law. 

The -- the Solicitor General in the 

last argument talked about how litigants will be 

lining up for cases that were decided under step 

two to seek to reopen challenges to the agency's 

interpretation. 

What do you have to say about the 

disruptive consequences of overruling? 

MR. CLEMENT: So I think the Solicitor 

General, with all due respect, will be saying 

the exact opposite if this Court overrules the 

decision and will be saying, no, you've got to 

look at it at the right level of generality.

What I would say is this Court has 

moved away dramatically from certain methods of

 interpretation, more dramatically than just we 

look at legislative history less now than we

 used to.  Implied causes of action, as far as I

 can tell, are dead.  But that didn't mean that

 every decision that was decided in the bad old 

days was overruled ipso facto.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But that's a little 

bit different because those implied causes of 

action, the Court was saying this is what the 

statute means, like Title IX implies a cause of 

action or whatever. 

This would be different because the 

Court would just be saying may not be the best, 

but the agency's interpretation is reasonable. 

So it doesn't settle it in the same way that 

maybe some of those old implied cause-of-action 

cases did. 

MR. CLEMENT: If you don't want there 

to be disruption, all you have to do is make the 

precise level-of-generality move that you 

alluded to, which is I would think in every one 

of these Chevron cases, the question is, is the 

agency's interpretation of the statute lawful?

And if the court has already held yes, it is

 lawful, I would think that would settle the

 matter.

 And as I say, in our brief, the only 

reason I have any doubt about that is because of

 Brand X. And Brand X is a huge embarrassment 

for the government and the government's friend.

 I looked through the bottom side amicus.  I 

counted 13 amicus briefs on the bottom side, 

only two of them cited Brand X, because, gosh, 

it would be nice for that decision to just go 

away, wouldn't it?  Wouldn't it? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sorry, Justice 

Thomas. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: But that absolutely 

makes clear that, you know, this is a 

reliance-destroying doctrine. And, frankly, if 

you said that Chevron is over and all of those 

step two cases that were decided are going to 

have stare decisis effect because of the level 

of generality point I made, you would be giving 

new stability to the law.  It would be improving 

stability. 

And that's an important distinction

 from Kisor.  In Kisor -- you know, the Kisor

 doctrine -- the Auer doctrine, rather, never had 

its Brand X moment where this Court made clear

 that the agency could flip 180 degrees.  And, 

indeed, in Kisor itself, it suggested the

 opposite.  But, here, with Chevron, we know this

 is a -- a reliance-destroying doctrine.

 Here's another thing to think about in

 terms of Kisor.  As I read the Court's decision, 

in addition to the fact that we know it doesn't 

directly speak to Chevron thanks to the Chief 

Justice, I also read it as all -- all it says is 

you need a special justification.  Well, I think 

we've offered you special justifications in 

droves and special justification beyond the 

decision being wrong.  And I don't know of a 

case where you would defer on stare decisis 

grounds when the relevant decision didn't cite 

the relevant statute at all. 

I mean, look, this would be a 

different world if Chevron went in and wrestled 

with Section 706 and said, despite all contrary 

textual indications, that it forecloses de novo 

review of statutes.  I suppose I'd have to be 

here making every single stare decisis argument.

 Now, of course, I don't want to be

 seen as running away from the stare decisis 

factors because I'm happy to walk through all of 

them because I think all of them cut in our

 favor. The decision is tremendously unworkable. 

Nobody knows what ambiguity is. Even my learned

 friend on the other side says there's no formula 

for it.  And that's an elaboration on what the 

government said the last time up here, which is 

that nobody knows what "ambiguity" means.  But 

that's just workability. 

Let's talk about reliance.  I talked 

about the Brand X problems, which are very 

serious problems.  And, like, I love the Brand X 

case because broadband regulation provides a 

perfect example of the flip-flop that can 

happen, but it's not my only example. There are 

amicus briefs that talk about the National Labor 

Relations Board flip-flopping on everything. 

Ask the Little Sisters about stability and 

reliance interests as their fate changes from 

administration to administration.  It is a -- it 

is a disaster.  And then you get to the

 real-world effects on citizens that Justice

 Gorsuch alluded to. 

But I'd like to emphasize its effect 

on Congress because, honestly, I think, when the

 Court was originally doing Chevron, it was 

looking only at a comparison between Article II 

and Article III and who's better at resolving

 these hard questions.  I think it got even that

 question wrong, but it failed to think about the 

-- the incentives it was giving the Article I 

branch. 

And that's what 40 years of experience 

has shown us, and 40 years of experience has 

shown us that it's virtually impossible to 

legislate on meaningful issues, major questions, 

if you will, because right -- because, right 

now, roughly half of the people in Congress at 

any given point are going to have their friends 

in the executive branch.  So their choice on a 

controversial issue is compromise and forge a 

long-term solution at the cost of maybe getting 

a primary challenger or, instead, just call up 

your buddy, who used to be your co-staffer, in 

the executive branch now and have him give 

everything on your wish list based on a broad

 And my friends asked for empirical

 evidence.  I think you just have to look at this

 Court's docket.  It's been one major rule after

 another.  It hasn't been one major statute after 

another. I would have thought Congress might 

have addressed student loan forgiveness if that

 were really such an important issue to one party

 in the -- in -- in -- in Congress. I would have 

thought maybe they would have fixed the -- the 

eviction moratorium.  I could go on and on on 

these issues.  They don't get addressed because 

Chevron makes it so easy for them not to tackle 

the hard issues and forge a permanent solution. 

My friends on the other side also talk 

about, you know, this is -- this is great 

because it leads to uniformity in the law. 

Well, I don't think that's an end in itself. 

Again, if it were up to me, if we -- if we think 

uniformity is so great, let's have uniformity 

and let's have the thumb on the scale on the 

side of the citizen. 

But the reality is the kind of 

uniformity that you get under Chevron is 

something only the government could love because

every court in the country has to agree on the

 current administration's view of a debatable

 statute.  You don't get the kind of uniformity 

that you actually want, which is a stable 

decision that says this is what the statute

 means.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Clement, can I ask

 you the same question I asked Mr. Martinez about

 why Chevron was initially popular?  People who 

were very sophisticated and had a deep 

understanding of how judges decide what a 

statute means and a deep understanding of how 

administrative agencies work thought that 

Chevron would be an improvement because it would 

take judges out of the business of making what 

were essentially policy decisions. 

Now were they wrong then?  And if they 

weren't wrong then, what, if anything, has 

changed since then? 

MR. CLEMENT: So, Justice Alito, I 

think they were partially right then.  So let me 

say what's changed and what hasn't changed, 

i.e., what the Court missed back in Chevron. 

What has changed is we've come a long 

way in statutory interpretation. And, the --

you know, if Chevron was a response to some of 

the excesses of the D.C. Circuit in the

 freewheeling days of the late '70s and the use 

of legislative history and, oh, by the way, the 

text of the statute appears in the margin of my 

opinion, and I'm not going to talk about it

 again because I'm off to the races, we now, I

 think, are all textualists.  The focus is much 

greater on the text of the statute. 

And once you recognize that, you 

recognize the problem with deferring at a 

certain point to the agencies.  And let's look 

at the track record of the agencies before this 

Court. If they are so expert, they should be 

able to persuade you in case after case that 

they're getting these statutes right.  By my 

count and by the Cato Institute in their -- in 

their amicus brief, since the Court last cited 

Chevron, the administration is batting about 300 

in these cases. 

So expertise is not all what it's 

cracked up to be.  And that's true even in the 

most complicated cases.  Look at the American 

Hospital Association's case.  I don't think 

you're going to find a statute that's more

you, Mr. Clement.

 The answer from Mr. Martinez on 

several questions about what happens when you, 

you know, get rid of Chevron in this case was

 Skidmore. And if Skidmore is going to occupy a 

more prominent role going forward, I -- I'd like

 to know exactly what your understanding of that

 principle is.

 MR. CLEMENT: So my understanding of 

Skidmore, consistent with Justice Kavanaugh's, 

is it's not actually a deference doctrine.  Call 

it a -- a doctrine of weight or persuasiveness. 

And then the beauty of -- of Skidmore, 

as I understand it -- I suppose the defect as 

well, Justice Scalia called it the totality of 

the circumstances -- but I think the Skidmore 

test allows you to consider the weight of the 

agency's views but then consider is it something 

they came up with like right after the statute 

was passed, so it actually sheds light on the 

original public meaning of the statute, or is it 

something that they didn't adopt for 20 years 

later, or did they adopt one policy right after 

the statute was passed and actually flip it over 

20 years later?

All of that is something that Skidmore

 can account for that Chevron has never been

 caused to account for. Now you can modify it, 

you know, à la Kisor and try to add all of that 

to it, but I do think that the Chevron --

 experiment has failed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's 

usually described as a deference doctrine. 

People talk about Skidmore deference. 

MR. CLEMENT: Yes, they do, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and that puzzled me a little bit.  And 

I went to the dictionary and I looked up 

"deference" and the most common definition is 

"yielding to the will of another." 

And I think, if that's the definition 

of -- of "deference," then you shouldn't apply 

Chevron -- Skidmore, rather -- in a way where 

you actually say:  All right, this is super 

close, and I think I have the right answer, but 

I'm going to yield to the position of the 

executive branch. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: That's never what 

Skidmore has been understood to mean or said. 

It -- it said that the persuasiveness of the 

government's interpretation depends upon the

you're right, we'll tell you you're right.  So 

the idea that Skidmore is going to be a backup, 

at -- once you get rid of Chevron, that Skidmore 

means anything other than nothing, Skidmore has 

always meant nothing.

Jackson, the earlier one, would beg to differ

 with you on that score.  He thought it was quite 

important. And I think, you know, if you look 

at the Skidmore case itself, I mean, it took 

into account the Wage and Hour Division's view

 of waiting time and, ironically enough in that

 case, said, you know, we can't have a

 bright-line test one way or another because the 

agency has looked at this and thought a lot of 

time, and it's really going to be more 

fact-dependent than that and we can take that 

into account. 

I think, in some of these situations, 

you are going to be able to look at the agency's 

expertise and make a judgment that this is in 

their bailiwick.  They've really made some 

pretty good points.  But, in other contexts, 

you're going to see that what the agency wants 

you to defer to is its own view that lands it in 

this case, we ran out of money and it sure would 

be nice if we could just impose this fine and 

continue to monitor these people at a 50 percent 

rate by making them pay for it instead of us 

having to pay for it.

 Justice Thomas?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess what I'm 

struck by, Mr. Clement, and -- and -- and this 

follows from this Skidmore thing, because 

Skidmore is not a doctrine of humility, but 

Chevron is. 

Chevron is a doctrine that says, you 

know, we recognize that there are some places 

where congressional direction has run out, and 

we think Congress would have wanted the agency 

to do something rather than the courts. 

We accept that because that's the best 

reading of Congress and also because we know in 

our heart of hearts that Congress -- that 

agencies know things that courts do not.  And 

that's the basis of Chevron. 

And then you take that doctrine of 

humility and you put on top of it stare decisis, 

another doctrine of humility, which is to

 unless there's an -- a special justification. 

Here, Kisor said it's even more than that, 

there's even more reason not to reverse 

something because there have been 70 Supreme

 Court decisions relying on Chevron, because

 there have been 17,000 lower court decisions

 relying on Chevron.

 And you're saying blow up one doctrine 

of humility, blow up another doctrine of 

humility, and then expect anybody to think that 

the courts are acting like courts. 

MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Your 

Honor, this Court has on multiple occasions 

corrected its own errors when it comes to 

statutory interpretation, how to deal with 

qualified immunity, implied causes of action. 

In the Encino Motor cases -- Motor 

case, there was a canon of construction that 

said exemptions to FLSA provisions should be 

construed narrowly.  This Court overruled that 

and said that should have no role to play in 

interpreting the FLSA. It didn't run through 

the stare decisis factors. 

So I think there is, I don't know

whether you call it humility or just clarity, 

but when the question is judicial methodology, I

 think it's very weird to ask Congress to fix

 your problems for you. I don't think you 

actually want to invite, in all candor, that 

particular fox into your hen -- henhouse and 

tell you how to go about interpreting statutes 

or how to go about dealing with qualified

 immunity defenses. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But Kisor, five 

Justices, a majority of this Court, made clear 

that Auer deference was subject to normal 

judicial -- normal principles of stare decisis. 

And to the extent that there was a ratchet up or 

a ratchet down, it ratcheted them up because it 

understood that that deference decision 

supported, was the basis for tens, hundreds, 

thousands of other decisions. 

MR. CLEMENT: So I'm going to be at a 

disadvantage in debating what exactly Kisor 

held, but the way I read Kisor is it said that 

you need a special justification beyond the 

decision being wrong.  I think we've given you 

that in spades. 

Kisor did not, with all due respect,

it didn't wrestle with Gaudin in the opinion. 

So I think I can -- I can reconcile all your law

 by saying:  All right, when it's a procedural

 rule or a court-made rule of interpretation,

 maybe we look to some of the same factors, but 

they don't apply with the same weight as they 

would if it were a substantive result.

 And that does make sense because, at 

least under our view of the world, when you move 

on from a bad methodology, you don't overturn 

all those decisions, those substantive 

decisions.  They still stay there. 

So Section 1982 still has an implied 

cause of action.  Section 1981 still has a cause 

of action.  I could go on and on.  Those cases 

don't get overturned.

 MR. CLEMENT: No.  I -- look, I -- I 

do think that, you know, reconsidering

 judicial humility.  And I do think, if you look 

at Justice Scalia's Perez opinion, the mortgage 

banker cases, one of the things he said there 

most clearly but he said all along was our 

decision in Chevron was completely heedless of 

Section 706 of the APA.

 contemporaneous and consistent interpretations 

as evidence of the proper original meaning of 

the statute because that's kind of common sense 

in statutory interpretation more generally, that

 if an interpretation was contemporaneous and 

consistent, it's more likely to be correct.

 So that's respect, but the word

 "deference" I wouldn't have -- wouldn't have

 used there. 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I think you have 

that exactly right.  And one of the virtues of 

looking at Skidmore that way is it is consistent 

with a principle that this Court articulated in 

the Christopher against SmithKline Beecham case, 

which is sometimes the industry is the one with 

a consistent, long-term understanding of the 

statute that goes all the way back and sheds 

light on the original public meaning. 

And it seems to me Skidmore allows you 

to say, if the industry says -- has taken a 

position that's consistent from the beginning 

and the agency flips 25 years into the 

enterprise, Skidmore gives you the tools for 

saying, all right, agency, you're going to lose 

that case, Chevron doesn't.

position every four years, that's going to still 

get Chevron deference, but Skidmore, with the

 respect to that interpretation, would drop out 

because it's not been a consistent and

 contemporaneous -- consistent from the

 contemporaneous understanding of the statute. 

MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. 

Flip-flopping is a huge Skidmore minus and it's 

a matter of indifference -- or, actually, if you 

look at some of the things that Justice Scalia 

said in the beginning, when he was enthusiastic 

about the doctrine, the fact -- he viewed the 

fact that agencies could flip-flop under Chevron 

as being an affirmative virtue. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Then Justice Kagan 

raises an important point about judicial 

restraint or humility in terms of Chevron, and 

that -- that's an important concern for any 

judge. 

I think the flip side, why this is 

hard, the other concern for any judge is 

abdication to the executive branch running

Constitution or, in this case, by Congress.

 So I think we've got to find the --

that's -- that's why it's hard, find the right

 balance between restraint and letting the

 executive get away with too much.

 On that front, do you -- there was

 questions earlier, do judges really rely on 

Chevron? You want to speak to that? 

MR. CLEMENT: No, I'd love to speak to 

that, because I think that's an important 

consideration. I mean, one of the premises of 

one of Justice Kagan's questions in the first 

argument was that, you know, you rarely get to 

Chevron step two, but there are statistics on 

this. 

There is a -- you know, the most 

exhaustive survey of over a thousand cases by 

Barnett and Walker we cited on page 33 of the 

blue brief.  It found that courts were reaching 

70 -- were reaching step two in 70 percent of 

the cases, 70 percent of the cases.

think, well, things have gotten better because 

that was a longitudinal study over a number of

years. You might think, well, things are

 getting a lot better because we've signaled that

 Chevron is on sort of life support.  But the 

Cato ran the numbers for, like, 20 -- 2020 and

 2021, and it's down to 60 percent.  But it's

 still well over half the time your average judge 

in the court of appeals is getting to step two, 

and Judge Kethledge, you know, he hasn't updated 

that speech, but, as far as I know, Judge 

Kethledge still hasn't gotten to step two once. 

And, you know, that's an -- that's --

that's an unsettlement in the law, that's a 

disconnect in the law that is very hard to get 

your fingers around.  Like, at least if, you 

know, one circuit says the statute means X and 

another circuit says Y, everybody can see that, 

cert can be granted, this Court can resolve the 

case. 

But, if courts are deciding some cases 

step one, some cases step two, in ways that are 

radically different, I don't even know how you 

really unearth that.  So I think that's another 

huge problem with this.

says, we should go ahead and decide the issue, 

the statutory issue in this case. Can you just

 speak very briefly to why?

 MR. CLEMENT: Very briefly, because I 

think it would give a great illustration of how

 to do plain old-fashioned statutory 

construction. It would also be a useful object 

lesson in how far very good judges get astray by 

applying Chevron, because another problem with 

Chevron -- I'll still try to be brief -- it 

tends to focus on one or two terms and asks 

whether they're ambiguous, and you lose the 

context of the statute. 

I think, if you have the context of 

the statute and the fact that the only other 

places they put these kind of fees on domestic 

fisheries, they put a -- a serious cap, and then 

they did it only for the most well-heeled 

fisheries or in special circumstances, this is 

an easy case doing good old-fashioned --

JUSTICE BARRETT: So we have a host of 

canons, clear statement rules, some of which are 

constitutionally inspired, and when I asked the

 Solicitor General in the last argument about

 whether Chevron should be thought -- thought of 

as part of that package, she said that Chevron 

kind of stood distinct, that Chevron was unique.

 Can you address that? 

MR. CLEMENT: I think she's right 

about that.  I think it -- it sits out there 

like an island, and that's part of the reason to 

overrule it.  And I think all the other canons 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: -- I think all the other 

canons that I can think of are fully consistent 

with de novo statutory interpretation.  I might 

be missing one, but the ones I think of is, when 

you're doing de novo statutory construction, you 

take into account all of those canons. 

Chevron's the only one I know that says that at 

a certain point you just stop the de novo stuff 

and you sort of surrender, even under 

circumstances where, if the agency weren't a

 Chevron does that.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  One last question.

 You said -- you know, you pointed out that on 

our docket we've had multiple cases in which the

 Major Questions Doctrine has come up. Do you

 think that overruling Chevron is going to solve 

that problem? Because, in a lot of those cases, 

the agency has hung its hat on words like 

"appropriate," you know, on the kind of language 

which I think -- and you can tell me if you 

disagree about this -- I think you agree that 

when a statute uses a word that leaves room for 

discretion, like "appropriate," "feasible," 

"reasonable," that that is a delegation of 

authority to the agency. 

So don't you think agencies will still 

continue to rely on words like that in ways that 

might not, you know, limit our emergency docket? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I'm not so naive to 

say that overruling Chevron is going to solve 

all the problems with the emergency docket, but 

it is going to make it a lot better because, 

sure, there are some places where they use 

"appropriate" or they try to use "modify," which

times this morning, Petitioners have sought to 

characterize this case as presenting a 

fundamental question of the separation of powers

 and a test of Article III:  Will courts continue 

to say what the law is?

 But I think, stepping back, I want to 

make sure that what doesn't get lost in the

 shuffle is that Petitioners have made an

 important concession that I think illustrates 

that the issue here is actually far narrower and 

that their attacks on Chevron lack merit and are 

unnecessary. 

The concession is this:  Petitioners 

acknowledge that Congress can expressly delegate 

to agencies the authority to define statutory 

terms and fill gaps.  Imagine, for example, if 

the statute said, in Chevron, "stationary 

source" as defined by the Administrator.  I take 

both Petitioners to give that up and recognize 

that is a delegation and courts should respect 

that. 

The role of the court in that 

circumstance is to make sure that the agency has 

followed the proper procedures and stayed what

authority to agencies, and the executive has

 core Article II authority to fill in those gaps.

 That's a core exercise of the executive power. 

And then the Article III courts are just 

fulfilling their judicial role when they give 

effect to what Congress has done in its choice 

to rely on the agency in that regard. 

But I think what all of this shows is 

that the constitutional attacks on Chevron and 

the suggestion that it's egregiously wrong in 

that regard lack merit because there is no 

constitutional distinction between that kind of 

express delegation and the delegations 

recognized in Chevron. 

If Congress can expressly vest an 

agency with authority to interpret the law 

through an express delegation, then it can do 

the same thing implicitly, especially in a world 

where Congress has to provide the agency with 

the express authority to carry the statute into 

operation with the force and effect of law. 

Now we can debate, of course, whether

Chevron drew the right line in identifying 

exactly when these delegations have occurred. I

 think the Court got that right for all of the

 reasons I've tried to explain this morning.  But

 I -- I think it's important to recognize that 

that debate doesn't have a constitutional 

dimension to it that falls out of the equation.

 Instead, it's just a question of whether the 

Court drew the right line in identifying when a 

delegation has occurred. 

And if you recognize that, then I 

think what's left over are the practical 

concerns that have been raised about Chevron. 

And I don't want to diminish the force of the 

concerns that some members of the Court have 

articulated, but I also think that those 

concerns are manageable.  The Court could do in 

this case what it did in Kisor.  It could 

clarify and articulate the limits of Chevron 

deference without taking the drastic step of 

upending decades of settled precedent. 

And I think that's the right thing to 

do here.  You know, my -- my friends in their 

briefs both said judges should aspire to be like 

umpires, calling balls and strikes.  But stare

decisis is part of the rules of the game here

 too. And in this case, I think all of the stare

 decisis factors counsel in favor of retaining

 Chevron.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  How do you -- how do

 we discern statutory -- delegation from

 statutory silence?

           GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, Justice Thomas, 

I think that it would be wrong to suggest that 

you can neatly categorize cases as those 

involving silence and those involving ambiguity. 

And -- and the reason for that -- I recognize 

that -- that Chevron itself used both of those 

terms, but I think that the Court was just 

trying to be comprehensive about those kinds of 

circumstance where Congress hasn't itself 

directly resolved an issue. 

There's never going to be total 

silence in a statute. At the very least, the 

agency is going to have to be able to point to 

the express delegation of rulemaking authority, 

the directive from Congress to put the statute 

into effect with the force of law.  So that will 

always be at least a baseline in this context.

And then, in the mine-run case, you'll be able

 to point to any number of additional features of 

a statute that help to signal the agency's

 authority.

 And, actually, this case is the 

perfect example because my friend said that the

 Magnuson-Stevens Act here is silent on the issue 

of whether the industry can be required to pay

 for monitors.  But we have four different 

provisions of the Act that we've pointed to that 

undergird the agency's authority. 

There's the provision that expressly 

says that the agency can require the vessels to 

carry the monitors.  Then there's the -- the 

definition of what a monitor is under the 

statute.  It can include a private third party. 

Then there's the penalty provision that says, in 

a circumstance where the vessel owner has 

contracted with a private third party and not 

paid, the agency can penalize.  And, finally, 

there's the residual authority to enact 

necessary and appropriate terms in these Fishery 

Management Plans.  So we don't think that this 

is a case about silence at all.

D.C. Circuit, it's true, in Loper Bright

 circumstances that trigger Chevron.  At the

 outset, I want to make perfectly clear that, of

 course, the statutory context and structure is 

one of the important tools of interpretation 

that a court should use at step one.

 So, if we are in a world where the

 Court can walk through those factors and

 ascertain that Congress spoke to the issue, let 

me just be very clear, we recognize the Court 

then should give effect to what Congress is 

saying. 

And if what you're suggesting then is 

that in a world where Congress hasn't actually 

spoken to the issue the Court should give no 

respect at all to the agency's interpretation, I 

disagree that that is faithfully implementing 

Congress's intent, because what Chevron 

recognized is, in a circumstance where Congress 

hasn't spoken to the issue, given the express 

grant of -- of adjudicatory or rulemaking 

authority to the agency, and necessarily 

recognize that the agency is going to have to 

fill the gap along the way, it is perfectly 

sensible to presume that Congress would want the 

agency to do it.

 contexts, you can look and say, Congress 

dictated it, there is a binary answer with 

respect to broadband or there's a binary answer

 with respect to how to define "stationary

 source."

 And what Chevron recognized and what I

 think is just absolutely true as a matter of the

 on-the-ground realities and how Congress

 legislates is that Congress doesn't actually 

decide all of these issues. 

What Chevron recognizes is that when 

Congress hasn't decided it and some follow-on 

person is going to have to fill in the gap and 

it's a question of whether it should be the 

courts or the agency, there is a presumption 

here that Congress intended it to be the agency 

but always subject to those guardrails about 

making sure the agency's construction is 

reasonable.

didn't address 706 and -- and how do you respond 

to that part of his argument?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So my theory 

for why Chevron didn't address 706 is because

 706 has never been understood at any time, at 

the time it was enacted or in any of the eight 

decades since, to have dictated a de novo 

standard of review for all statutory

 interpretation questions. 

So there was no inherent tension 

between Section 706 and Chevron. I think it's 

actually just further confirmation of what the 

APA's own history shows. 

As I was trying to explain in the 

first argument, you know, this is a situation 

where the Court has recognized that the APA 

wasn't meant to create dramatic changes, and it 

would have been a dramatic change, going from 

all of the deference principles that had been 

deployed, particularly in cases of ambiguity in 

the case law, including immediately leading up 

to the APA, to a de novo standard on a 

prospective basis going forward would have been 

a big change in the relationship of how judicial 

review occurs for agency action.

But no one mentioned that.  No one 

suggested at the time that that was the right 

way to interpret the APA. It's never how this

 Court has interpreted it.

 And I think this is an important 

point, Justice Barrett, in response to your

 questions about the APA.  You know, it -- it's 

not as though this has just been a one-off

 decision.  The Court has had any number of 

decisions, over 70, applying Chevron, and I 

think, in each and every one of those, it's 

important to recognize that there hasn't been 

this kind of inherent tension between the APA 

and Chevron itself, which just I think further 

shows the Court's own understanding of 

Section 706 is entitled to some weight here. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So I have a question 

about the relationship between Brand X and your 

suggestion that we "Kisorize" Chevron 

essentially. 

So I understand Brand X to say that a 

court must let go of its best interpretation of 

a statute if an agency advances an inferior but 

plausible one. But you told us that one way to 

handle this would be to emphasize Footnote 9 and

say what we said in the Kisor context -- context 

that, no, you know, use all the tools in the 

toolkit and come up with your best

 interpretation.

 So why wouldn't adopting your approach

 require us to essentially repudiate Brand X?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, if you 

understand Brand X to hold that the Court can 

think it has a best interpretation, it has 

figured out what Congress was saying about this 

issue and Congress spoke and nevertheless has to 

adopt some inferior agency interpretation, then 

that is inconsistent with our approach. 

We -- we don't read Brand X that way. 

I understand Brand X to be distinguishing 

between step one and step two holdings.  So, if 

there is a step one holding where, in fact, you 

know, the -- the Court has got it at the end of 

the day and recognizes that Congress spoke to 

the issue, there's no room under Brand X to let 

an agency come along after the fact and say the 

statute should be understood some different way. 

It's only in the circumstance where 

there was Chevron deference granted under step 

two, and part and parcel of that is recognizing

that that's because the statute was interpreted 

at the first time to not actually supply an 

answer dictated by Congress and instead to give

 the agency direction -- I'm sorry, discretion.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But could the Court 

have a best answer if it's a step two question? 

I mean, it seems to me that having a best answer

 suggests that you engaged in a question of

 statutory interpretation, came up with your best 

answer, and it might just be really hard. 

So sometimes, if a court outside of 

the agency context confronts a difficult 

question of statutory interpretation, it might 

say, look, I'm 90 percent confident or I'm 

95 percent confident, but, I mean, I -- I -- I 

think your reading of Brand X might depend on 

what the trigger for ambiguity is, right? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I -- I do 

think that it's kind of clearly demarcating the 

lines between step one and step two holdings. 

And so at least the -- the rules of the road are 

clear with respect to when an agency might have 

been granted discretion to revisit its prior 

conclusions.

 there's a way to read Brand X to say that even 

in a circumstance factoring into the equation

 the possibility that Congress meant to delegate 

to the agency that there is a better

 interpretation, a best interpretation that 

Congress actually resolved it, I just don't

 think you would ever get into the Brand X 

scenario because that sounds to me like a step

 one ruling. 

And I take the point that there is 

some inherent, you know, lack of precision in a 

term like "ambiguity."  That's not something 

that's uniquely created by Chevron.  Of course, 

there are ambiguity triggers in the laws and in 

all kinds of contexts. 

But it's also that kind of 

indeterminacy that might be worrying you is not 

anything that's cured by overruling Chevron 

because, as I was saying to Justice Kagan in the 

first argument, I think it will just open up a 

world where there is a lot of indeterminacy and 

inconsistency in how judges are applying the 

principles in a case of ambiguity.

 point out the experience of some of the states

 with Chevron.  Some states don't have Chevron,

 and other states have had something like Chevron

 but have eliminated it in recent years and 

decades, and their experience, they say, has 

shown that it's plenty workable in such a

 regime.

 So I just want to make -- make sure

 you can respond to that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So my 

understanding is about half the states still 

have something akin to a principle of deference. 

There might be some variance with respect to how 

much it looks like Chevron.  But I acknowledge 

that some states have abolished any form of 

deference to administrative agencies. 

I do think that there is a lot less 

concern at the state level about the lack of 

uniformity or consistency, so one of the values 

that Chevron implements and recognizes for why 

Congress would prefer for an agency to be able 

to set these rules and for the courts to respect 

that is the value in ensuring that there are 

uniform rules throughout the country.  And I 

don't think that that same experience exists at

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- did I 

understand you in response to a question from 

Justice Thomas to say that Chevron doesn't apply

 to constitutional questions? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  It's only a 

doctrine that applies in the context of 

statutory interpretation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know. 

But how you interpret statutes certainly can 

have an effect in raising particular First 

Amendment questions or otherwise. 

Does it apply in that situation? 

Department of Education has some rule.  This 

applies to, you know, all -- all schools, you 

know, and it doesn't -- it can apply to 

religious schools because this is how we

So is there Chevron deference there?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that if

 the -- a particular interpretation would create

 serious constitutional problems, then the 

doctrine of constitutional avoidance is one of 

the traditional tools that the Court can consult 

in order to understand whether Congress spoke to

 the issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and the 

agency says we don't think this causes 

particular constitutional problems.  That's our 

expertise about how we apply this provision, and 

given that, we think there's no free exercise 

problem. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, a court would 

not defer to that because this is all happening 

at step one.  I think that this is part of the 

process of the court determining whether 

Congress spoke to the issue.  And the court has 

been very clear that deference doesn't come in 

at all until you get to step two. 

So, for example, the agency's view 

that it deserves Chevron deference or, you know, 

its kind of take on one of those step one 

issues, it's not itself meritorious of getting

any deference at that stage of the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I do want to take 

another shot at trying to explain why I believe

 Petitioners are wrong to have characterized

 Chevron as resting on a fiction. And I think 

what they have tried to say is that this doesn't 

really reflect what Congress is intending. But

 I see three principal problems with that. 

The first is that I think that, 

actually, looking at it from a -- a matter of 

first principles, there is a lot of merit and 

weight to the recognition that in a situation of 

genuine ambiguity, there are good reasons for 

Congress to want to vest the expert agency with 

this kind of authority. 

It's the recognition that agencies, of 

necessity, are going to have to fill in the 

gaps, and many of these programs are complex, 

they're technical, they're going to require the 

agency to draw on its longstanding experience 

with a program and the expertise it's 

accumulated in working within that regulated 

industry in order to make a sensible regulation 

that also will encompass, I think, inherently

some policy considerations.

 Congress would know that the agency

 can run a centralized decision-making process in

 doing this.  Chevron only applies in

 circumstances where there is a sufficient level 

of formality in the agency's decision-making.

 That's usually notice-and-comment rulemaking, 

and that's a process where all comers can come 

in and tell the agency here are our views, 

here's what you should think about in terms of 

regulating --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that -- that 

-- that notice point is a -- very important, it 

seems to me, to your argument because the -- the 

rationality of a supposition that Congress would 

want to favor the government, rather than a 

supposition, equally rational, that it would 

want to favor individual liberty is made a 

little more weighty if you assume that the 

government's provided everybody a notice and 

opportunity to be heard. 

But often the government seeks 

deference for adjudications between individual 

parties and then apply that to everybody without 

notice to them, or deference for interpretive

formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings,

 is required.

 And so there are many circumstances in

 which the government does seek deference for a 

view of the law that affected parties had no

 chance to be heard about.

 What do we do with that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think, with 

respect to the category of interpretive rules, 

it's -- it's true that the Court hasn't ruled 

out that those can receive deference in 

appropriate circumstances, but in --

deference --

what Mead means.  I mean, it's got seven factors 

to it, and the lower courts complain about that 

too. So I'm not -- I don't -- I don't know

that Chevron has core application to 

adjudications, and I agree that in that 

circumstance, there's not the same ability to 

take the input from all comers. But the Court 

has emphasized that in the mine-run case where 

it has been applying Chevron deference, there is 

this possibility at least of a centralized 

decision-making process in order to ensure that

the agency at least is gathering the facts and 

has the tools at its disposal.

 And the alternative to each of these, 

Justice Gorsuch, is to have the courts do it

 through piecemeal litigation.  At the very 

least, I think that it's easy to see why 

Congress might think that that is not as good of

 an alternative in a circumstance where the 

Court's pronouncements could come out of nowhere 

with respect to a particular party.  You know,

concern and what I was focusing on with respect

they're not going to have notice about somebody 

else's case, but when the government comes for 

them, they get to take their case to court. 

They get a neutral judge.

they are a party, they have an opportunity --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But Congress has

 often expressed a preference for not having 

these kinds of issues resolved piece by piece in

 different courts around the country with the

 prospect of the disuniformity that that would

 create.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yes. It has 

provided for notice and -- it provided for

 formal and informal -- formal rulemaking and 

adjudications, and it anticipated most rules 

would be resolved that way.  In fact, they 

aren't.  For a long time, the -- those processes 

haven't been used, and -- and agencies rely on 

informal adjudications and informal rulemakings. 

And really now today, perhaps as a product of 

Chevron at two, agencies have -- have abdicated 

that and are moving more and more toward 

interpretive rules where they don't have to 

provide notice-and-comment. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But I think that 

does circle us back to the fact that the Court 

has not suggested that interpretive rules are 

necessarily going to trigger deference.  And so 

I think, at least in the mine-run case that this 

Court has looked at, it's the product of --

 GENERAL PRELOGAR: -- a formal process 

from the agency, and I think it's an important

 process.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On -- on the 

adjudications front, and I think one of the 

amicus briefs talks specifically about the NLRB

 in particular and kind of how that agency moves 

from pillar to post fairly often and the concern 

raised there because that is a situation you --

you can't adjust your behavior ahead of time 

necessarily based on a new rule, a new changed 

interpretation, when it's done in the particular 

case and affects the people who didn't have 

notice.  Do you have any response to that brief 

or that scenario, or want to tell me why that's 

wrong? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I guess my 

overarching response to that set of concerns is 

that the agency has to justify its 

decision-making with respect to whatever tool 

it's using to implement the statute in the way 

that Congress directed.  So, if Congress is 

telling the agency you should adjudicate or you 

should conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking or

tools, the agency in either context is going to

 have to justify what it's doing.

 And, in particular, my friends have

 focused a lot on the idea of agencies changing

 their minds.  You know, there are burdens in

 this context.  The agency has to take account of

 reliance interests.  A lot of this gets put into 

State Farm, of course. But I think also, at 

Chevron step two, with respect to 

reasonableness, a court can permissibly take 

those kinds of considerations into account. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Did you want to finish 

your answer about what you would say to your 

friend's view of fictionalized intent? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So I was 

trying to defend Chevron as a matter of first 

principles, and that was kind of the first-order 

answer on this, that there are often really good 

reasons why Congress would want an expert agency 

to take the first crack at filling in the law. 

And there's no way around it, if the 

agency is administering the statute, the agency 

has got to do it.  And this Court has said that

a core feature of executing the law is

 interpreting statutes along the way, 

understanding, for the agency, what the law

 means.

 The second point I wanted to make is 

that even in the situation where you think 

there's more room for doubt about exactly what

 was happening in 1984 and what Congress would 

have expected, this is a really foundational 

precedent from the Court.  It's not like Chevron 

has flown under the radar and Congress is 

unaware of it and doesn't realize it's out there 

and kind of setting the ground rules for how 

this Court and lower courts are going to 

understand what Congress is doing. 

This is one of the most frequently 

cited decisions from the Court, and in that 

context in particular, I would think that the 

inference of legislative intent becomes all the 

more sound because Congress has not chosen to 

displace it and, as well, it triggers, I think, 

that critical strong form of stare decisis that 

the Court applied in Kisor when it recognized 

that in a situation where Congress is actually 

the best institutional actor to do something

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I have a range

 of reactions to that.  My first is, as I was

 suggesting to Justice Gorsuch, we think -- and 

to Justice Thomas, we think that there is a lot 

in this statute to support the agency's exercise 

of regulatory authority here, and I want to 

point in particular to the penalty provision,

 which specifically contemplates that the -- the 

regulated vessels might have a contractual 

relationship with third-party monitors and, 

therefore, might be in a situation where they 

haven't paid, and it says the Secretary can 

sanction in that circumstance. 

So it's premised on the idea that 

there will be certain circumstances when there 

is that direct relationship.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just as a footnote 

in the schedule, in the way that Congress did 

the other two monitors, they were always 

government monitors, not independent monitors, 

correct? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So, in the --

the -- so there are three fee-based programs 

that my -- my friends have relied on to try to 

support this idea that there's a negative

 inference you should draw from the statute.

 Two of those apply in the domestic 

context and those operate as pure fee-based

 programs, so it's very different.  Ultimately, 

they pay fees to the government. The government 

provides a range of services, including

 providing the monitors, entering into the

 contractual relationship, and having those

 monitors be government -- contractors. 

And those programs also pay for 

particular administrative expenses that would 

not be a part of this program.  The -- the 

foreign vessel program, likewise, operates in 

this fee-based way. There is a residual part of 

that program which contemplates that in a 

circumstance where there aren't sufficient 

funds, it might be possible that the regulated 

vessel will then, through a supplementary 

authority, be required to contract with the 

monitors directly. 

And I think my friends would say: 

Well, that's the whole explanation for the 

penalty provision.  But it doesn't work because 

Congress put that penalty provision in an 

overarching section of the Act that applies to

 domestic vessels too.

 If this was really just meant to be a

 tendril to tack on to the foreign vessel 

program, that would be completely inexplicable. 

So I think that they don't have a persuasive 

response to the penalty provisions here.

 Now they say, to -- to wrap this up,

 that, you know, the -- it's -- it's unheard of

 to charge 20 percent.  I do want to be really 

clear, they are latching on to a part of the 

rule that acknowledged that earlier versions or 

studies had suggested that costs could go 

potentially up to 20 percent.  But then the 

agency acted in response to that.  It created 

waivers.  It created exemptions. 

And with respect to some of the types 

of fishing at issue in these cases, the 

estimated costs were more in the range of 2 to 

3 percent.  So it's -- this is all, you know, 

something that courts can look at and review. 

They, in fact, pressed arguments that this rule 

was arbitrary and capricious for neglecting to 

give full attention to the costs.  The lower

rightly so.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Justice Barrett asked

 before about Kisorizing Chevron, and I just 

wanted to ask, what would that mean? I mean,

 would it mean doing exactly what Kisor did to

 Auer deference, to Chevron deference?  Would

 there be adjustments that would be necessary? 

Would one want to go further in any respect?

 What -- what does it mean to Kisorize Chevron? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that the 

Court in this case, if it has some concerns 

about the implementation issues, could do four 

critical things, which draw heavily on Kisor but 

I think look a little different in their 

particulars. 

The first thing the Court could do 

would be to reemphasize the rigor of the step 

one analysis.  Now this is drawn directly from 

Kisor. As I mentioned before, we've seen 

results in the lower courts where they are now 

following this Court's direction with respect to 

that. 

So, in this regard, what the Court 

would be saying is don't wave the ambiguity flag 

too readily.  Don't give up just because the

statute is dense or hard to parse. Instead, 

there are a lot of hard questions out there that 

can be solved and reveal Congress's intent if

 the court applies all of the tools and really

 exhausts them.  So that would take care of a

 whole category of cases.

 Then, at step two, I think the Court 

could again do what it did in Kisor, which was 

to reinforce that reasonableness is not just 

anything goes.  You know, Justice Gorsuch, I 

think, at times has said it just means the 

government wins.  But that is not actually the 

standard. 

Even at that step two stage, it's 

obviously deferential, but the Court should be 

enforcing any outer bounds in the statute and 

making sure that the agency hasn't transgressed 

those. 

I think the third thing the Court 

could do is emphasize that this whole enterprise 

only gets off the ground in a me-type situation 

where you have the agency being directly 

empowered by Congress to speak with the force of 

law and then exercising appropriately a formal 

level of authority in implementing the statute.

And so I think that that is an 

important principle as well, that there are 

certain contexts in which the agency is not 

actually speaking with the force of law or in a 

way that would be fitting with the delegation

 Congress has provided.

 And then, finally, the fourth thing 

that the Court could do, and I think this is a

 little bit different from Kisor, would be to 

emphasize that it's always important to look at 

any other statutory indication that Chevron 

deference was not meant to apply. 

And what I'm thinking here of are --

are things like situations where the nature of 

the statutory question as the Court has said in 

other cases isn't one where you would expect 

Congress to give that to the agency.  There's a 

flavor of this in the Major Questions Doctrine 

case, and I don't want to rule out other 

scenarios that could come up because part of our 

-- our central argument here is Congress can 

adjust, Congress can react, Congress can take 

statute-specific steps, and so courts should pay 

attention to that.  And there is nothing in 

Chevron that dictates that this presumption is

 irrevocable.  Instead, it's fully rebuttable.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is there anything 

you would say about the matter of changed

 interpretations? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: So I think that 

changed interpretations already are an area

 where the agency is under additional burdens to

 justify its decision-making.  I think they get a

 harder look. 

And the Court has made clear that in a 

circumstance where an agency is changing its 

regulatory approach, one of the things it has to 

do is take full account of the reliance 

interests and explain why those shouldn't alter 

what it's doing in -- in -- in the kind of 

revised approach. 

The agency also frequently, if it's 

come from a notice-and-comment rulemaking, has 

to run that process all over again. That's a 

time-intensive process. It takes a substantial 

investment of agency resources.  So I think, in 

that context too, the Court could police the 

bounds of that and make sure that the agency is 

following the procedural requirements to ensure 

that it's informed decision-making.

But, at the end of the day, if the 

agency can run the gauntlet and survive those 

hurdles, then the fact that it has some 

discretion under the statute to change its

 approach, I think, is not something to say is --

is, you know, kind of a bug in the statute. 

Instead, it's a feature because there are all 

kinds of circumstances where Congress would want 

to give the agency the ability to adapt to 

changing circumstances, to new factual 

information, or to the experience it's 

accumulated under the prior program.

all the problems with this fictional implied 

delegation because the great thing about an

 express delegation is you have some text.

 What an express delegation generally 

does textually is delegate implementing or

 executing authority.  It doesn't do what Chevron

 purports to do, which is to delegate

 interpretive authority.

 But, better yet, once you have text, 

you can put limits on the text.  And Michigan 

against EPA is a perfect example of that. And, 

of course, all of these delegations do raise 

Article I non-delegation concerns. And if you 

have text, you can check for that as well. But 

I can't think of anything that's more 

antithetical to an intelligible principle than 

ambiguity and silence. 

And I will say in terms of the -- the 

-- you know, this premise, I think it's entirely 

fictional. I think in most cases a statute is 

ambiguous because the proponent did not have 

enough votes to make it any clearer. 

My friend at one point said that I 

view the whole world as every statute has a 

binary answer.  To be clear, my position was the

 opposite.  There are statutes like that,

 reasonableness, appropriateness. There are also 

things like information services,

 telecommunication services, a service advisor. 

Is it a salesperson who is involved in the

 servicing of cars?  I'd say yes, but you could 

say no, but it's binary.

 The terrible thing about Chevron is it 

can't tell the two apart because, at a certain 

point, they both look ambiguous. But if you --

what -- you know what can tell the two apart? 

Good old-fashioned statutory construction.  Find 

out as the courts what the words mean. 

"Reasonable" is a term of capaciousness and 

elasticity.  "Telecommunication service" is not. 

Good old-fashioned statutory interpretation can 

do the job. 

Now let me say the -- one thing about 

the mystery of why Section 706 did not appear in 

the Chevron decision.  There's a really easy 

answer.  It was a Clean Air Act case. 

The Court sort of stumbled into these 

pronouncements about how as a meta matter you 

should go about statutory consideration.  It was 

a mistake.  It didn't wrestle with the relevant

 statute at all.

 That is a special justification to 

revisit the decision and to get the decision

 right.

 Let me say one word about expertise.

 Expertise and deference do not have to go hand 

in hand in a way that precludes de novo review.

 We have things called tax courts.  We have

 things called bankruptcy courts. We have the 

Court of International Trade.  They all deal 

with technical specialized issues.  Every one of 

them, the legal questions are reviewed de novo. 

That's the basic understanding with a statute 

like 77 -- Section 706. 

Lastly, let me say this.  You cannot 

Kisorize the Chevron doctrine without overruling 

Brand X. The fact that you could take into 

account if the agency had flip-flopped was part 

of the rationale of Kisor, many factors before 

you applied Auer. 

That is a feature, my friend correctly 

admits, that is a feature of the Chevron 

doctrine, and you really can't Kisorize it

just went out the window and we might as well

 The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 1:37 p.m., the case was 

submitted.)
