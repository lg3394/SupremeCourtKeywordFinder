 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-448, Consumer

 Financial Protection Bureau versus the

 Community Financial Services Association.

 General Prelogar.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The Fifth Circuit's decision in this 

case is the first time any court in our 

nation's history has held that Congress 

violated the Appropriations Clause by enacting 

a statute providing funding. 

This Court should uphold the CFPB's 

funding statute because it is firmly grounded 

in constitutional text and in historical 

practice dating back to the founding. 

The text of the Constitution shows 

that when the Framers wanted to limit 

Congress's appropriations authority, they did 

so expressly.  And while the Framers restricted 

appropriations for the Army to two years, they

applied no similar limits on appropriations for

 any other agency.

 History confirms that point.  Since

 the founding, Congress has consistently funded

 agencies through standing appropriations that

 are not time-limited and that provide 

significant discretion over how much to spend.

 The first Congress did exactly this

 with the very first agency it created, the 

Customs Service, and the same is true for other 

founding-era agencies, including the Post 

Office, the National Mint, the Patent Office, 

revenue officers, and the National Bank. 

And Congress has used this kind of 

appropriation as the default when funding 

financial regulators, including the Federal 

Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of 

the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation, the National Credit Union 

Administration, the Farm Credit Administration, 

and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 

The CFPB's appropriation fits squarely 

within this unbroken line of historical 

practice.  In fact, Congress exercised 

significantly more discretion and control over

the Bureau's funding by capping its annual 

appropriation in an amount that is far lower

 than many other agencies' budgets.

 Respondents argue that the combination 

of features in the CFPB statute violates some

 previously unrecognized constitutional line. 

But the Bureau's appropriation is materially

 identical to the numerous funding statutes I 

just listed, and Respondents concede those 

statutes are constitutional. 

This Court should reject Respondents' 

attempt to gerrymander a rule to fit the CFPB 

alone without providing a coherent theory about 

how to interpret and apply the Appropriations 

Clause. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, other than 

passing an appropriations law, are there any 

limits on what Congress can do? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I think, at 

the outset, as your question touches on, 

Justice Thomas, the term "appropriation" itself 

contains some essential requirements.  So that 

term is defined to mean a law that provides for 

funding and that specifies both the source and

the purpose of the funding. That's how an

 appropriation was defined at the founding, it's

 how it's always been understood, and that's 

still how it's defined today in sources like 

the GAO Red Book, which is Congress's own

 appropriations treatise.

 So we think that at the outset, it's 

not just any old law but a law that contains

 those features that constitutes an 

appropriation. 

And then I think the question becomes, 

are there other limits out there on how 

Congress can structure funding for a particular 

type of activities or government functions?  We 

know, obviously, from the Army Appropriations 

Clause that the answer is yes. With respect to 

that particular government function, there's a 

durational limit, and it's based on the nature 

of the activity because the Framers were 

specifically concerned about having a standing 

Army. 

But I think the Army Appropriations 

Clause itself demonstrates that there are not 

otherwise constraints in the Appropriations 

Clause that would limit Congress in how it

decides to structure the funding.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So, beyond the -- the 

initial almost skeletal requirements of

 duration and purpose, there isn't -- I'm hear 

-- if I hear you right, there is no other

 condition?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We don't think that

 the Appropriations Clause places those limits 

on Congress itself when it enacts a funding 

statute, but I do want to emphasize that our 

argument here also relies heavily on history. 

And so, if you have in mind some kind of 

funding statute or arrangement that's never 

been done in all of this nation's history, I 

think the Court could take that into account in 

a future case. 

Here, though, we have a specific type 

of appropriation, a capped lump-sum 

appropriation that's standing for a single 

agency, and our historical argument is that 

this is nothing new or unprecedented.  All of 

the agencies I previously listed had similar 

appropriations. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Are there any -- is 

there any role in appropriations -- that --

that appropriations plays in the separation of

 powers?  It seems that at least when I did --

was in the executive branch, that Congress

 exercised appropriation to check the executive

 branch to some extent.

 If there is in this case, what would

 be -- in the case of CFPB, how would that play

 out?

of powers that Congress has control over the

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Our argument here 

is that Congress has exercised that power. 

This Court, of course, is looking at a statute 

that Congress itself enacted that set up this 

funding mechanism for the CFPB which is similar 

in kind to the way that Congress has funded 

other financial regulatory agencies.

 control that Congress usually exercises in the

 appropriations process?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't.  And, you

 know, to the extent that this question is

 pressing on the annual appropriations --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- as a kind of 

counterpart here, I think that the question 

becomes, does the Constitution limit Congress 

with respect to the duration of appropriations? 

Is there some kind of implicit limit in the 

text that the Court could divine that means 

that Congress, in contrast to other laws, 

which, of course, can remain in effect until a 

future Congress acts -- is Congress limited in 

how long to leave appropriations in effect? 

And, there, I think the Army 

Appropriations Clause does a lot of work 

because it's not like the Framers weren't aware 

of this dynamic.  They thought specifically 

about the fact that appropriations, like all 

other laws, might be continuing, indefinite 

until a future Congress acts, and they were 

concerned about that with respect to a standing 

Army, but they didn't otherwise seek to limit

 Congress's authority.  I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, one 

of the things that struck me as I was reading

 it, your -- you have a very aggressive view of 

Congress's authority under the Appropriations

 Clause.  I'm not saying remotely that that's 

not correct, but it struck me -- I mean, you're 

-- represent -- you represent the executive

 branch as well, and it -- it's a very strong 

power given to Congress. 

And it struck me that the reason you 

would want to defend that is because it gives 

them more power to give away. And there are 

obviously -- legend has it there have been 

times when the same party controlled both 

houses of Congress and the White House, and in 

that situation, you can see Congress empowering 

the President in a way that might seem unusual 

to the Framers. 

So keeping in mind that -- that 

imbalance -- in other words, it's kind of 

paradoxical, the more power you give Congress, 

I think, the more -- and this is, I think, your 

friend's argument on the other side -- there --

there's more that it can give away and enhance

 Is that an unpersuasive concern?

          GENERAL PRELOGAR: Well, certainly, I

 don't think it's an unpersuasive concern, but

 built into your question as I understood it, 

Mr. Chief Justice, was the idea that maybe

 Congress could do something that would be 

surprising or anomalous to the Framers.

 And I guess what I would say is that 

if -- if you're looking at it through that 

lens, then history should play a powerful role 

in trying to understand the limits or scope of, 

you know, how much Congress can give away, when 

does it become too much. 

And, here, the Court doesn't need to 

articulate any outer limits because we have a 

very specific type of appropriation that's 

actually far more constrained than many that 

Congress has enacted throughout history because 

Congress provided funding for a single agency 

and actually capped that amount of funding in 

an amount not to exceed the cap set by 

Congress. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's 

pretty unusual to have that agency drawing its

there is anything unprecedented about this

relevant constitutional value of protecting 

Congress's prerogatives. 

And I know that there are a lot of 

different moving parts and pieces to the 

arguments Respondents have made, but as I 

understand it, they are attacking four features 

of the funding statute:  the fact that it's a 

standing appropriation, so it remains in place 

and is not time-limited; that it gives the 

director of the CFPB some discretion to act

within the statutory cap in requesting the

 funding; third, that the CFPB has enforcement

 and regulatory functions; and, fourth, as your

 question touched on, that the CFPB's funding 

comes from a source that's not, in their words,

 constrained by market forces.

 But we have numerous examples of 

agencies that have all four of those relevant 

characteristics. I dispute at the outset that 

we don't actually think the functions or the 

market forces constraint are relevant, but even 

taking the argument on its own terms, I can 

give you founding-era examples. 

The Customs Service and the revenue 

officers were funded with that kind of 

mechanism.  They had standing appropriations. 

For the Customs Service, it was uncapped. 

These were powerful regulatory entities.  The 

Customs Service could board ships and seize 

vessels and inspect records and conduct 

searches and levy penalties and collect fines, 

and there was no way to avoid that kind of 

regulation. 

So the market constraint theory that 

the users could just opt out or regulated

understand, following up on the Chief Justice's 

question, what role the upper limit plays on 

your theory of the case. 

Is that an essential feature to the 

constitutionality of this provision, or could 

Congress pass the same law with no upper limit, 

allowing the executive branch to determine 

however much it wished to take? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So we don't think 

that Congress would have to provide a -- a

course, have to specify the purpose of the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right.  Okay.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- from 1789 on.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And how about on

 the -- on the lower end of the scale? What if

 the President decided zero was the appropriate

 sum? I'm not going to take any money.  I don't 

like the CFPB. You know, I don't think it's 

reasonably necessary to take another dollar. 

Could the President do that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that 

would violate the statute as well.  At that 

point, the CFPB --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, I'm talking 

about the Appropriations Clause. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So -- so I think 

that, you know, Congress itself has specified 

the purpose. And so I think that if the 

President or if the CFPB director didn't comply 

with the statute, that would be a violation, 

and I would expect Congress to step in and 

change the funding mechanism. 

But all of these theoretical 

possibilities exist with respect to countless 

other appropriations.  All of the other

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I understand -- I 

understand the practical realities, and I 

appreciate them, and I understand the statutory

 Appropriations Clause theory. 

Is there anything that would prohibit 

the President from -- in the Appropriations 

Clause -- from deciding whether to take zero 

dollars and we've already established he could 

take a trillion? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think the 

Appropriations Clause would be a check there, 

although, of course, Congress could then 

exercise its authority and its power over the 

purse to change the discretion that's provided 

to require the President or the director of the 

agency to take a particular amount.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- the -- the

 Treasury?  So the professors of constitutional

 law and history say, listen, the Appropriations

 Clause doesn't even apply here at all because 

these funds aren't being drawn from the

 Treasury.

 Do you agree with that argument?  It's

 not the argument that you made.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We are not making 

that argument.  We accept that the 

Appropriations Clause applies here.  The reason 

for that is we understand the term in the 

Constitution to refer to the public treasury as 

a general matter, not specifically to the 

Treasury Department. 

Of course, at the time of the 

founding, ratification, the Treasury Department 

hadn't even been created, and that's also how 

this Court has described the scope of the 

Appropriations Clause in cases like OPM versus 

Richmond, where it referred to public monies 

generally. 

And, of course, the -- the contrary 

approach would expose a gaping loophole in 

Congress's authority here --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- because it would

 mean the executive, if it has funds that aren't 

held in the general treasury, could spend even 

without Congress appropriating it or providing 

that authority in the first place.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are the -- are the

 money in -- the monies in the CFPB's budget

 appropriated monies? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, for 

constitutional purposes, yes, because Congress 

established this funding statute and it 

specified both the source and the funding.  So, 

within the meaning of the Constitution, this 

counts as an appropriation.  That's how OPM and 

the executive branch and GAO and Congress 

understand the source of the funding here. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What do we make of the 

provision in the Dodd-Frank Act which says that 

the Bureau fund "shall not be construed to be 

government funds or appropriated monies"? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So that was 

Congress trying to control for the interaction 

between this funding mechanism and other 

background rules that apply to appropriations

that go through the annual appropriation

 process.

 There are rules out there about things 

like procurement and whether you can use 

appropriated monies in that sense for

 litigation expenses.  The miscellaneous receipt 

statute requires agencies to deposit their 

revenues in the general treasury, and some of 

these background rules would actually interfere 

with the funding that Congress intended for 

this agency. So I think it was just trying to 

control for the interaction there. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So it was wrong? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And other agencies 

have the same provision. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  That statement -- that 

statement is incorrect in the -- in the 

Dodd-Frank Act itself, it's incorrect?  These 

are appropriated monies? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I don't think 

that that statutory provision was taking a 

stance on the constitutional question of 

whether this fits the definition of an 

appropriation within the meaning of the 

Constitution.

And as I mentioned, Congress has used 

this formulation for other agencies as well, 

like the OCC and the FCA, and I think, again,

 it's -- it's all intended to just allow 

Congress to control for the interaction of 

various statutory provisions in this context.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does it use --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it for -- does 

it use it for the Post Office and for the Mint

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, Justice 

Sotomayor, I'm not familiar with whether this 

particular language appears in the statutes 

governing the Post Office. 

You know, the Post Office, of course, 

was originally created and funded in -- in 

1792, and so it's not clear that some of these 

other background rules existed, but, certainly, 

we can point to examples today, including the 

OCC and the FCA, which have this same language, 

and I think it's meant to ensure, again, that 

there's no disruption with the funding 

operating in the way that Congress intended.

Justice Thomas's question? There appears to be 

-- I'm sorry, I'm a bit congested. There 

appears to be wound up in this question of the 

appropriations bill the separation of powers

 and non-delegation.

 Now I know the court below said

 non-delegation was forfeited.  I'm not quite

 sure I understand -- and maybe you could

 explain it to me -- how separation of power is 

different from non-delegation?  So, if one was 

forfeited, why wasn't the other? 

But do you see those two other 

provisions, separation of power and 

non-delegation, as having a place in other 

constitutional provisions besides the 

Appropriations Clause?  And if it has no place 

here, why not? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. So I think 

that, obviously, these concepts of separation 

of powers and the scope of the Appropriations 

Clause and non-delegation principles have in --

in many respects potentially overlapping 

functions. 

In this context, we understood 

Respondents to be making an argument about the

Appropriations Clause in particular, and the

 Fifth Circuit found that they hadn't separately

 raised a non-delegation challenge.

 You know, I guess what I would say is 

that to the extent the Court is thinking about

 this from the perspective of general separation

 of powers principles, the -- the things that 

the Court generally consults in understanding

 the structural provisions of the Constitution 

are, first, the text, and, second, the history. 

Those indicators of intent here are 

overwhelmingly on our side. 

And then, if the Court is thinking 

about it from delegation principles, I think 

there too you would have to look at history. 

And as Justice Scalia emphasized in his 

concurring opinion in Clinton versus City of 

New York, if you look across the course of 

history from 1789 on, it has been, in the 

appropriations context, marked by very broad 

delegations of authority to the executive 

branch to spend within the bounds set by 

Congress.

one in the sense of providing that the

 executive could spend up to a -- a cap that was

 set by Congress itself.

 So I think that, you know, the

 cleanest way to think about the arguments

 Respondents are presenting is under the 

Appropriations Clause, but I recognize that as 

the Court is thinking more broadly about these 

issues, the other doctrines could come into 

play. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, could I --

could I take you back to the line of 

questioning that you and Justice Gorsuch were 

talking about?  In your reply brief, on page 

18, you discuss a -- a -- a -- a standing 

appropriation of "up to a quadrillion dollars 

for the President to fund as he deems fit the 

entire federal government, besides the Army." 

So just on this question of where your 

outer limits are and what theory we might use 

to say there are some limits, what -- what do 

you want to say about that sort of statute? 

Would that be a constitutional violation?  If 

so, why so?  And why is that different from 

this?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. So that

 statute, as we understand it, is -- you know,

 would be completely unprecedented.  It would 

effectively take the whole of Congress's 

appropriations authority and transfer it to the

 executive branch.

 Congress has never done that for the

 past 230-plus years, and it's hard for me to

 imagine Congress ever would do that.  But I 

think, if the Court were confronted with that 

issue in a future case, it could well recognize 

limits and the limits would come from history. 

The Court, in -- in any number of 

separation of powers cases, has said that the 

fact that a method of structuring government 

has no historical precedent can strongly 

counsel against recognizing it as a 

constitutional way to proceed.  That was the 

analysis the Court said in Free Enterprise 

Fund. It repeated it in Seila Law. 

But that history works both ways.  The 

Court has likewise said that the fact that a 

way of structuring government is well rooted in 

history and traces back to the founding is 

powerful evidence of the contemporaneous

 understanding of original intent, and that's

 the box we're in here.

 So I guess I would urge the Court to 

save for another day whether there's some

 theoretical possibility that Congress could go 

too far with a kind of appropriation we've

 never seen before and instead focus on this 

particular appropriations law, which we think

 finds its roots both in text and history. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I have the same 

question, basically, that Justice Kagan just 

asked you. Your response in your reply brief 

was an answer to a -- an argument that was made 

by the Respondents on page 24 of their brief, 

where they say:  "If the Bureau is correct that 

there is no constitutional limit on Congress's 

power to pass laws providing funding to 

agencies, then a single Congress could allocate 

each year forever up to a trillion dollars to 

an agency like the FBI or FTC or even up to a 

quadrillion dollars for the President to fund 

as he deems fit the entire federal government 

besides the Army." 

Now you answered the latter part of 

that in your reply brief about the quadrillion

dollars, and you just answered that in response

 to Justice Kagan.  You didn't answer the first 

part of that about providing a very substantial 

sum of money to an agency like the FBI or the

 FTC.

 So I -- I just want to understand what

 you think the limiting principle is.  Let's

 take -- let's take the FTC, which I think had a 

budget of $430 million. So let's say there's a 

law that allocates forever 1 -- up to $1 

billion adjusted for inflation to the FTC to 

use as the FTC sees fit. 

Would that be consistent with the 

Appropriations Clause? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: So I think, at the 

outset, if the law said "however the FTC deems 

fit," it's not clear that would count as an 

appropriation because it's not clear Congress 

would have specified the purpose.  But I 

recognize you can tweak it and say, you know, 

"to carry out the FTC's functions." 

In that context, I think the 

hypothetical would effectively be a standing 

uncapped appropriation because, of course, the 

FTC would never reach that amount.  It would be

for a single agency.  And we think that that is

 well grounded in history and, in fact, is how 

many agencies are funded today, particularly in

 the financial regulatory space.

 But, if you have concerns about that 

principle, here, of course, we have the

 statutory cap.  And Respondents say, you know, 

the cap is illusory, that it's more like the

 hypotheticals we've just been touching on. 

But I don't see how they can tenably 

make that argument when the cap is set at $600 

million adjusted only for inflation, and many 

of the agencies from which the CFPB inherited 

its responsibilities have far larger budgets, 

1.8 billion for the OCC, around a billion for 

the Federal Reserve Board, over a billion for 

the FDIC. 

This is a meaningful restraint, and I 

think it just demonstrates that if the Court 

thinks it's important to have that constraint 

here, the CFPB is even more under Congress's 

control than these other agencies.

 So I understand your answer to these

 hypotheticals is that we must look to

 Congress's historical practices. This is a

 matter of -- of seeing whether the setup that 

we have before us is consistent with Congress's

 historical practices.  Is that right?

it the test? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that the --

the test in this context, as in most separation 

of powers cases, is, yes, text and history.

constitutional provision speaking to duration, 

speaking to particular types of functions,

 other functions. 

And then we have an unbroken line of

 history.  There have been agencies funded this 

way for every year of this nation's history.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what is your

 best historic -- your single best example of an

CFPB has that are cited by the Respondents, 

single best example of an agency with all of 

the -- with that combination of features? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think our best 

example historically is the Customs Service. 

The first Congress created the Customs Service 

in 1789.  It gave the Customs Service a 

standing, uncapped source of funding from the 

revenues that the Customs Service collected 

through things including coercive law 

enforcement activity, things like levying 

fines, also from import duties, which could not 

be avoided if you wanted to engage in trade 

with the new nation.  And the Customs Service 

was one of the most powerful agencies that was

originally created because it was so important 

to have a stream of funding for the new

 republic.

 So I think that if you look through 

all of the factors they're challenging here, we 

have the Customs Service and others, the

 revenue officers; U.S. Attorneys for a period 

of time were funded through conviction fees.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your best 

example of an agency that draws its money from 

another agency that, in turn, does not get its 

money from a congressional appropriation in the 

normal sense of that term but gets it from the 

private sector? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I can't 

give you another example of a source that's 

precisely like that one, but I would dispute 

the premise that that could possibly be 

constitutionally relevant.  This is a case 

about Congress's own prerogatives over the 

purse, its authority.  And if Congress has 

given away too much of its authority by not 

providing for a durational limit or not

 fee-funded agencies directly collect their 

money from the entities they regulate.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So I take it your

 answer is that you do not -- that is not 

consistent with any historical practice, but 

you think that to the extent it is 

unprecedented, it is unprecedented in a way

 that is not relevant for present purposes?  Is 

that your answer? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, primarily.  I 

think it would be unprecedented in the way that 

you could say this is the only agency that has 

the acronym CFPB. That's obviously true also, 

but it doesn't track the constitutional value. 

But I also just want to make the 

factual point that I don't understand them to 

be saying it's significant that it's structured 

this way in the abstract.  They say what it 

means is that there's not a check on the 

overall amount of funding the CFPB could get 

and there is a check on those other agencies. 

And that's wrong as a descriptive 

matter.  There is no similar checked on the 

Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the NCUA, the

equivalent to public money?  Do you think 

appropriated funds are the same thing as 

"public money"?

qualify as public money, yes.

substantial power but provided no method for 

that agency to obtain money other than private

 donations?  Would that be consistent with the

 Appropriations Clause?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that likely

 would be consistent.  You know, that obviously

 speaks to the question of source.  And I think

 that Congress has chosen different sources over 

time, but I don't think there's anything in the 

text of the Constitution that limits Congress's 

ability to try to determine the ways it wants 

to structure those kinds of funding mechanisms. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So suppose Congress 

said there are a lot of outside entities that 

have a great interest in the work of the SEC, 

so we don't think we need to appropriate any 

money for the SEC.  The SEC can simply rely on 

private donations and build up its own 

endowment, so to speak. 

Would that be constitutional? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that it 

likely would qualify as constitutional.  Of 

course, if that created some kind of regulatory 

capture, I would expect that Congress would act 

to fix that, but, you know, there are examples

 Sotomayor? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, it might 

be a good sign or a bad sign, I don't know. 

Nobody's talked about remedy.  Let me give you 

an opportunity to summarize your best argument 

why the Court below erred in its broad remedy 

of striking down basically not just this Payday 

Lending Rule but basically saying anything this 

agency's done since the beginning is invalid. 

So can you tell us how you deal with 

that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes. The Fifth 

Circuit here recognized a sweeping 

retrospective remedy that we think conflicts 

with both severability principles and 

traditional remedial equitable principles in 

this space.

Just first on severability, Dodd-Frank

 itself has an express severability clause. 

This Court emphasized that point in Seila Law. 

And, here, the Fifth Circuit didn't even stop 

to consider whether any aspect of the CFPB's 

funding mechanism could be severed or would

 provide a basis to therefore limit the damage 

to Congress's work in trying to get this agency

 funded. 

I think that was error and that there 

are several candidates for severability that 

would be a much less disruptive remedy in this 

context and would not entitle Respondents to 

any relief because the Payday Lending Rule they 

challenge isn't traceable to those features or 

aspects of the funding mechanism. 

But even if you followed the Fifth 

Circuit's approach and thought that there was 

something about this entire funding mechanism 

that's invalid, even then I don't think a 

retrospective remedy is warranted. 

You know, the Court would be writing 

on a blank slate because no court had 

previously found that Congress itself violated 

the Appropriations Clause, but under

 traditional remedial equitable principles, it's 

necessary to take into account the public 

interest and the balance of the equities.

 And, here, a prospective remedy which

 would prevent the CFPB from enforcing this rule

 against Respondents until it has a valid

 appropriation would give them a meaningful form

 of relief.  And, instead, the retrospective

 remedy that the court adopted is sweeping in 

implications and would be profoundly 

disruptive. 

I would point in particular to the 

amicus brief that was filed by the Mortgage 

Bankers Association that explains how many 

entities in various industries have critically 

relied on the CFPB's regulations, including, in 

particular, in the housing finance space. 

These create safe harbors for lenders so that 

they will be deemed to be in compliance with 

statutory requirements on things like ability 

to pay and on disclosure requirements. 

And if the Fifth Circuit is right and 

there's the prospect that all of these actions 

should be unwound, it would create profound 

disruption in various economic -- economic

 precedent?  Is -- is part of the lesson of 

history here that there's been enormous

 variation in the kinds of appropriations that 

Congress has made? How should we think about

 that feature of our history?  Take it away.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think it is 

absolutely correct to say that there has been

 enormous variation in how Congress has

 exercised -- exercised its appropriations power 

over the course of history. 

Obviously, with respect to each of 

these challenged features, we think we have a 

wealth of evidence regarding standing 

appropriations or appropriations up to a 

particular cap. 

But I don't want to lose sight of the 

fact that if the Court were to approach this 

issue looking at the combination of features, 

this is not novel, and I -- I want to try to 

unpack a little bit why that's so, because 

Justice Alito had asked me a couple of 

questions about the source of the funding and, 

in particular, about the idea that maybe the

it draws its funds from the Federal Reserve

 Board.

 And I think the reason why that

 doesn't work and why it shows that this is not

 unprecedented is that the whole theory behind 

that premise is that that's a constraint on

 other agencies.  Market forces will limit the 

overall pot of funding the other agencies have.

 But that's not accurate as a 

descriptive matter with respect to things like 

the Federal Reserve Board itself, which 

regulates and assesses money on the Federal 

Reserve Banks required to stay in the system. 

They can't leave. 

And if the overall value here is to 

determine does the agency have some limiting 

check on the overall amount of funds, the CFPB 

is far more constricted because it has a 

statutory cap actually imposed by Congress 

rather than regulated entities. 

And I think, if the Court is looking 

at all of the features together, maybe some 

things subtract out Congress a little bit, but 

the cap adds in Congress in a very powerful and 

major way that I think distinguishes this

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Gorsuch?

 Justice Kavanaugh?

          JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Just two 

clarifying questions about the limits of your

 argument.  There's a discussion sometimes about 

permanent appropriations and forever 

appropriations. 

My understanding, but I want to make 

sure you agree, is that Congress could not 

entrench a funding scheme, in other words, 

Congress could not pass a law that says this is 

the funding scheme and no future Congress may 

alter this for 10 years or a hundred years. 

That would be constitutionally problematic, is 

my understanding, and I want to make sure you 

agree with that. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, I absolutely 

share that understanding, Justice Kavanaugh. 

And I think what it shows is that it's 

incorrect to characterize standing 

appropriations as lasting forever.

In fact, we've pointed to a number of 

examples where Congress has acted to change the

 standing appropriations, and the Customs 

Service is a great example on this one too. 

You know, it was funded through a standing 

appropriation for the first 120 years of this 

nation's history, and then, in 1912, Congress 

took it out of a standing appropriation and

 brought it into annual appropriations. 

Congress just did this again in the 

debt limit bill recently.  It rescinded many 

standing appropriations that had been part of 

the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation 

Reduction Act, and I think it just demonstrates 

that there is always that additional check of a 

future Congress deciding that it wants to alter 

the work of a prior Congress. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So Congress could 

change it tomorrow? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Absolutely, 

Congress could change it tomorrow. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And then, 

if the statute here gave the Federal Reserve 

more than ministerial control, that the amount 

was in the control of the Federal Reserve to

range from zero to -- to the cap for what the 

CFPB would receive, would that change anything?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think that 

that would change the relevant constitutional

 analysis.  You might think of that as

 functioning a little bit like an agency

 overseeing a sub-agency and making

 modifications to its budget.

 In either example, Congress still 

retains a direct line in deciding how much 

funding should go to that sub-agency, and if it 

wants to change anything, there's no kind of 

double layer of insulation. 

But even if the Court thought that 

maybe having that kind of more than ministerial 

process would create some kind of novel 

constitutional question, of course, here, it's 

important to emphasize that the Federal Reserve 

Board just has this ministerial role and it 

doesn't exercise any supervision.

 General.

 So I'm concerned that there might be

 burden-shifting happening in the way in which 

we're thinking about this, and so maybe you can 

help me just to keep the -- the right burdens 

in the right place. 

Some of the questions that have been

 asked this morning are -- seem to be requiring 

you to establish whether or not Congress can do 

certain things, can -- you know, what if 

Congress, you know, delegated the authority to 

-- to determine a trillion dollars worth of 

funding and how the agency was going to do it? 

What if Congress set it up in this way or that 

way, et cetera? 

But I sort of thought that the burden 

was on them to show that Congress can't set up 

the agency in this way, and the reason I think 

that is because of the language of the 

Appropriations Clause and the way in which it 

seems to give the legislature the prerogative 

of the purse.  And, here, we have a statute in 

which the legislature has exercised that. 

So am I right that that's really all 

you need to say to win?  I mean, you don't lose

if you can't establish the limits in Congress's

 exercise of its authority, right?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that's 

right, Justice Jackson, and I think it actually

 highlights an important aspect of this case. 

You know, this is a separation of powers case. 

We are here defending a statute that Congress 

provided to fund an executive branch agency.

 And Respondents are coming in and 

asking the Article III courts to oversee and 

superintend Congress's own exercise of its 

prerogatives over the purse.  So I think 

absolutely the burden is on them to show that 

that kind of judicial intervention and 

invalidation of a statute is warranted here. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And when we get to 

them, I would assume that in determining what 

limits there are, I -- you -- you say they've 

raised certain concerns.  They say, oh, it's a 

problem with duration.  Oh, it's a problem that 

the agency has this degree of discretion, that 

the agency has this amount of power, that the 

source is coming from, the, you know, private 

individuals, et cetera, et cetera. 

But I guess their burden would have to

 somewhere in the law. I mean, it's not just up 

to us to sort of say, geez, those things seem 

problematic. We would have to find a legal

 source, I would think, in order to agree with 

them that those limits are actually imposed on

 Congress's authority.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  And, 

obviously, there are a lot of different policy 

judgments that Congress can make in thinking 

about the right way to structure funding for 

different agencies.  It's established a certain 

set of norms when it comes to financial 

regulators in particular, of which the CFPB is 

a part.  And I think that the relevant question 

here is not, is this a good way to structure an 

agency, is that a good policy?  It's does the

like, what if we found that it -- it wasn't 

necessarily, you know, set up in this way?

 Does that -- does that on its own establish

 that Congress couldn't exercise its

 prerogative?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think it 

necessarily would, and especially it wouldn't

 if one of the -- the points of novelty was

 something that had nothing to do with 

aggravating any potential separation of powers 

issue. 

And this relates back to what I was 

saying to Justice Alito, that maybe you can 

come up with distinctions, but they're not 

materially relevant to the question before the 

Court. Instead, I think, if -- if -- if there 

were truly some kind of unprecedented funding 

scheme, you'd have to ask: How does it differ 

and why does that matter?  And it's 

Respondents' burden to establish those things.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 This case is about checks and

 balances.  One of Congress's most important

 checks on executive power is its power of the

 purse. That's why Alexander Hamilton said that

 the unification of sword and purse was the very 

definition of tyranny. 

This case reflects precisely that 

feared unification.  The government agrees that 

Congress couldn't just authorize the executive 

branch to spend whatever it wants.  But that's 

effectively what Congress did here, where it 

authorized the CFPB to spend whatever it deems 

reasonably necessary in perpetuity, subject 

only to a cap so high it's almost never 

relevant, all for the very purpose of making 

this the most independent agency in American 

history. 

If it can do that, then it can 

authorize the President to spend whatever he 

deems reasonably necessary as long as he 

doesn't exceed $10 trillion, and that would

work a sea change in the separation of powers.

 The government makes two basic

 arguments in response.  First, it argues that

 that hypothetical would be unprecedented.  But 

the CFPB is also unprecedented. Congress has

 never authorized an agency to pick its own 

perpetual appropriation, and if it can do that 

for the CFPB, it can do it for every other

 agency too. 

Second, the government points to 

founding-era fee-for-services agencies like the 

Post Office and their modern analogues.  But 

none of those can demand whatever they want. 

Instead, they're limited to what they can 

collect from the people that they serve and 

regulate.  That's why Congress rejected that 

model for the CFPB.  They thought it made the 

agency too politically accountable. 

And if you jump the shark from those 

to this, then you have blessed a regime in 

which Congress can authorize the executive 

branch to spend whatever it wants to fund the 

entire government. 

In short, the Court should hold the 

line where it stands.  Otherwise, it will have

 prevent.

 I'm happy to answer Your Honor's

 questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Francisco, the --

the -- it would be -- I think it would be

 helpful -- this is a -- a -- an Appropriations 

Clause case, and you seem to suggest there's a

powers issues, non-delegation issues, without 

telling us precisely how it does -- how we run 

into that problem --

MR. FRANCISCO:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- and what the 

constitutional problem is. So we need a finer 

point. 

I get your point that this is 

different, that it's unique, that it's odd, 

that they've never gone this far.  But that's 

-- not having gone this far is not a 

constitutional problem.  It may be a problem 

with analogues, but it doesn't --

And I think we just need you to give us a finer

 point than we've had.

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure.  At a bare 

minimum, the Appropriations Clause requires

 Congress to determine how much the government

 should be spending. That's the core element of 

an appropriation. That's why I think everybody 

agrees that Congress can't simply say to the

 President:  Spend whatever you want. 

But if -- but -- but this is 

functionally no different when you're saying to 

an agency, spend whatever you want in 

perpetuity as long as you don't exceed a number 

so high it's almost never relevant.  I think 

that's why this unique constellation of factors 

is so uniquely problematic --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, 

Mr. Francisco --

MR. FRANCISCO:  -- because --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I'm sorry --

where do you get that from?  So you said the 

definition is what now?

element of an appropriation is that Congress 

has to, at a minimum, determine the amount that

 judgment.  If you simply delegate to the

 executive the authority to make that front-line 

determination, the spending isn't in

 consequence of Congress's determination.

 And the third does turn to history and

 purpose.  The whole point of separating the 

sword from the purse is to protect individual

 liberty.  If you allow Congress to essentially

 "sums not exceeding" --

Scalia, in Clinton, said the constitutionality 

of such appropriations has never seriously been 

questioned.

 argument, and, secondly, I don't think it's

 been decisively rejected by history.

 I think the problem, when you combine

 a delegation to the executive to pick his own 

appropriation in perpetuity, subject to a 

number that's so high it's almost never been

 hit, the problem with that combination of 

factors is because it uniquely essentially

 gives away the appropriations power. 

If you can do that for one agency, you 

can do it for every agency.  And then Congress 

can effectively --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry --

MR. FRANCISCO:  -- say to the 

executive --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, can we -- can 

we just sort of -- I mean, this is $600 

million, and this is a rounding error in the 

federal budget, honestly.  Six hundred million 

dollars and says up to $600 million, I mean, 

you say, oh, it's -- it's impossible to need 

it. I mean, at the CFPB, it's a pretty new 

agency, and, presumably, its regulatory 

programs are going to develop over time. 

MR. FRANCISCO:  Mm-hmm.

asking for large amounts and rolling over a

 good chunk of that into their endowment.  But

 I'll -- I'll put that to the side.

 When you look at the caps, I think you 

have to look at it both from the back end and 

the front end. On the back end, I think most

 of us seem to agree -- and I think sort of the

 government agrees -- that there has to be some 

kind of upper limit, and if there is an upper 

limit, it's got to be meaningful.  The fact 

that they've never actually hit that upper 

limit is pretty good evidence that it's not 

that meaningful a limit. 

But I think the other thing you have 

to look at it is from the front end --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe it's good 

evidence that the CFPB should be doing more. 

MR. FRANCISCO:  Well, Your Honor, 

that's -- that's when I think you also have to 

look at it from the front end.  And from the 

front end, the question is, has Congress made a 

determination as to what the executive branch 

or the CFPB should be spending?

 with this type of regime.

 Remember, the problem from the 

dissenter's perspective in Gundy was that under 

SORNA, the Attorney General had the authority 

to set sex offender requirements anywhere 

between zero requirements on the one hand and a 

very real statutory maximum on the other, the 

requirements that applied to post-Act offenders 

but otherwise gave him broad discretion between 

the polls.

 respect -- Justice Barrett, with respect to 

your question, when it comes to delegation, I

 think it's particularly problematic with

 respect to the Appropriations Clause.

 Remember, the Appropriations Clause isn't in 

Section 8 of Article I, it's in Section 9 of

 Article I.

 So it is both a -- it is not just a 

privilege of Congress, it's an obligation and a 

duty that Congress has to check the executive 

branch.  And if it can simply transfer to the 

executive its duty to check the executive, you 

are unifying the sword and purse. 

So, to the extent that there's any 

delegation allowed in the context of setting 

the amount of the appropriation, it's got to be 

a very narrow one.  And that is a perfect 

explanation for the founding-era "sums not 

exceeding" statutes. 

Those were statutes where Congress, in 

an annual appropriation, fixed the amount that 

it thought that the government should be 

spending based on Hamilton's detailed

Congress got it wrong in one year, it could fix

 it in the next year.

 That is, again, why I think that this 

unique constellation of factors is so uniquely 

problematic.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But -- but you

 concede that standing appropriations aren't

 per se unconstitutional.  So you're saying 

Congress could fix it in the next year.  But 

how long -- how long before a standing 

appropriation becomes a problem? 

MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure, Your Honor. 

I -- I would not concede that a -- a -- a -- a 

long-term standing appropriation would be 

constitutional.  I think non-delegation 

principles generally recognize some play in the 

joints. 

I actually think it would be 

problematic to simply delegate to the executive 

for one year to pick its own number within a 

broad band of discretion, but I don't have to 

defend that position because, here, we've got 

the entire opposite end of the spectrum.  This 

is a perpetual delegation to pick your own 

number within a very broad range of discretion

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Sorry.  What --

change it. But Congress could change it 

tomorrow and there's nothing perpetual or 

permanent or -- that -- about this. 

MR. FRANCISCO:  So I -- I think it's 

entrenched, Your Honor, in the sense that I 

think maybe the Chief Justice was referring to. 

Once Congress gives it over to the 

executive and expands executive power, you've 

now given, you know, a coequal branch of 

government a large amount of your power and you 

need to claw it back. 

You can't claw it back through an 

ordinary law.  You can only claw it back 

through either convincing the President himself 

to give up presidential power, something you've 

given to him, which is tough to do, or you've

 we change the CFPB funding structure, they

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure, Your Honor, they

up power to another agency, you've suddenly 

flipped the baseline for getting it back. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.

look so favorably upon the CFPB, and they 

wanted to insulate a future CFPB from political

 pressure from a future Congress, and that's

 precisely why they adopted the funding regime

 that they adopted.

 But future Congresses are supposed to 

have the ability to check the President through

 a continuing power of the purse. It's meant to

 be a continuing check on executive power. 

And to come back to the fundamental 

problem of the transfer of that front-line 

determination to the executive branch, to the 

director, as far as this statute is concerned, 

I will even concede for the sake of argument 

that wide band is a meaningful one. 

Within that band, if the director 

picks $150 million or $600 million, it's 

perfectly fine from Congress's perspective 

because Congress simply said to the Board:  You 

make that determination. 

And that top-line number isn't even a 

real number because they can further evade it 

by building out this continuing endowment that

it -- it does seem to me that your argument is

 essentially that what the Appropriations Clause 

demands is annual line-item appropriations,

 that that's the -- not just the paradigm

 appropriation but the only constitutionally

 valid kind of appropriations and that any

 deviation from that needs some special

 justification or maybe is just, like, 

unconstitutional per se. I'm not exactly sure 

what the argument is. 

But the history of our country just 

rejects that scheme.  I mean, that might have 

been a way to understand what the Framers were 

doing, but it turns out that from the very 

first year, that's not what they were doing. 

That's not what they did.  Annual line-item 

appropriations were some appropriations but 

massively not all appropriations.

thing, Your Honor, is I would like to address 

the Customs Service because my understanding of

 it is not the same as my friend's understanding

 of it.

 As I understood the -- understand the 

Customs Service at the time of the founding, it 

was actually funded through fees that it 

collected as part of the collection of customs, 

and Congress set those formulas. Congress 

determined what fees they could collect or what 

formula they could use to collect those fees. 

And, in addition, it was supervised by 

the Department of the Treasury, which it was 

itself subject to annual appropriations.  So I 

-- I don't think it was a standing 

appropriation. 

Now it was a standing appropriation 

between 1849 and 1912. There was a $1.5 

million standing appropriation.  But two things 

about that.  It was still subject to the 

supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury, 

and that turned out not to be enough.  They had 

to generally go back for regular 

appropriations.  Now that's at least how I 

understand the history of the Customs Service.

In terms of what the standard is, I

 think our front-line rule is, at a minimum,

 Congress has to determine the amount.  And the 

reason I'm focusing on the factors that I'm 

focusing on is because, when you bring those

 factors together, you have really exploded any

 limitation at all.

 And I think it's enough to say that

 when you delegate to the executive the 

authority to pick its own numbers, subject only 

to a cap that's so high it's rarely relevant, 

and if not perpetually, at least for a -- a 

long period of time, you have uniquely brought 

together a set of factors that does allow 

Congress to essentially transfer its 

appropriations power to the executive branch 

for an indefinite period of time, and you just 

have to multiply that across the agencies to 

see why that's so dangerous.  We don't --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It sure seems that on 

your view, the Federal Reserve would also be 

unconstitutional.  Why -- why or why not?

and as I think then-Judge Kavanaugh suggested 

on the D.C. Circuit, the Federal Reserve is

 pretty much sui generis.  I think it reflects

 the fact that at the time of the founding, the

 core functions of the Fed, controlling the

 money supply through open market transactions,

 weren't really considered governmental

 functions at all.  That's why --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So there's also a 

governmental function component of your test? 

MR. FRANCISCO:  Well, no, Your Honor. 

I mean, if it's not --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because you state a

that clearly fails under that test, you say, 

oh, no, I don't mean that. 

MR. FRANCISCO:  No, because, for the 

Fed, remember, the First and Second National 

Banks were organized as private banks.  To this 

day, the presidents of the private regional 

reserve banks sit on the Federal Open Markets 

Committee, and it's also why I think that if

generality, I thought there was agreement on 

what the limiting principle was, and that was a 

comparison of the setup that is before us with 

historical practice. 

And I don't think there's anything 

unusual about asking counsel in cases that come 

before us for the limiting principle of the 

argument that they're making.  That's a basic 

question that we ask. I don't think it's a 

question of burden-shifting.

 embracing a much broader argument that I think 

was posed by Justice Jackson's questions, and 

that is whether the Appropriations Clause is 

satisfied so long as Congress adopts any law 

that says that you, Agency, you get money in

 this way.  So long as that there's any law that 

does that, that's consistent with the

 Appropriations Clause.

 Now the Solicitor General on rebuttal 

can clarify whether she thinks that's the 

correct test that we should apply or whether 

it's the one that I had previously thought she 

was advocating, which looks to whether 

something falls far outside Congress's 

historical practices. 

So could you comment on this broad 

"any law" argument and, in particular, answer 

the question whether the Appropriations Clause 

would have any meaning if that broad 

interpretation were adopted?

 Congress has to make an appropriation.  It's 

got to determine what the government should be

 spending.  It's got to determine the amount 

that it should be spending.

 And it's got a non-delegation

 component baked into it because you cannot

 simply transfer that core legislative function 

to the executive branch. And that's why I 

think that even if you, you know, put the issue 

of a cap aside, even if you think that this is 

a meaningful band of discretion, it's an 

extraordinarily wide band of discretion that

$400 million or the amount should be $600

 million, I would -- that would be a much more

 difficult case for me.

 But, when Congress is doing what it

 did here, it's saying to the director:  You 

pick the amount that you think is reasonably

 necessary.  It could be zero.  It could be $750

 million.

 It's taking that core element of an 

appropriation, determining the amount that the 

government should be spending, and it's saying 

we, Congress, are not going to exercise that 

judgment, we're kicking that over to you, the 

executive branch, to exercise that judgment. 

And that is what's so problematic and 

is what is so also historically unprecedented 

if we're going to use precedent as the test. 

The only counter-examples tend to be these 

self-funding agencies, the Post Office, the 

Patent Office, their modern-day analogues. 

Well, they don't get to pick their amount 

because they're different in a meaningful 

sense. They're limited to what they can 

collect from the people they regulate and 

serve.

And there's a historical tradition for 

those types of agencies, but that history tells

 us a couple of other things too. It's never

 been extended beyond that group of agencies. 

That model was rejected for the CFPB. That was 

actually the model that President Obama

 proposed for the CFPB, but Congress rejected it 

because it wanted to make this agency even more

 independent. 

And, finally, if you do think that's 

the model, there really is no limit because 

those agencies don't even have a cap. So 

Congress could just say to every agency:  Spend 

whatever you think reasonably appropriate, you 

make the front-line judgment within this very 

broad range of discretion in something maybe 

not quite perpetual but close to it.

 to the director the authority to pick his own

advocating, and you just addressed your answer

the government's limiting principle, whether it 

is adopting the argument that any law -- any 

law suffices or whether it requires us to look 

at historical examples and see whether there's 

anything that's at least roughly analogous to 

what is before us, whether what is before us 

goes far beyond anything that Congress has done 

in the past.

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Yeah.  Your Honor, in 

a way, I don't think that this argument really

 stands on its own terms because, if we're

 right, then this does have to go back to 

Congress for a valid appropriation. 

And when Congress adopts a valid 

appropriation, it can ratify whatever rules and 

regulations it wants to ratify, and if it 

doesn't ratify them, it pays the political 

price for that choice too. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. So 

tell me which parts of the law or which part of 

this structure you would strike down. 

MR. FRANCISCO: The funding 

provisions, the -- the provision that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So should they say

your legal functioning, your experts, whatever

would be far beyond anything the Court's ever 

done in the severability world.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Two, Your Honor, you 

would be adopting a funding stream, a -- a

 standing appropriation at an amount higher than

 this agency has never needed before.  That's

 something that Congress has never done. As far 

as I know, never done. 

And so you would essentially -- you 

know, the whole point of severability is to try 

to mirror legislative intent.  Why on earth 

would you adopt a funding stream that Congress 

has never even considered before instead of 

just simply saying to Congress: It's now back 

in your court, you need to make a valid 

appropriation. 

And if you need to stay your judgment 

for a period of time, as you did in the 

Northern Pipeline case, to facilitate that, we 

certainly have no objection to that.  But --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- ask my question?

 Because, when you talked to Justice

 Thomas, you said that the "because," what 

followed the "because," was that it was an up 

to X rather than a specification of a number, 

no more, no less.

 So, if that's right, then it must be

 right that Congress could take this back and 

say you have to spend $600 million, and that 

would be constitutional.  And what I would 

suggest to you is that's what your argument is, 

and that's profoundly ahistorical in terms of 

our history. 

MR. FRANCISCO:  So a -- a couple of 

responses, Your Honor, and -- and I don't want 

to quibble with the premise of the question, 

but I think that when I listed out my standard 

to Justice Thomas, one of the factors was the 

fact that this was perpetual.  I'll -- I'll put 

that entirely to the side. 

If Congress does make a standing 

appropriation of $600 million, at a bare 

minimum, it will have made a determination as 

to what the government should be spending, and

so I would have a much harder time arguing

 against that alone.

 I don't think that that type of thing

 is historically precedented.  Outside of the

 self-funding agencies like the Post Office and 

their modern analogues, I'm not aware of any 

agency that has been subjected to a standing

 appropriation for its operating budget, much

 less one that's done -- been subject to that 

kind of standing appropriation in perpetuity at 

a number that's higher than they actually need. 

The closest I can think of throughout 

history is the Customs Service from 1849 to 

1912, where they had a $1.5 million standing 

appropriation, but they were, one, subject to 

the supervision of the Secretary of the 

Treasury, who received regular appropriations, 

and, two, that amount wasn't even enough, which 

is why it went back for regular appropriations.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes.  So I think 

I've heard you say repeatedly that the problem 

here is that Congress is giving away the power 

of the purse in the way that it has set this

 up.

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is that your

 fundamental bottom-line problem with this?

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay. And I guess 

my answer is maybe that it depends on what the 

power of the purse is in order for us to know 

whether or not it's being given away.  And so 

I'm thinking of these two separate scenarios, 

and -- and maybe -- I don't know if this is 

helpful, but I'd like to get your reaction. 

So, in Scenario Number 1, we have a 

Constitution that gives the legislature the 

power of the purse, and it specifies what that 

authority entails.  It says:  To exercise the 

power of the purse, you have to select a fixed 

sum of money on an annual basis and tell the 

recipient exactly how it must be spent.

agency structure is giving up that power 

because, in fact, those determinations about 

how much is being spent and et cetera would be 

given to the agency, and the Constitution tells 

us that the legislature has to exercise that

 authority.

 My problem is Scenario 2, which is the

 Constitution giving the legislature the power 

of the purse, and it defines the power of the 

purse as the power to decide how government 

departments are funded, period.  That's what 

the Constitution says. It's got a definition 

section, and it says, when we say "power of the 

purse," we mean you have the ability to decide 

how the government is funded. 

If that's your constitutional 

provision, I think you have a harder -- harder 

time, if not almost an impossible time, 

convincing me at least that by setting this 

agency up this way in which Congress has --

MR. FRANCISCO:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- exercised that 

authority by deciding this is how the CFPB is 

going to be funded, that they have actually 

given up or, you know, ceded that authority --

 fact, they've exercised it pursuant to my

Constitution is more like Scenario 2, and so, 

therefore, if that's true, don't you lose on 

this fundamental conception of you've given

 away your authority? 

MR. FRANCISCO: Your Honor, if that 

were truly the conception embodied in the 

Appropriations Clause, then the answer to your 

question is yes. But, if that is truly the 

conception, then there really are no limits on 

the appropriations power.  Congress can say --

that a problem?  If that's the conception, 

that's what Scenario 2 says --

nothing in this Constitution that's like 

Scenario 1, like the Army Clause, where 

Congress -- where -- where the Framers have 

specifically restricted the exercise of 

authority that they're giving to Congress. 

So what I need to find out from you is 

why we are not in Scenario 2 given the language

Appropriations Clause has been handled.  Why

MR. FRANCISCO:  Mm-hmm.

          JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- so be it?

 MR. FRANCISCO:  Because, Your Honor, I

inconsistent with the entire purpose of 

separating the sword and purse, which Hamilton 

said, if you were to combine the two, would 

furnish one body with all the means of tyranny, 

which Madison said was the most complete and 

effectual weapon --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But can I ask you 

why is that necessarily the case?  Congress 

could, as Justice Kavanaugh keeps saying, take 

it back.  Congress is getting reports in this 

situation about what's happening.  So, if 

Congress says, for the foreseeable future, what 

we would like to have happen is for this agency 

to get this amount of money and spend it on 

these general purposes, period, why is that, 

you know, risking the kind of tyranny that you 

suddenly seem to think is -- is the issue here?

you're suggesting it means, I'm wrong.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MR. FRANCISCO:  I'm simply saying that 

that cannot possibly be what the Appropriations

 Clause means because, if it were, then the game 

is really over. One Congress can simply say to

 one President in one fell swoop: 

Mr. President, it's up to you, spend whatever

 you want. 

And what Madison thought was so 

dangerous, what Hamilton thought was so 

dangerous, would actually be precisely what the 

Constitution allows, the unification --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, of course, 

that's not what's happening in this case, 

right? I mean, I think that's -- the -- the 

Solicitor's argument is maybe if we had 

anything close to that, the Court would 

consider whether or not tyranny is afoot. 

But, for this particular scenario, 

there is -- there are the kinds of checks that 

you would expect to see in terms of Congress's 

exercise of its power.

Honor. One, structures don't crumble in a day,

first very substantial step in the crumbling of

 Secondly, if you adopt the theory 

you're suggesting, then it's not really the

 structures.  You've simply announced -- you --

you've -- you've -- you've simply announced

think, about the separation of powers problem

How do we avoid the judiciary becoming suddenly 

a supra legislator, just telling, you know,

 the -- the Congress agency by agency whether 

it's a thumbs up or thumbs down from our 

perspective about these things? I mean, where

 are these -- these limits in the law --

MR. FRANCISCO:  The -- the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- that prevents us

 from overstepping our authority? 

MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure, Your Honor.  And 

the judiciary has always played a vital role in 

policing the separation of powers, because the 

whole point is not to protect Congress from the 

President or President from the Congress, it's 

to protect the liberty of the people. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But where 

are the limits that we have in order to do 

that? We've got to police relative to some set 

of rules. 

MR. FRANCISCO:  Sure, Your Honor.

coming from? 

MR. FRANCISCO:  And that's exactly

appropriation was understood in the Founding

 Era. It was defined as the act of assigning

 something to a particular use.  It required the

 specification of source and purpose, never a

 specific sum.

 And if there were any debate about

 that point, the 230-plus years of this nation's

 history conclusively resolves it because the

 very first Congress appropriated without 

specifying a fixed sum. 

The first act that it enacted that was 

an appropriation specified up to a particular 

cap of spending that was authorized, that's 

just how the CFPB's funding mechanism is 

structured today, and there have been countless 

appropriations that look like this throughout 

history. 

My friend's theory would have sweeping 

consequences.  Even today, in the 2022 

Consolidated Appropriations Act, we counted 

more than 400 uses of this kind of discretion 

to spend up to a specified cap. 

And Congress has regularly enacted 

appropriations that define the amount in terms 

of purpose.  The funds necessary for Social

Security or for the Judgment Fund or to pay 

interest on the national debt, that is not a 

historical outlier. It is the norm in

 appropriations law.

 My friend turns to suggesting that the 

cap here is illusory. At the outset, I haven't

 heard any standard that would judicial -- be

 judicially manageable for courts to apply to 

try to make those judgments. 

This is again a case about Congress's 

power over the purse.  It's chosen a number. 

It's enacted a cap.  And I don't know what 

basis courts would have to say that's too high, 

that's not a meaningful constraint, Congress 

should have set it lower.  And I think that 

that is a real problem with their theory at the 

outset. 

But even if the Court engaged with it, 

it's not factually accurate here to say this 

isn't a meaningful constraint.  Congress, when 

it chose the $600 million figure, said that 

this was modest compared to other agencies' 

budgets. 

It was attempting to estimate the 

amount in the Federal Reserve System combined

earnings that had been previously spent on

 consumer protection.  And, in fact, if you look 

at the CFPB's funding requests over the years, 

it's come closer and closer to the cap. I -- I

 think the most recent fiscal year, the CFPB was 

only $30 million below the cap. So, if that

 trajectory continues, it's very likely the CFPB 

is going to have to go to Congress and ask for

 additional appropriations authority. 

My friend also suggested that there 

was something constitutionally suspicious about 

standing appropriations.  But I didn't hear any 

engagement with the text of the Army 

Appropriations Clause. 

The Framers thought about this issue. 

They did want to limit Congress when it came to 

funding for the Army to create that durational 

requirement, but they wrote no other limit into 

the Constitution.  And this too would have 

sweeping consequences because today, over 

60 percent of the federal budget comes in the 

form of these kinds of standing appropriations 

that exist in every sector of the federal 

government. 

And then, at some point, I think my

friend had suggested that it's all of these

 features combined that add up to a

 constitutional problem here.

 And, Justice Alito, I want to engage

 with your question about the limits.  Our 

theory in this case is based on text and

 history. So I acknowledge that if there were, 

in fact, a funding statute that didn't look 

anything like what we've had in all of history 

and if -- and if the differences that you could 

ascertain are relevant to a potential 

separation of powers violation, that would 

count against us and it would mean that maybe 

the Court could determine that at some outer 

recess of the separation of powers a line was 

crossed. 

But we have nothing like that here. 

We have an appropriation that in all material 

respects looks like countless others that have 

existed for time immemorial since 1789 on. And 

I think that leaves my friend suggesting that 

the Court should turn away from text, the Army 

Appropriations Clause, and turn away from all 

that history and find some kind of implicit 

additional limit on Congress's authority here.

But my friend hasn't offered a

 principle the Court could apply to draw those

 limits.  With respect to whether the funding is 

too much, how is a court supposed to figure it

 out? With respect to duration, my friend says 

that some appropriations can last longer than 

two years, and I think he has to make that

 concession because of the Army Appropriations

 Clause.  But then how long is too long? And 

how is a court supposed to determine what 

functions don't count? 

He suggested that you can distinguish 

some of the other financial regulators, like 

the Federal Reserve Board, based on the 

particular functions that it carries out. 

But that's not a point of distinction 

either.  The Federal Reserve Board regulates, 

it enforces.  The other financial regulators do 

the same.  And I would point the Court to 12 

U.S.C. Section 1818 to demonstrate that these 

functions are not different. 

Nor is there any principled line here 

that the Court could apply to try to ascertain 

and weigh the relative difference of function 

between different agencies, as the Court
