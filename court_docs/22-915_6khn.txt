 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-915, United

 States versus Rahimi.

 General Prelogar.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Guns and domestic abuse are a deadly 

combination.  As this Court has said, all too 

often, the only difference between a battered 

woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun. 

Armed abusers also pose grave danger to police 

officers responding to domestic violence calls 

and to the public at large, as Zackey Rahimi's 

own conduct shows. 

To address that acute threat, Congress 

and 48 states and territories temporarily disarm 

individuals subject to domestic violence 

protective orders.  Congress designed Section 

922(g)(8) to target the most dangerous domestic 

abusers.  It applies only if, after notice and a 

hearing, a court makes an express finding that

the person poses a credible threat to an 

intimate partner's physical safety or imposes a 

specific prohibition on the use of physical 

force, and the disarmament lasts only as long as

 the order remains in effect.

 The Fifth Circuit profoundly erred in

 reading this Court's decision in Bruen to

 prohibit that widespread common-sense response

 to the deadly threat of armed domestic violence. 

Like Heller and McDonald, Bruen recognized that 

Congress may disarm those who are not 

law-abiding, responsible citizens. 

That principle is firmly grounded in 

the Second Amendment's history and tradition. 

Throughout our nation's history, legislatures 

have disarmed those who have committed serious 

criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a 

danger, for example, loyalists, rebels, minors, 

individuals with mental illness, felons, and 

drug addicts. 

Rahimi offers no historical evidence 

that those laws were thought to violate the 

right to keep and bear arms or that the Second 

Amendment was originally understood to prevent 

legislatures from disarming dangerous

 individuals.

 Despite all that, the Fifth Circuit 

held that Section 922(g)(8) is facially 

unconstitutional because the founding generation

 didn't disarm domestic abusers in particular. 

But Bruen specifically approved that kind of 

demand for a historical twin. The Fifth 

Circuit's approach departs from the Second

 Amendment's original meaning and would enact the 

very sort of regulatory straitjacket that this 

Court disclaimed in Bruen. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: General, would you 

just briefly define what you mean by 

"law-abiding and responsible"? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Of course, Justice 

Thomas.  So I would break that into its two 

constituent components.  With respect to those 

who are not law-abiding, history and tradition 

shows that that's defined by those who have 

committed serious crimes defined by the 

felony-level punishment that can attach to those 

crimes. 

This case focuses on the "not 

responsible citizens" principle, and in this

context, we think that history and tradition 

show that it applies to those whose possession

 of firearms would pose an unusual danger, beyond 

the ordinary citizen, with respect to harm to

 themselves or harm to others.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  What if someone --

this is a civil action. I think we could agree

 on the -- if this were -- these were criminal

 proceedings.  What if someone is categorized as 

irresponsible for not storing firearms properly? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that 

there would be a history and tradition to 

support the idea that if someone has improperly 

stored their firearms and thus demonstrated by 

their conduct that they're not fit to keep and 

bear arms, they would fit within this category 

of those who are not responsible.  And -- and 

there were a number of historical laws that 

operated that way, for example, those who had 

improperly stored gunpowder and caused the risk 

of explosions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Below, you in your --

you -- you had a list of classes of individuals 

who were excluded in -- in your opening 

argument.  Now below you included in that class

or in those classes slaves and Native Americans. 

Why did you drop those classes?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We haven't invoked 

those laws at this stage of the proceedings 

because we think that they speak to a distinct

 principle and the textual hook that at the 

particular point in time those categories of 

people were viewed as being not among the people 

protected by the Second Amendment in the first 

instance. 

Obviously, that was an odious 

classification, but those laws were generally 

accompanied by stripping of other political 

rights or ability to -- to participate in the 

political community, and we think they were 

justified at that time on that basis. 

And so the reason we haven't invoked 

them here is because we focused on the more 

directly relevant laws that apply to those who 

are indisputably among the people but 

nevertheless fit within this enduring 

constitutional principle that the legislature 

has authority to draw lines and make predictive 

judgments about those whose access to firearms 

will create that untenable risk of danger.

 mile-an-hour zone -- does that person qualify as

wouldn't apply under the not responsible 

category, but if you're focusing on law-abiding 

in particular, we think that history and 

tradition there support the conclusion that you 

can disarm those who have committed serious 

crimes. 

So it's not just that any kind of --

of conduct that is an offense would qualify. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- are 

you making a misdemeanor/felony distinction? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's the line 

that history and tradition reflect, and so, yes, 

I think that that is the relevant category with 

respect to law-abiding citizens. But, again, I 

would just emphasize here we're not directly 

invoking the law-abiding aspect of the principle

because Mr. Rahimi didn't have the kind of -- of 

-- of criminal record that would justify

 disarmament on that basis.  Instead, our 

arguments here are directed at the aspect of the

 standard focused on those who are not

 responsible.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  You say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Responsibility

 is a very broad concept. I mean, not taking 

your recycling to the curb on Thursdays.  I 

mean, if you're -- if it's a serious problem, 

you're -- it -- it's irresponsible.  Setting a 

bad example, you know, by yelling at a 

basketball game in a particular way. 

It seems to me that the problem with 

responsibility is that it's extremely broad, and 

what -- what seems responsible to some --

irresponsible to some people might seem like, 

well, that's not a big deal to others. 

So what is the model?  I mean, is --

is -- do you go back to what was irresponsible 

at the common law or what's -- take a poll and 

see if people think it's irresponsible, you 

know, to get into a fistfight at a -- at a, you 

know, sports event where tempers were running

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I want to be 

really clear that we're not using the term "not 

responsible" to describe colloquially anyone who

 you might describe as -- as demonstrating 

irresponsibility in many of those contexts that 

you just described in your hypotheticals.

 Instead, we read this Court's case law and, in 

particular, its articulation of that principle, 

we're tracking the Court's language here, the 

principle of responsibility, as being 

intrinsically tied to the danger you would 

present if you have access to firearms. 

And I would draw a parallel here to 

the principles the Court has articulated with 

respect to sensitive places or with dangerous 

and unusual weapons.  In each of those 

categories --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to 

be clear, you're -- you're using "responsible" 

as a placeholder for dangerous with respect to 

the use of firearms?

how we understand history and tradition in this 

context.  And the reason that we've used the

term "not responsible" is it -- it's because

 it's the own -- the standard that this Court 

itself has articulated in Heller and repeated in 

McDonald and then repeated again in Bruen.

 I think probably the reason the Court 

has used the term "not responsible" is it gets 

at the idea that some of the categories of 

people who can be disarmed might not intend to

 be dangerous.  They might not be culpable in 

that sense, like the mentally ill or minors, and 

so I think responsibility gets at the idea that 

they might not actually intend to be a danger 

but, in fact, would present the danger --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So there's no --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- if they had 

firearms. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- no daylight at 

all then between not responsible and dangerous? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  With respect 

to responsibility in particular, our 

understanding of what history and tradition 

reflect and how this Court has used the term is 

that it's identifying those whose possession of 

firearms presents an unusual danger beyond the 

ordinary citizen.

And, again, I would draw the -- the 

analogy to sensitive places and to dangerous and

 unusual weapons.  In each of these contexts, the

 Court is trying to identify those arms that are

 especially dangerous, those places where

 carrying weapons will pose unique dangers, and

 those categories of people who, beyond the

 ordinary citizen, possess a -- a particular

 danger if they have access to firearms. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So it's not a 

synonym for virtue? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. We're not 

invoking a --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  It's not -- you're 

not pulling in the virtuous citizenry? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We are not, no.  We 

think that here there is a direct link under the 

responsible citizens principle to danger, and we 

think that the disarmament provision I'm 

defending here, Section 922(g)(8), clearly 

satisfies that link because it requires 

individualized findings of dangerousness and a 

legislative consensus that individuals in this 

category present the requisite level of danger. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, then how do

you know?  I mean, I think there would be little 

dispute that someone who was guilty, say, or 

even had a restraining order -- that domestic

 violence is dangerous, okay.  So someone who

 poses a risk of domestic violence is dangerous.

 How does the government go about

 showing whether certain behavior qualifies as 

dangerous? Because this might be in a 

heartland, but then you can imagine more 

marginal cases. 

So you've invoked the consensus among 

the states, tradition of dangerousness, and I 

don't think you'd get a lot of push-back because 

this is violence after all, domestic violence. 

What about more marginal cases? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that the 

factors we think courts could apply in this 

context -- and I should emphasize that this is 

subject to meaningful judicial review -- would 

fall into a couple of different categories. 

At the outset, I would take the class 

of disarmament provisions that require 

individualized findings of dangerousness and say 

those fall in the heartland, as you just 

suggested.  We have a judicial order here that

 dangerous to his intimate partner.

 Then I think you get to the category 

of cases where a legislature might be making

 categorical predictive judgments that 

individuals with a certain characteristic or 

quality or past conduct present a danger, and

 those, I think, can be harder cases.

 But the factors I would point to first 

would be the breadth of the law, because we know 

that the Second Amendment was entire -- was 

intended to prevent disarming wide swaths of the 

American public.  So, if it's sweeping broadly 

or indiscriminately and capturing people we 

think of as ordinary citizens, that's going to 

be a problem. 

Next, I would look at the 

justifications and the evidence before the 

legislature.  This would operate like sensitive 

places.  You could look and see is that place, 

in fact, dangerous if there are weapons there. 

So too you could look at the evidence the 

legislature was consulting with respect to its 

judgment of dangerousness. 

And then the third factor would be

that legislative consensus.  And I don't want to 

suggest that this is dispositive either way

 because some legislatures can be the first 

mover, and if multiple legislatures enact an 

unconstitutional law, that doesn't give you a 

safe harbor, but I do think that legislatures 

are best positioned to make these kinds of 

predictive judgments about dangerousness, and if 

you have the kind of consensus that we see here 

with respect to Section 922(g)(8), that's 

entitled to a lot of weight in the analysis. 

And I don't want to say, Justice 

Barrett, that this is always going to be easy 

and that these factors will cash out in obvious 

ways. I would say that I think that this is not 

a close case and that Section 922(g)(8) is 

clearly constitutional and fits within the 

category of disarming irresponsible citizens 

under these principles.

 generality of dangerousness.  I -- I wonder 

whether we need to be taking into account how 

historically domestic violence in particular was

 treated so that if we had evidence that, you

 know, men who engaged in domestic violence 

historically were actually not perceived as then

 dangerous from the standpoint of -- of

 disarmament, what -- what -- what -- what would

 we do with that in this situation? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I don't think 

that historical attitudes about dangerousness 

would be controlling with respect to modern-day 

circumstances, and I would draw an analogy here 

to dangerous and unusual weapons. 

You know, the Court has recognized, 

for example, that handguns were not in common 

possession at the time of the founding and might 

have been considered unusual weapons then.  But 

that's not what the Court would look at for 

determining whether you could ban handguns 

today. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: But is that just 

because that's a new technology? I mean, the --

the circumstance with respect to domestic 

violence clearly existed back in the day, and

the question I guess -- I -- I'm just trying to 

understand how the Bruen test works in a 

situation in which there is at least some 

evidence that domestic violence was not

 considered to be, you know, subject to the kinds

 of regulation that it is today.

 And so, when we're looking under that 

test for historical analogues, I guess, you 

know, a series of regulations that relate to 

disarming dangerous people, I -- I -- I need to 

understand why that would be enough. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: Well, so let me try 

to respond to the methodological point, and then 

I want to respond to the specific questions 

you've raised about how domestic violence was 

treated at the founding and today. 

On the methodological point, I don't 

think that you could read Bruen to suggest that 

we need regulations that specifically disarm 

domestic abusers because that would be coming 

dangerously close to imposing on the government 

the requirement for an identical twin of a 

regulation. 

And, of course, original meaning isn't 

dictated by the happenstance of whether there

point of going to the Founding Era?  I mean, I 

thought it was doing some work. But, if we're

 still applying modern sensibilities, I don't

 really understand the historical framing.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The work that

 history and tradition are doing is helping to 

discern those principles in the first place. 

The idea, for example, that you can ban firearms 

in sensitive places, the fact is that the 

Framers didn't ban firearms in schools even 

though they existed at the Founding, but the 

Court has already recognized that those 

analogues and the historic banning of firearms 

in places where they present safety concerns can 

justify a modern-day regulation that does 

require the banning of weapons in schools. 

And so too here, I think the Court can 

identify the constitutional principle, which 

it's already articulated -- we're not asking the 

Court to break new ground here -- and say today, 

Section 922(g)(8) is a clear application of that 

principle that you can disarm dangerous people. 

And, Justice Jackson, I do want to 

push back on the idea and the premise of your 

question that there was evidence at the

 Founding, for example, that you couldn't disarm

 domestic abusers.  It's true that the Founders 

didn't do that, but there's no evidence to 

suggest that they would have thought that that

 crossed a constitutional line.

 And the fact that domestic violence 

was subject to a very different legal and 

societal regime at the time and was not viewed 

as the kind of system that warrants systematic 

governmental interference, I think, can't be 

held against us now that we're looking at how 

Congress is reacting to the profound threats 

that armed domestic violence presents. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  General, one 

provision, one section of the provision at issue 

here, applies when a court order includes a 

finding that the person represents "a credible 

threat to the physical safety of such intimate 

partner or child." 

But another provision applies when the 

order "by its terms explicitly prohibits the 

use, attempted use, or threatened use of 

physical force...".  that does not require a 

finding of dangerousness.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think,

 ultimately, a court would have to find 

dangerousness to enter a subparagraph (c)(2) 

injunction based on the general equitable 

principle that in order to enjoin conduct, you

 have to think that conduct is reasonably likely

 to occur.

 This is a universal equitable 

principle.  It certainly applies in Texas and in 

virtually all of the states.  And I think what 

it means is that a -- a judge who's considering 

a request for a protective order wouldn't have a 

basis in law to enter that subparagraph (c)(2) 

prohibition on the use of physical force unless 

the judge thought the force was sufficiently 

likely to materialize. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, we are told in 

some of the amicus briefs that there are 

situations in which the family court judge who 

has to act quickly and may not have any 

investigative resources faces a he/she -- a he 

said/she said situation, and the judge just 

says: Well, I'm going to issue an order like 

this against both of the parties.

Do you agree that that occurs?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. I think that 

that is largely a mischaracterization of what is

 happening in the -- the state courts day in and

 day out.  With respect to mutual protective

 orders in particular, the vast majority of

 states -- we cite a source that counts 48 of

 them -- either prohibit outright or

 substantially restrict the entry of those kinds 

of mutual protective orders. 

And then I think the account is 

basically trying to suggest or insinuate that 

these state courts are nevertheless entering 

protective orders that are not justified by the 

facts and the law, and that just flies in the 

face of the presumption of regularity that this 

Court applies in this context. 

Even the data on the ground don't bear 

out the assertions that family courts are just 

reflexively entering these kinds of protective 

orders.  By Respondent's own count in the 

particular Tarrant County statistics he 

collected, there were 522 requests for 

protective orders, but that only resulted in 289 

final protective orders.

So I think, even as a statistical

 matter, it's incorrect to say that, invariably, 

these orders are being entered without any basis 

in fact or law to justify them.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there anything that 

a person who is subject to one of these orders

 can do if the person claims that there wasn't 

really sufficient notice or that due process 

rights were violated in some way or that any 

need for the protective order has expired? 

Presumably, the person could go back 

to the state court that entered the order. But, 

if the state court is completely unreceptive to 

that, is there any other avenue for relief? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think it's 

important to parse out different aspects of the 

question.  Certainly, in a Section 922(g)(8) 

prosecution, an individual could challenge the 

adequacy of the notice or the hearing.  And so, 

if the argument is I didn't actually receive the 

notice or I didn't have an opportunity to 

participate, that would be a -- a defense 

because Section 922(g)(8) requires that. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  But --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- before the fact --

so the person -- the person thinks that he or 

she is in danger and wants to have a firearm.

 Is the person's only recourse to possess the

 firearm and take -- you know, take their chances 

if they get prosecuted?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. I mean, I

 think the person would obviously have an ability 

to, within the state court system, challenge the 

entry of the protective order.  But I don't 

think there would be any basis to say you could 

collaterally challenge that in the federal 

prosecution.  And, ultimately, this just 

reflects the -- the history and tradition 

demonstrating that there are certain categories 

of people where we don't have to tolerate the 

risks of armed domestic violence that they would 

present, even in situations where they might 

claim that they need to have a gun for other 

reasons. 

JUSTICE ALITO: There's no recourse 

before the fact in federal court? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that

the opportunity for a hearing.  But, if a court 

has entered a protective order that complies 

with the restrictions in 922(g)(8), then a 

federal court can rely on that in enforcing this

 prohibition.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any

 possibility of administrative relief?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that at the 

state level, there are certain mechanisms in 

place where people can seek relief.  And one 

important thing to emphasize is that these 

protective orders are inherently time-limited. 

It varies a little bit at the state 

level. I've seen provisions that authorize the 

imposition of these protective orders for six 

months up to about five years.  I think, most 

commonly, they're in effect for just one year. 

But, you know -- and the federal firearms 

prohibition tracks the length and duration of 

the protective order, so that also, I think, 

means that the -- the disarmament lasts only so 

long as the danger is in effect. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, one more 

question.  The Alameda County Public Defenders' 

amicus brief says that some restraining orders

true, how do you justify a permanent prohibition

 even if the -- any danger has disappeared?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I'm not aware of

 state law authority to -- to -- that authorizes 

or that routinely enters permanent protective

 orders.  As I mentioned, this is -- varies 

across state law, so I don't want to suggest 

that there's a universal answer here, but these 

orders are generally time-limited or provide 

mechanisms for courts to go back and review the 

finding of dangerousness for purposes of 

effectuating the -- the basic command of the 

protective order.

constitutionality of this statute is what's at

 issue?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, and the Fifth

 Circuit invalidated the statute on its face. I 

do want to suggest that to the extent the Court 

has been left with the impression in some of 

these amicus briefs that the protective orders

 are routinely entered -- are routinely entered

 without a basis to conclude that someone 

actually presents the individualized finding of 

danger, I do not think there is any record or 

evidence to support that conclusion here. 

And I would say, again, this runs 

counter to the presumption of regularity that 

the Court ordinarily affords in this context, 

but I think it also runs counter to Congress's 

recognition and circumscribing of Section 

922(g)(8) to ensure that it's covering those who 

had notice and an opportunity for a hearing and, 

therefore --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'd -- I'd like to

 go back to your law-abiding or responsible

 citizen category.  I now understand why you

 think it's -- it's appropriate.  You think 

"dangerous" is too limited because we have 

restrictions on the age of people possessing 

firearms and on the mentally ill, and they're 

not -- why do you -- and -- and I understand 

they're not necessarily dangerous, but I guess 

their lack of responsibility or judgment could 

be questioned, correct? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  What I would say is 

we think that they are inherently dangerous,

intending to create that kind of danger with 

firearms. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if we use 

"danger" in the way you're defining it, as 

broadly as you're defining it, you don't need

 responsible citizen category?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I think these

 are essentially getting at the same concept.  I

 guess what I would say, Justice Sotomayor, is 

that we have tracked the Court's own language 

here. And I think it would be important, if the 

Court wants to refer to concepts of 

dangerousness, to make clear that it's not 

backtracking from what it said in Heller and in 

McDonald and in Bruen, that you can disarm those 

who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens, 

with the mentally ill as one of the exemplar 

categories the Court held up to illustrate that 

proposition. 

And I think that the term 

"responsible" gets at the -- the broader group 

of people who can be disarmed even though they 

might not be culpable precisely because of this 

risk of danger.  But, if the Court --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can you finish

 that answer?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I was going to say 

but, if the Court were to refer to these 

concepts of dangerousness, I just think it would 

be important to make clear that it's not 

backtracking from what it has said in prior 

cases. And it's not just that the Court has 

referred to this concept in the abstract. It's 

actually embedded it in various aspects of how 

Second Amendment analysis operates. 

So, for example, the Court has said 

background checks are okay because they're 

intended to decide whether you're the kind of 

ordinary, law-abiding, responsible citizen in 

the first place, or that when you're looking at 

whether a weapon is dangerous and unusual, you 

should ask is this the kind of weapon that a 

law-abiding, responsible citizen would need for 

self-defense.

 counsel.  I -- I guess, to get back to the

 beginning, so why did you use the term

 "responsible" if what you meant was dangerous?

 I mean, "responsible" presents all 

sorts of problems, and "dangerous" is sort of a

 different set of considerations. I mean, if you 

thought that our prior precedents were talking

 about dangerous, it was a little confusing to 

all of a sudden find "responsible" being the 

operative term. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, we relied on 

the same phrasing the Court itself used when it 

first articulated this -- this constitutional 

principle in Heller.  And so I think we were 

trying to point out that the Court itself has 

already recognized the category of regulation 

that's consistent with original meaning under 

the Second Amendment, and we just followed the 

Court's lead in using that phrase, those who are 

not law-abiding, responsible citizens. 

And as I was just suggesting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just 

to be clear, your argument today is that it 

doesn't apply to people who present a threat of 

dangerousness?  Whether you want to characterize

 something that's anticipatory or predictive, 

where a court is -- civil court is making the

 determination.  Just from an -- an analytical 

standpoint, would there be a difference between 

a criminal determination and a civil

 determination?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I don't think 

that it would make a difference with respect to 

whether the legislature can create categories of 

people who are considered dangerous or not 

responsible, and that's very much informed by 

history and tradition here. 

It is not the case that the only 

disarmament provisions that have existed over 

time targeting those who are dangerous are 

provisions that focused on those with criminal 

convictions.  That is, of course, an important 

component of the law-abiding standard in 

particular, but we have a number of examples 

from throughout history of those who were 

disarmed even after civil adjudications or a 

civil-like process, and that includes --

 example, mental illness.  This was the category 

that Heller held up as the quintessential 

example of those who aren't responsible, even

 though mental illness in our legal system has 

always been adjudicated through civil

 proceedings.

 That was true, for example, of

 loyalists.  The disarmament provisions on 

loyalists were enforced through those who were 

refusing to take a loyalty oath, and so there 

wasn't any necessity of a criminal conviction. 

So too with those who were intoxicated.  You 

didn't need to show that they had actually been 

criminally convicted in order to disarm them. 

So I think that there is a 

longstanding tradition here of recognizing that 

individuals can be determined through this 

predictive judgment to be dangerous even in the 

absence of a criminal conviction. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Just one last 

question.  This is a judicial determination

far more difficult to defend an executive branch

 or an administrative determination because of a

 separate Second Amendment principle that guards 

against granting executive officials too much 

discretion to decide who and who cannot have

 firearms.

 In the American -- there was some

 history about that in -- in England, of course, 

but in the American legal tradition, these 

principles have been deployed through 

legislative judgments or through express 

judicial findings of dangerousness.  So I don't

officials that discretion.

implemented through a system of executive

 discretion, just as I was discussing with 

Justice Thomas, I think that there could be 

additional principles that come into play that

 would guard against that kind of licensing

 regime.

 Now, to the extent that that kind of

 background system was intended just to implement

 the -- the bases for disarmament that reflect 

legislative judgments and, you know, in other 

words, to check for whether you have a history 

of -- of commitment to a mental institution or a 

criminal record or so forth, then I think those 

objective standards could be deployed as part of 

a background check system, and -- and Bruen 

specifically suggested as much. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  One more question.  In 

response to my question about the provision that 

prohibits the possession of a firearm by someone 

against whom an order prohibiting violence has 

been entered and the provision doesn't on its 

face require a finding of dangerousness, as I 

recall, your answer was that state laws 

generally do require that and anyway, equitable 

principles require that.

Now suppose someone is later

 prosecuted for violating that provision.  Could 

-- would it be a defense for that person to say 

that the state law in question did not require 

such a finding and, in fact, there was no such

 finding in my case? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think that 

that would provide a basis to collaterally 

challenge the entry of the protective order in 

the federal prosecution.  And we don't think 

that this -- that there should be a system of 

as-applied challenges in this context, because I 

think that what we know is that Congress is 

entitled to make categorical judgments, 

predictive judgments of dangerousness based on 

history and tradition even in -- if there are 

really edge cases where that predictive judgment 

wasn't actually necessary to guard against a 

danger there. 

But, if what you're suggesting is that 

there might be a state out there that is 

ordering judges to enter the subparagraph (c)(2) 

prohibition without any basis to think that 

physical force is likely, I think a person would 

have a very strong due process challenge to that

 suggesting.

 The first error we see is that

 Respondent has asserted here and other courts 

have embraced the idea that the only thing that

 matters under Bruen is regulation.  In other 

words, you can't look at all of the other 

sources of history that usually bear on original

 meaning.

 And I don't think that that can be 

squared with this Court's precedents, starting 

with Heller, which consulted a -- a wide variety 

of historical sources, the same kind of evidence 

we've come forward with here about English 

practice, state constitutional precursors, 

treatises, commentary, state judicial decisions. 

All of that is relevant evidence about the scope 

of the Second Amendment right, and I think the 

Court could make clear that it's not a 

regulation-only test. 

Second, I think that looking just at 

regulations themselves, one of the fundamental 

problems with how courts are applying Bruen is 

the level of generality at which they're parsing 

the historical evidence.

 government's examples and picked them apart to 

say: Well, taking them one by one, there's a

 minute -- minute difference between how this 

regulation operated in 1791 or the ensuing

 decades and how Section 922 provisions operate 

today. And I think that comes very close to 

requiring us to have a dead ringer when Bruen 

itself said that's not necessary.

 The way constitutional interpretation 

usually proceeds is to use history and 

regulation to identify principles, the enduring 

principles that define the scope of the Second 

Amendment right.  And so we think that you 

should make clear the courts should come up a 

level of generality and not nit-pick the -- the 

historical analogues that we're offering to that 

degree. 

And, third and finally, I think that 

in many instances, courts are placing 

dispositive weight on the absence of regulation 

in a circumstance where there's no reason to 

think that that was due to constitutional 

concerns.

there is nothing on the other side of the

 interpretive question in this case to suggest

 that anyone thought you couldn't disarm domestic 

abusers or couldn't disarm dangerous people. 

And in that kind of context, I think to suggest 

that the absence of regulation bears 

substantially on the meaning of the Second

 Amendment is to take a wrong turn.

 It's contrary to the situation the 

Court confronted in Bruen, where there was a lot 

of historical evidence to say states can't 

completely prohibit public carry, and against 

that evidence, you might say that the absence of 

regulation is significant. 

But, here, there's nothing on the 

other side of this interpretive question, and I 

think that that just shows that you shouldn't 

hold the absence of a direct regulation against 

us.

the level of generality question.

 Do you -- do you think the level of

 generality -- I -- I take your point you've got 

surety laws, you've got affray laws, you've got

 a lot of historical evidence, maybe not the

 historical twin.

 And -- and you're saying we should 

overlook that in the same way I think you would

 say -- I want to make sure you'd say the 

analysis also applies similarly to the -- to the 

right side of the ledger, the regulation side on 

the right side.  We're not looking for is -- is 

it -- is it a fowler or is it -- is it a musket. 

Is -- is that a fair understanding of 

-- of -- of how you see the law? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  We think that 

it applies in both directions, both in 

understanding the right itself and in 

understanding the limitations that are built 

into that right. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And you --

you had a discussion about the length of time 

that some of these orders last, and you 

emphasized that you're only arguing for a 

temporary dispossession.

And I -- I guess I -- I'm wondering, 

on a facial challenge, do we need to get into

 any of that, right?  Is -- normally, we ask on a 

facial challenge, is there any set of 

circumstances in which the dispossession would

 be lawful?  And there may be an as-applied if

 it's a lifetime ban.  That would come to us and

 that would be a separate question.  Is that how 

you see it too? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I agree that that 

would be a separate question, yes.  I think that 

there is good reason to reject as-applied 

challenges if and when they come --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- before the Court 

because of the categorical judgments that we 

think history and tradition support, but I 

acknowledge that here it's only a facial 

challenge. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And -- and 

along the same lines on the facial challenge 

aspect of it, do we need to resolve (c)(2) and 

the questions that Justice Alito was asking 

given that the -- the -- the defendant, the 

plaintiff before us -- the Respondent, sorry,

(c)(1) and we actually have a finding of a

 credible threat.  The dangerousness argument

 seems most apparent there.  And we don't know 

much about how all states administer (c)(2)

 regimes.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I agree that 

this is a facial challenge, and the Court could 

confine its analysis to (c)(1). I guess I would 

make just two responses to that. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  One is to say that 

I think it's going to be difficult for the Court

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Of course. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We ourselves have a

invalidated an application of the statute in a 

(c)(2) context. So, unless you want to see me 

here again next term on this issue, I would say 

that --

been fully briefed, and we think it's an

 important part of the statute.

 But the second thing I would say is 

that even if you wanted to confine your analysis

 to (c)(1), I do think that at the very least,

 you would have to reject some of the key 

premises of Respondent's arguments in this case, 

and that relates to the colloquy I had with 

Justice Kagan, for example, the level of 

generality --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- at which he's 

parsing the regulations, the fact that we don't 

have a domestic violence example in particular, 

his arguments that legislatures just can't 

disarm anybody, that persons can't be disarmed, 

that kind of thing. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: I follow all of 

that. Got you. And the same thing goes with 

due process.  We don't have a due process 

challenge before us, and so we don't need to 

resolve any of that either. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.  He 

did not make a due process claim here. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And then,

 duress defense in -- to 922 charges.  You know, 

someone's invaded their home and they use it in

 self-defense.

serious offenses, is that correct?

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And the

 second is the government can prohibit possession 

by those who are not responsible, and by that, 

you mean those who are dangerous, is that

 correct?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, those whose 

possession of firearms would present a danger to

 themselves or others, but they don't have to be

 intentionally dangerous, which gets at the 

culpability question. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Good.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  My question is on 

the law-abiding and responsible also. I guess I 

understood our use of that phrase in our prior 

cases to describe the would-be gun -- gun owners 

in those cases.  Like, we're not talking about 

who might be able to be disarmed.  There might 

be other people.  But all of those people were 

law-abiding and responsible, and there was no 

allegation that they weren't. 

But it seems to me that in your brief

we presented it as a test. Do you see a reason

 for us to use that as the test, law-abiding and 

responsible, given some of the ambiguities in

 that phrase?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I wouldn't 

describe it as a test. I guess what I would do 

is describe it as the relevant category, the 

shorthand to get at the idea that legislatures, 

consistent with the Second Amendment, can take 

action to disarm particular types of people 

whose possession of weapons present these types 

of concerns, either that they have committed 

serious crimes or present a danger. 

And I would use this as shorthand in 

the same way the Court has referred to the 

sensitive places principle or the dangerous and 

unusual weapons principle. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So could I just say 

it's dangerousness?  Let's say that I agree with 

you that when you look back at surety laws and 

the affray laws, et cetera, that it shows that 

the legislature can make judgments to disarm 

people consistently with the Second Amendment 

based on dangerousness. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We certainly --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why can't I just say

 that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We certainly agree

 that that's what history and tradition show.  We 

think that defines the scope of the category of

 those who are not responsible.  We don't think

 dangerousness is the standard with law-abiding,

 and I recognize you might have some different

 views on that, Justice Barrett.  You don't need 

to resolve that issue here.  This is a -- this 

is a case just about someone who is not 

responsible in the form of being dangerous. 

So, yes, we would be happy with a 

decision that says legislatures for time 

immemorial throughout American history have been 

able to disarm those who are dangerous. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But you're trying to 

save, like, the range issue.  So you're not 

applying dangerousness to the crimes? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.  We 

think that there are additional arguments that 

can be made to defend felon disarmament and that 

those depend on the unique history and tradition 

with respect to criminal conduct.  And so we 

would hope to have the opportunity to present

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. And just to 

clarify in response to what you just said to 

Justice Barrett, the determination of 

dangerousness would be evaluated based on what 

modern legislatures think counts as dangerous? 

We're not bound to what qualified as dangerous 

back in the day? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.  We 

think that once the Court recognizes the 

principle that history and tradition support 

this durable principle that you can disarm 

dangerous people, then the question becomes for 

any follow-on challenge whether the legislature 

with respect to a particular category has 

appropriately deemed these individuals dangerous 

and, therefore, fitting within that historical 

tradition.

And I think the inquiry there would 

not be confined to how the Founders thought

 about dangerousness.  Instead, it would turn on 

some of the factors that I was discussing 

earlier with Justice Barrett about the breadth

 of the law, the evidence that supports the

 legislative judgment --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  The kinds of things

 we used --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- and the 

consensus. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: The kinds of things 

we used to look at with the tiers of scrutiny, 

what's the justification for this?  Is that what 

you're saying? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, I don't think 

that this is just a revival of some form of 

means-ends scrutiny because we wouldn't be 

asking the -- a court to balance the intrusion 

on the individual interest against the weight of 

the government's interest.  Instead, this is 

about whether the legislature has properly 

classified a law as falling within the principle 

in the first place. 

And so it's not about balancing

between those two different interests but,

 rather, about looking at the legislature's 

predictive judgment of dangerousness and 

determining ultimately whether it's justified.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So let

 me just ask you about your first methodology --

 methodological error that you identified in 

response to Justice Kagan. You say that the 

courts are focusing too much just on regulation, 

legislation, and not on other indicia of what 

the historical tradition is. 

But, when you were talking with 

Justice Thomas at the beginning, you seemed to 

suggest that the tradition with respect to 

slaves and Native Americans would not be subject 

to consideration for this.  In other words, only 

the regulation as it relates to certain segments 

of society, I guess, count underneath this 

historic traditions test? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, the reason we 

haven't invoked those other laws is because we 

think they were applications of a separate 

principle under the Second Amendment, which is 

that those who are not considered among the 

people can be disarmed.  That, of course, has

 defined that as those who are not part of the

 political community.  And when we looked at how

 those laws operated, they traditionally stripped 

the affected individuals from all rights to 

participate in the political community --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I understand that --

the history and tradition of all of the people

think that those laws are a part of history.  We 

don't think that they're a part of history that 

are directly relevant to the separate question 

at issue here.  And so we've instead pointed to

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And, 

finally, let me just ask you prospectively from 

the standpoint of a legislator today -- I mean,

 we've been talking about sort of the

 retrospective view of this, you know, when 

there's an existing gun control measure that's 

being challenged, how do we determine by looking

 at history whether or not it's constitutional. 

But let's say I'm a legislator today 

in Maine, for example, and I'm very concerned 

about what has happened in that community, and 

my people, the constituents, are asking me to do 

something. 

Do you read Bruen as step one being go 

to the archives and try to determine whether or 

not there's some historical analogue for the 

kinds of legislation that I'm considering? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No. I think that 

Bruen requires a close look at history and 

tradition and analogue to the extent they exist 

and are relevant for purposes of articulating 

the principle.

you can disarm those who are not responsible or 

dangerous, however the Court wants to phrase 

it -- then I don't think it's necessary to 

effectively repeat that same historical 

analogical analysis for purposes of determining

 whether a modern-day legislature's disarmament

 provision fits within the category.

 Instead, I think you would look at the

 factors I was articulating earlier in response 

to Justice Barrett's question about the evidence 

before the legislature of dangerousness, the 

consensus view, whether legislatures routinely 

think of this circumstance as being dangerous, 

the breadth of the law, and other factors along 

those lines. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, if the 

principle has not yet been established, what do 

I do as a legislator? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think, if 

there is no relevant principle that a law would 

slot into, like sensitive place regulation or 

dangerous person regulation, then you would 

conduct the Bruen analysis in order to help try

 But it wouldn't just be a hunt for a

 particular, precise historical analogue.  I -- I 

think that that's really a caricature of Bruen, 

and that would make the Second Amendment a true 

outlier because there's no constitutional right

 that's dictated exclusively by whether there

 happened to be a parallel law on the books in

 1791.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MATTHEW WRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

My friend has -- described several 

times the government's principle that in this 

case, they are not relying on any analogues that 

were directed at people who were not part of the 

people, outside the community, the national or 

political community entirely. 

That means loyalist laws are entirely 

off the analogical spectrum here because

loyalists were also pervasively deprived of all 

of the rights of the people and citizenship.

 They were enemies.  The government said so in

 its Bruen amicus brief.

 In response to Justice Gorsuch's 

question about how the courts of appeals handle

 the issue of self-defense, necessity, duress, we 

cite a case on page 11 of our brief, United 

States versus Penn, I remember that case very 

well, it will show you how they handle it. 

There's effectively not one.  I mean, even brief 

fleeting possession that lasts a little bit 

longer while being chased by people, not enough. 

So there is no real keeping for self-defense 

exception to this principle. 

And in regards to I think it was 

Justice Alito's question of duration of 

protective orders, by default, they can be 

permanent in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, 

Washington.  No specific limit in Florida, 

Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont. Ten years in 

Arkansas, five years in California, Ohio, South 

Dakota.  And in Texas, where the default is two 

years, if the judge finds or a finding is made 

that felony violence was committed, it can be

five years and the time is tolled, for instance,

 when someone's in jail.  And so, while it may be 

the case that if we counted noses, exactly 51 or 

52 are around a year or so, it is not the case

 that they are short. 

Now the danger with any kind of 

historical inquiry is like the person looking 

down a well. So it feels like what the 

government is doing is looking down the dark 

well of American history and seeing only a 

reflection of itself in the 20th and 21st 

century and saying that's what history shows. 

When Congress enacted Section 

922(g)(8) in 1994, it acted without the benefit 

of Heller, McDonald, and Bruen, so we shouldn't 

be surprised that they missed the mark. They 

made a one-sided proceeding that is short a 

complete proxy for a total denial of a 

fundamental and individual constitutional right. 

At this time, I would welcome 

questions from the Court. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Counsel, would you 

take a few -- a bit of your time to recount 

exactly what happened below in this case, not in 

the district court but in state court?

MR. WRIGHT: So what happened in state

 court we know very little about for certain.  We

 have the order, which was attached as an exhibit 

to the federal complaint, and the order reflects

 certain findings.

 We have shown that those findings are 

incredibly common in this one county in Texas, 

but if you did an electronic search of appellate 

cases in Texas with the words "credible threat" 

and "physical safety," I think you would only 

fine three unpublished appellate cases all from 

this county. 

So there are words in it, but it 

wasn't a disputed type of finding.  It was an 

agreed order.  So my client, who was 

unrepresented, and a -- a district attorney, a 

Tarrant County assistant district attorney, 

entered into a stipulation.  This order was 

entered.  The language was in the order.  It's 

in the joint appendix.  You can read it.  And --

and that's it. 

Now I believe that, Justice Thomas, 

more happened.  You could -- we could figure out 

what happened if we pulled out the records, but 

those aren't relevant.  What happens in the

 922(g)(8).

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I think what's 

-- what does matter is we're assuming

 dangerousness or irresponsibility.  Take your

 pick. And we are -- we have a very thin record, 

and I'm trying to get a sense of what actually 

happened in this case.

 MR. WRIGHT: So there are allegations 

that were taken in the federal pre-sentence 

report, and -- and those are the ones that made 

their way into the opinion below. 

And if I could then distinguish 

between the facts that the court found for 

purposes of fixing a sentence in this case and 

the facts that could be contested at a jury, the 

facts that are the subject of the guilty plea, 

the ones that are essential to the conviction, 

in terms of the former category, there was a 

finding that there was, you know, a physical 

assault, that someone had attempted to intervene 

and that Mr. Rahimi had fired a gun into the air 

at that time.  Those -- and -- and -- and there 

are pending charges right now in Tarrant County 

for three misdemeanor offenses that are the same

address those in this case, do we? 

MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I think you 

do have to address them because the existence of 

such a defense is part of the crime, you know,

 MR. WRIGHT: That -- that plays into 

the facial analysis of the statute. And I think 

one of the areas we diverge with my friend is 

this facial versus as-applied distinction, which 

even this Court I was happy to read finds that

 distinction amorphous sometimes. I certainly

 do.

 But, in this case, by -- by a facial 

challenge, we mean the elements specifically 

target conduct that is explicitly protected by 

the plain text of the Second Amendment. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And if -- if --

though, there -- there would be an as-applied 

challenge available later in those cases, right?

that -- that's correct, Justice Gorsuch. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And the same thing

understand your concern about permanent 

dispossession, but, again, that isn't what's

all of its applications, right?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, that -- that 

test for faciality, I -- I think, is primarily

 remedial.  It typically comes up in the civil 

context where someone is suing to enjoin the 

enforcement of a statute and -- and so the 

Salerno test it's called, you know, comes into 

play as to, typically, that assumes there is a 

valid application or a space of valid 

application of the statute, and then the 

complaint is either there's too much outside or 

my case is outside or something like that. 

Ours is a facial challenge in the way 

that Lopez was a facial challenge, where the 

facts of Lopez were clearly within Congress's 

power under the Commerce Clause. This Court 

found the facts of that case were Person A was 

going to pay Lopez $40 to give that gun to 

Person C after school. 

That's within the commerce power, but 

the statute itself was not within Congress's 

power to enact.  And so that statute failed as

to go back to your conversation with Justice 

Thomas, and I guess this touches on what you 

just said to Justice Gorsuch about the thinness 

of the proceeding in state court.

 She did submit a sworn affidavit 

giving quite a lot of detail about the various 

threats, right? So it's not like he just showed 

up and the judge said credible finding of

 violence? 

MR. WRIGHT: So, Justice Barrett, I 

know that to be true.  And I've personally 

looked at it. That's correct.  And it's a 

matter of public record that you can see that. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I -- I've got it. 

MR. WRIGHT: Right.  So -- so -- and I 

don't mean to suggest that.  I mean that in 

terms of what was necessary for the federal 

prosecution, so what we could have defended this 

case on if it went to the jury, the federal 

jury, I mean, for the criminal prosecution, what 

happened before, whether it was good or bad, 

doesn't matter under the statute. 

And we take that as a given from this 

Court's decision in Lewis, where there's sort of 

a -- a conceded constitutional problem with the

 underlying felony prosecution.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, you -- you 

haven't raised a due process challenge to the

 underlying felony prosecution either, right?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, and,

 again --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It's a Second

 Amendment challenge strictly speaking.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's correct, Your 

Honor. And we take that from Lewis.  Lewis says 

what Congress intended when it passed the Gun 

Control Act in 1968 was those matters are off 

the table. 

So, in Lewis, there's no doubt there 

is a constitutional violation and a violation of 

due process under this Court's holding. 

However, there is no Fifth Amendment claim 

against a felon in possession prosecution, even 

if the underlying felony is concededly unlawful 

and unconstitutional. 

So we take that as a given when we 

come to a statute like this, that even if we 

could show a due process issue with respect to 

the issuance of the protective order, that would 

be no defense against the federal prosecution.

But, if I'm wrong about that, I'm

 happy to hear it.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It would have been

 in the state prosecution, though?

 MR. WRIGHT:  I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It would have been 

in the state prosecution potentially, in the

 state protective order proceeding, and you could 

have had a due process argument and raised it 

there. 

MR. WRIGHT: You're right, Justice 

Gorsuch, and that gets to a really important 

point here.  Because Congress has made this sort 

of a per se automatic disarmament and it has 

tied it to the issuance of a protective order, 

there is no due process required before a court 

enters an order enjoining me from committing 

physical abuse against someone else.  That is 

not a protected right. 

So what we have is a proceeding that's 

designed to adjudicate small rights or no rights 

at all.  And then, based on the results of that 

proceeding and even the findings that are 

entered in that proceeding, we take very 

consequential actions that go against an

not aware of any due process that would apply 

with respect to the part of the order that

Amendment, and has --

entered, there's no due process rights that an

order that forbids further abuse.

 MR. WRIGHT: To the extent that the 

only remedy granted by that order is forbidding 

abuse, forbidding physical abuse, I don't think 

that you have any right to due process before 

that is entered because you have no right to

 abuse anyone.  It's -- it's just not.  The

 incentives --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You have no right to 

murder someone, but we give you a trial. 

MR. WRIGHT:  Right.  So --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right?  And so 

there's always process before a right or life, 

liberty, or property is taken from you of some 

kind. What measure of due process depends upon 

facts, circumstances -- I -- I'm not -- I'm not 

talking about that.  But I -- I'm -- I'm 

surprised to hear you say that the Fifth and the 

Fourteenth Amendments' Due Process Clauses don't 

apply to an individual who is being subject to a 

protective order. 

MR. WRIGHT: I think depending on what 

the protective order required. So those --

those probably do kick in in the same way that 

if this were a -- a true disarmament proceeding.

So this Court I don't think has announced the 

criteria that would be required in something 

like a red flag law, but something like that.

 So it's -- everyone's attention is focused on 

the loss of firearm rights.

 There would be certain requirements.

 And -- and we could argue about it.  I would

 submit it would probably need to be clear and 

convincing evidence, but it would certainly need 

to be fundamentally fair because this is a 

fundamental right. 

That's not what any state does for a 

civil protective order.  There's typically no 

incentive and often no real opportunity to 

contest the issuance of the order. And in many 

cases, people are happy to consent to the orders 

because they don't want to be around the person 

anymore either. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But, counsel, I just 

want to clarify, you're right you don't have, 

you know, the right to commit violence against 

anyone, but this protective order says a whole 

lot more than that.  I mean, he's prohibited 

from communicating with his family, with going 

within 200 yards of her residence. So I think

that paints a little bit of a different picture 

in the due process rights that might apply.

 MR. WRIGHT: I agree, Your Honor, that 

the Due Process Clause would impose limits 

against involuntary termination of access to

 one's children, for -- for instance.  So I don't

 mean to suggest -- and -- and, Justice Gorsuch,

 if that's what I implied, I didn't mean to. I

 don't mean to suggest that the Due Process 

Clause doesn't -- it doesn't matter what happens 

in one of these proceedings. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, counsel --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Wright, may -- may 

I ask just about your basic argument here?  And 

I'm just going to read you a sentence from the 

brief, and I want to know whether, you know, 

that's your essential argument. 

It says, "...the Government has yet to 

find even a single American jurisdiction that 

adopted a similar ban while the founding 

generation walked the earth." 

So is that what we should be looking 

for? And if we don't find that similar ban, we 

say that the government has no right to do 

anything?

MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I think

 that's largely what Bruen says.  However, I

 don't think it has to be so narrow.  So, if the 

government could affirmatively prove from the 

historical tradition of either American firearms 

laws or even I would be willing to spot them the 

way that we have treated other fundamental 

constitutionally protected rights, if they could 

tie it to one of those historical traditions, 

that would be good enough under the logic of 

Bruen, if not the exact rule --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not quite 

sure what the answer means.  I mean, I took that 

sentence to be saying we're looking for a 

regulation that even if it's not every jot and 

tittle is essentially targeting the same kind of 

conduct as the regulation under review. 

And, you know, the -- the Solicitor 

General told us that was the wrong approach, 

that what Bruen really directs courts to do is 

to think about the various principles that were 

operating at that time, whether those principles 

gave rise to a particular regulation that was

 MR. WRIGHT: I think both

 methodological positions lead to the same 

result, which is affirmance of the decision

 below. It's not just something that is about 

domestic violence or a ban that's punishable by

 exactly 10 years.  In other words, that's the 

way that some of the amici have described what 

we're arguing for. 

I'm saying there's no ban, there's no 

history of bans for people who were part of the 

national community.  They don't exist.  I'm 

saying that the plain text of the Second 

Amendment, the way that it distinguished from 

the English common-law tradition, I'm saying 

that the early commentators like St. George 

Tucker and William Rawle, they all said, if 

you're just keeping the firearm --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- but that does 

suggest, I mean, that you're looking for a ban 

on domestic violence.  And, you know, 200 some 

years ago, the problem of domestic violence was 

conceived very differently.  People had a 

different understanding of the harm.  People had

a different understanding of the right of

 government to try to prevent the harm.  People 

had different understandings with respect to 

pretty much every aspect of the problem.

 So, if you're looking for a ban on 

domestic violence, it's not going to be there.

 MR. WRIGHT: Justice Kagan, I'm

 looking for a ban.  I'm looking for a ban, some 

criminal punishment for just the keeping of a 

firearm.  That's what I'm looking for. And it's 

based not on the loss of status of citizenship, 

you know, or being outside the community.  I'm 

looking for a ban that applies to a 

rights-holding American citizen. I mean, that's 

-- I'd start with that. 

Short of that, again -- and I suspect 

the response to that is this Court has 

tentatively approved felon in possession.  But 

felons are so different.  They have all kinds of 

process.  There's a long tradition of denying 

people convicted of infamous crimes all manner 

of rights of citizenship or not. 

So, if I could just set that aside, 

there's no ban because, at the time, when the 

people of the time actually wrote about it, they

wrote that there's no right to misuse a firearm. 

So the allegations that have been made against 

my client, we do not contend that behavior is

 protected by the Second Amendment.

 The behavior that's protected is the

 keeping of arms.  The behavior that is also

 protected is the carrying of arms, but I would

 concede -- I would concede there is a strong 

historical tradition of providing more 

restrictions against the right to public carry 

because that's where you encounter other people. 

This is someone who's keeping a 

firearm in his own home.  The oldest American 

tradition at least of a federal government, 

someone who everyone agreed was subject to the 

Second Amendment, passing that kind of law, was 

1968. This tie is older than that so-called 

tradition, Your Honor.  It -- it just -- it's 

20th century, late 20th century. And so we 

disagree at a very fundamental level of whether 

there is this tradition. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So you -- your 

argument is that except for someone who has been 

convicted of a felony, a person may not be 

prohibited from possessing a firearm in the

home, is that correct?

 MR. WRIGHT: I would add one more

 caveat to it, Justice Alito, and that is if 

severe criminal punishment will result, because 

that is something that Heller itself and Bruen

 itself took into this balance, because what --

the right that's protected is the right of 

someone who, by keeping the firearm, you know,

 is used -- for lawful -- someone who's keeping a 

firearm for lawful purposes, how does this 

regulation infringe on that?  If it is a small 

fine or even loss of the weapon, maybe that 

doesn't violate that right.  You could make it 

illegal, you're prohibited from keeping a 

weapon, but if we figured out that you had a 

weapon in your bedroom, you -- you -- you may 

have to pay for it, you know, but you're not 

going to go to prison for 10 or 15 years. 

You're not going to get felony liability. 

I think all of those things together 

are incredibly important about this ban because 

they are -- it is not based on loss of rights of 

citizenship.  It is applied against 

rights-holders.  It is a total ban.  And it is 

punishable by an incredible amount of prison

this example. Suppose a state judge determines 

after a hearing that a man has repeatedly 

threatened to shoot the members of his family, 

has brandished the gun, has terrified them, and 

orders the man not -- enters a restraining order 

preventing that man from possessing a firearm 

any place, including in the home. 

Is that constitutional? 

MR. WRIGHT: I think the answer is 

probably yes if he -- I think it probably is.  I 

would want to know more about what the 

historical tradition showed, but, certainly, 

courts have always had broad power against the 

people who are brought before them.  And --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So --

MR. WRIGHT: -- I think that would be 

consistent with the historical --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So the difference you 

see between that order and the prosecution for

latter imposes a -- a felony punishment?

 Another difference is that the

 defendant had a real opportunity, you know, in

 standing before the court to say either, number

 one, I didn't do that or, number two, something

 was wrong with me, I'll never do that again.

 But -- and I'll move across the country so I can

 assure you that they will be safe, but I'm very

 frightened to be, you know, without my arms.  So 

you would have a chance to entreat with the 

person who's putting in the restriction. 

If the restriction itself was 

unlawful, the person would have a chance to 

appeal it to a higher authority, to an appellate 

court, and say this judge got it wrong, you 

know, this is not lawful either under the 

Constitution or under this state's substantive 

law. 

All of those things are different in 

the situation that you describe, and I think 

they are constitutionally significant 

differences between that and what we have here.

away from them and you don't have to institute 

proceedings immediately.  However, you do have 

to institute them pretty quick after that.

because I thought your argument was that there 

was no history or tradition, as Justice Kagan

 just said, of this kind -- of -- of disarmament 

in this circumstance. But now it kind of sounds 

like your objection is just to the process.

 Like, are you making Judge Ho's

 argument only? 

MR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor, I'm not 

making Judge Ho's argument only. The -- the law 

that's before us right now is a ban.  It's a ban 

that's passed by a legislature.  And it -- it is 

-- you -- you can't get around it.  You -- you 

can't even ask the state court to say, you know, 

I'll accept a protection order, a stay-away 

order, just give me permission to keep firearms 

for my own self-defense. That will not prevent 

this ban from kicking in.  And it has severe 

penalties that result from it, and it applies 

everywhere, even in the home. 

I think all of those things together 

make this statute unconstitutional.  I 

understood the question to be, what about 

something else?  Would that be constitutional? 

And I think so, but we would need to know --

we'd need to do a full workup on the history and

 Court can answer in this case because there's no

 such law before the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but

 MR. WRIGHT: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I

 understand your answer to say that there will be 

circumstances where someone could be shown to be 

sufficiently dangerous that the firearm can be 

taken from him. 

MR. WRIGHT: Yes.

that the end of the case? 

MR. WRIGHT: Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All you need 

to do is show that there are circumstances in

MR. WRIGHT: Because this statute is

their firearms when there's an imminent threat

 of lawful violence on the way to do it.

 And I think, again, it's consistent 

with the Court's traditional equitable powers 

that if nothing short of surrender would protect 

life and limb, the court's going to be able to 

order surrender in the same way that if the

 police see that someone has, you know, suicidal, 

they have reason to believe they're suicidal, of 

course, the police can go and take the firearm 

away from them.  They can't keep it forever, and 

they can't put somebody in prison for 10 years 

because he had the firearm there. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I hear you 

isolating bans by the legislature as opposed to 

circumstances in which a court might have 

particular facts in this way. 

Is that what you're doing?  You're 

sort of saying, bans by the legislature are a 

different thing than we have facts of imminent 

potential danger and someone runs to the court. 

There might be a history and tradition of that, 

but you see that as different than a ban by the 

legislature such as what is happening here?

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So I

 guess I'm just trying to understand, maybe this

 is an aside, but your brief does indicate that 

you are aware of historical bans, laws banning

 firearm possession by disfavored categories of

 people.

 And -- and the government talks about 

this as well. And so do you agree with the

 government that those kinds of bans we don't 

look at or care about when we're trying to 

figure out whether or not there's history and 

tradition here? 

MR. WRIGHT: Yes.  And I don't want to 

speak for my friend.  I understood the 

government's position to be we don't look at 

those laws in this case.  It sounds like they 

may still be on the table for some other person 

who's outside the political community. 

I say you don't look at them at all 

because, number one, they're awful, they're 

terrible laws.  We should not give credence to a 

suggestion that a -- a legislator in 1870 in the 

south -- you know, we should -- so we should not

 history and traditions test.  I -- I guess I --

I'm a little troubled by having a history and 

traditions test that also requires some sort of

 culling of the history so that only certain

 people's history counts.

 So what do we do with that?  Isn't 

that a flaw with respect to the test?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I think what 

you do is the Bruen test starts with the text. 

And so, ultimately, historical tradition as I 

understand it is something the Court does to 

make sure its textual interpretation is correct 

and consistent with the original understanding 

of the amendment. 

So, in the situation that you're 

describing, those laws, they were not people who 

were part of the community.  They never -- they 

weren't seen as the people.  And when these laws 

were challenged, including in this very Court, 

that was the reason.  Well -- well, this Court 

was not dealing with a disarmament law but other 

laws that were -- targeted those groups. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So does that mean 

only Reconstruction Era as opposed to -- sorry, 

only Foundational Era as opposed to

 here?

 MR. WRIGHT: For purposes of the

 Second Amendment, as -- and applied against the

 Founding Era sources and immediately after the 

Founding Era, so people who understood they were

 bound by that.

 Like, again, I don't see these two 

steps of Bruen as completely separate pieces. 

You know, you pass the text point and you move 

on. The Court is trying to get at the meaning 

of the text, the original public meaning of the 

text.

with respect to domestic violence, are we 

looking for history and tradition in the 

Reconstruction Era about how regulation was 

happening in the circumstance of domestic 

violence or no?

I think this is going back to a question that

 Justice Kagan asked -- that what we're looking

 for is Reconstruction Era sources, I suppose, 

that applied to the regulation of white 

Protestant men related to domestic violence.

 Is that sort of the level that we are

 focused on when we're trying to find a history

 and tradition? 

MR. WRIGHT: No, Your Honor.  And --

and -- and I may not have been clear before. I 

think it's the Founding Era and not the 

Reconstruction Era when we're talking about the

Or are we looking for a regulation concerning 

this set of circumstances?

 MR. WRIGHT: It doesn't have to be 

specific to domestic violence. I'm not saying

 that.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MR. WRIGHT: Violence, interpersonal

 violence, dueling, any -- robbery.  The -- so, 

in other words, society understood violence, 

understood dangerous people.  Danger existed. 

But they rejected at every point the type of 

dangerousness disarmament principle that the 

government is advocating. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that the 

Congress can disarm people who are mentally ill, 

who have been committed to mental institutions? 

MR. WRIGHT: Setting aside an 

enumerated powers problem, so they're in the 

District of Columbia or something like that, 

there's definitely a tradition for restricting 

sale or provision of weapons to the mentally ill

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'll tell you the

 honest truth, Mr. Wright.  I feel like you're

 running away from your argument, you know, 

because the implications of your argument are 

just so untenable that you have to say no, 

that's not really my argument.

 I mean, it just seems to me that your 

argument applies to a wide variety of disarming 

actions, bans, what have you, that -- that we 

take for granted now because it's -- it's so 

obvious that people who have guns pose a great 

danger to others and you don't give guns to 

people who have the kind of history of domestic 

violence that your client has or to the mentally 

ill or what have you. 

So I -- I guess -- you know, I guess 

I'm asking you to clarify your argument because 

you seem to be running away from it because you 

can't stand what the consequences of it are. 

MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I am running 

away from interest balancing because I 

understand that that same sort of argument could 

have been made in Bruen, could have been made in

Heller, could have been made in McDonald, and, 

in fact, were made in all of those cases, right?

 Legislatures have made a judgment that 

it is dangerous to have people carrying weapons

 about. Legislatures made a judgment it's

 dangerous for handguns specifically to be

 possessed.  And the Court didn't defer to those

 late or mid-20th century judgments or even early 

20th century judgments about dangerousness in 

that scenario. 

Instead, the Court said we are going 

to follow our understanding of the original 

public meaning of the text and -- as illuminated 

by the historical tradition of firearms 

regulation at the margins.  So I -- I guess 

that's what I want to say, is that if there's no 

such tradition -- so if you couldn't -- I -- I'm 

supposing that we would find examples of people 

having firearms removed from them if they are an 

imminent danger to others. 

That historical record has not been 

built in this case because that's not the kind 

of law that we have. I do believe that it's 

there, and I could give some additional examples 

where I think we could find support for that.

 And just to be clear, are you --

you're not challenging the state court aspect of

 this?

 MR. WRIGHT: That's -- that's correct,

 Your Honor.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But solely -- and 

your language was it was a per se violation or 

automatic violation of 922, and that is your 

problem? 

MR. WRIGHT: The -- the possession of 

firearms.  It's the bootstrapping of what is a 

proceeding that is one-sided and does not have 

any kind of historical connection to the loss of 

citizenship rights, bootstrapping that as like a 

conclusive presumption to a right that the 

federal Constitution guarantees against 

Congress. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So there was some 

talk about possibly challenging this under the 

Due Process Clause later on or a as-applied 

challenge to this.  How would -- how would you 

see that taking place if this is an automatic 

disarmament?

MR. WRIGHT: I -- I will be interested 

to read how it would proceed. My understanding 

is that you can't raise it in a 922(g)

 prosecution.  I base that on Lewis and on what 

we understand Congress's intent to be in 

enacting these categorical bans.

 In the state court itself, when it's 

been raised in state courts, they typically 

point to the federal statute and say, well, 

Congress -- you know, Congress, you know, said 

it's okay, so -- so, you know, if you have this 

kind of order, then you lose. So I think 

922(g)(8) plays a role in that sense. 

And if the issue is that you have tied 

a larger constitutional right to sort of a 

smaller right, it's not clear what -- what 

imposes that due process requirement on the 

state court.  And so I think that this was an 

agreed order because he doesn't have counsel, he 

doesn't have the ability to do it, and -- and --

and he's ultimately willing, I guess, to -- to 

-- to submit, maybe to avoid the attorneys' 

fees, which is a way that they apparently get 

people to agree to these orders. 

That would not be a fundamentally fair

 Justice Gorsuch?

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One specific thing 

in the government's reply brief that I want to 

get your response to. At page 21 of the reply 

brief, the government notes the background check 

system that Congress has created to prevent the 

sale of firearms to prohibited persons. 

Domestic violence protective orders are promptly 

incorporated into that system.  It's resulted in 

more than 75,000 denials, the government says, 

based on these protective orders in the last 25 

years. 

According to the government, under 

your argument, that system could no longer stop 

persons subject to those domestic violence 

protective orders from buying firearms.  Just 

want to get your response to that.

of all, the same system incorporates state 

prohibitions against firearm possession, and so, 

if there is a lawful provision imposed by state

 law or by a judge in a court, it could be

 incorporated into the background check system.

 Second, I would have to concede that 

there is a historical tradition of limiting who

 citizens, people within the community, could 

provide weapons to outside the community, if you 

will. And so it could be that that historical 

tradition would support a restriction on 

commercial sale of arms.  That's an example that 

-- LRJ was one that's -- maybe has a different 

framework.  So that would -- that's an argument 

that could be made in favor of that sort of 

provision or sort of background check process 

that would not go away with 922(g)(8). 

And just as a highly technical matter, 

I understand that to be a function of 922(d)(8), 

which, again, is restricting what the licensed 

firearms dealer can do, not (g)(8), which is the 

restriction on possession by the citizen.  This 

is what my client went to prison for. 

And so I -- but, on the other hand, if 

you have a right to possess a firearm, then,

certainly, the acquisition of a firearm is

 closely connected to that and constitutional 

implications would come into play. So I just 

don't have a firm view on whether or not a law 

that operated more like some of the earliest 

20th century laws that sort of dealt with 

acquisition of firearms, that might survive

 constitutional scrutiny.

MR. WRIGHT: It's possible?  No, I

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Is that what you 

just said? 

MR. WRIGHT: No, I don't think it's 

possible.  It is possible that it would be 

unconstitutional to deny people the right to 

purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer, yes, 

I think that is possible. 

But I suspect that both existing law 

and constitutional laws would allow many of 

those same people to be denied if we worked our

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So the restraining

 order prevented your client from possessing a

 firearm, and it also immediately suspended his

 handgun license.  Was that unconstitutional?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, just to take

 issue with the second part of the question

 first, that language, suspending handgun 

license, that's in all of these Tarrant County 

orders.  That's part of the boilerplate --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But, still, it says 

it's ordered that his handgun license is 

immediately suspended. 

MR. WRIGHT: Right. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So just let's --

let's go with the -- with the order's language. 

Did that violate the Second Amendment, putting 

922 aside? 

MR. WRIGHT: I think, to answer that 

question, then we -- we would bring the whole 

record, the record that was before the court and 

terms, and -- and the client agreed to the 

order. So it would be very difficult to --

 MR. WRIGHT: Right.

 JUSTICE BARRETT: You know, she had

 the affidavit.  Let's -- let's imagine they --

they go back and forth.  Let's -- let's imagine

 Would it be unconstitutional then to 

deprive your client of his handgun license and 

his -- his -- prohibit him from possessing a 

firearm?  Because I assume that -- you've said

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess I'm just

 trying to get a clear answer to whether or not

 we're looking for historical analogues related 

to domestic violence or something broader.

 You -- you -- you suggested -- and 

your brief I'm now revisiting suggests that the 

government cites no laws punishing members of 

the American political community for possessing 

firearms in their own homes based on 

dangerousness, irresponsibility, crime 

prevention, violent history, or any other 

character trait. 

So you just say there are no bans that 

relate to any of those things. 

MR. WRIGHT: That's my understanding 

of the historical record that we have in this 

case, yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And if the 

government were to convince us that there was a 

ban related to, say, dangerousness, do you lose?

 domestic violence.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's not my point, Your

 Honor.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MR. WRIGHT: That's -- that's --

that's not something that we're -- people could

 argue that, but I don't think anybody -- none of

 our amici have argued that.  Certainly, there's 

some point at which someone could be separated 

from a firearm. 

This law doesn't do that at all for 

anyone.  This is just: Can you be punished for 

keeping a firearm?  And I think that the -- the 

text of the Constitution says no, the early 

commentators would say no at least as far as 

Congress doing it, and the historical tradition 

all say no. 

So, in terms the level of abstraction, 

I don't see how this case presents that because 

there's just nothing, no bans.  No bans against 

rights-holders.

Rebuttal, General?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Thank you, Mr.

 Chief Justice.

 My friend began his argument this 

morning in response to a question from Justice 

Kagan saying that he does read Bruen to require 

the government to come forward with a precise 

historical analogue in order to justify a 

modern-day firearms regulation. 

I think that is a clearly incorrect 

reading of Bruen.  Unfortunately, it's a 

profound misreading that many lower courts have 

been adopting.  And I think that it's important 

for the Court to understand the destabilizing 

consequences of that reading in the lower 

courts. 

Just last week, a court invalidated 

Section 922(g)(1), the felon prohibition 

statute, on its face as applied to the most 

violent and horrific crimes imaginable on the 

theory that the government didn't have a 

sufficiently precise historical analogue to 

justify a permanent ban on felons.

Many courts now, several district

 courts, have credited as-applied challenges to 

Section 922(g)(1) by armed career criminals who

 have multiple convictions for aggravated

 assault, drug trafficking, armed robbery, 

clearly violent crimes, because we don't have a

 sufficient historical analogue disarming those 

subject to precisely those crimes at the 

Founding. And a court has also invalidated on 

its face the provision of federal law that 

prohibits possession of firearms with 

obliterated serial numbers, again, on the theory 

that we don't have a Founding Era analogue that 

is sufficiently precise that says you have to 

serialize firearms possession. 

I think that those are clearly 

untenable results.  They are profoundly 

destabilizing, and Bruen doesn't require them. 

Once the Court corrects the 

misinterpretation of Bruen, then I think the 

constitutional principle is clear.  You can 

disarm dangerous persons. And under that 

principle, Section 922(g)(8) is an easy case. 

It's an easy case for three reasons. 

First, it requires an individualized

 finding of dangerousness.  Now I think I heard 

my friend to concede today that those kinds of 

individualized findings of dangerousness do 

suffice for disarmament, and he questions 

whether the process in state court judicial

 proceedings is sufficient.

 But that ultimately is a procedural

 claim that should be adjudicated under the Due

 Process Clause, and I think that it ignores two 

fundamental features that are relevant here. 

First, the Section 922(g)(8) guarantees notice 

and a hearing.  It only permits disarmament in 

those situations, so the most fundamental 

protection of due process is validated under 

this provision. 

And, second, that there is a 

presumption of regularity that exists in this 

context.  And to -- to say or suggest that all 

of these state court procedural orders, 

protective orders, are fundamentally flawed or 

inherently unreliable, I think, would override 

that presumption in this case and be profoundly 

unsettling for the state courts that are on the 

front lines here trying to protect victims of 

domestic violence.

I think as well that these principles

 equally demonstrate subparagraph (c)(2)'s 

validity. We think that there is an inherent 

requirement that the Court find that the threat 

of physical force is likely to occur in order to

 justify entering that kind of judicial finding, 

and that provides a basis to uphold Section

 922(g)(8) with respect to all of its

 applications. 

The second reason why this is an easy 

case is because there is a legislative 

consensus.  It is not just Congress, but 48 

states and territories share this view that 

armed domestic violence needs to be guarded 

against and that disarmament is a permissible 

legislative response.  And so I think that 

further fortifies the congressional judgment. 

And the third reason why Section 

922(g)(8) should be an easy case is because it 

does guard against a profound harm.  A woman who 

lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five 

times more likely to be murdered if he has 

access to a gun.

 officers as well.  I was struck by the data

 showing that armed -- that domestic violence 

calls are the most dangerous type of call for a 

police officer to respond to in this country. 

And for those officers who die in the line of 

duty, virtually all of them are murdered with

 handguns.

           Section 922(g)(8) takes account of

 those concerns, and, here, history and tradition 

confirm common sense.  Congress can disarm armed 

domestic abusers in light of those profound 

concerns. 

So we'd ask the Court to correct the 

Fifth Circuit's methodological errors and 

reverse. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:37 a.m., the case 

was submitted.)
