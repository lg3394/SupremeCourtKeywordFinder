 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-1165,

 Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation versus

 Moab.

 Ms. Coberly.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA T. COBERLY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MS. COBERLY: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Like many cases, this case should be 

resolved by the text, and, here, the text is in 

Rule 10b-5 as adopted by the Congress in the 

PSLRA. That text makes clear that an omission 

is actionable in just one circumstance, when the 

omitted fact is material and necessary to make a 

statement not misleading. 

Today, you're going to hear arguments 

for omission liability in a different 

circumstance, when the omitted fact is material 

and required to be stated by Item 303. None of 

those arguments is rooted in the text. 

The text doesn't permit eliding the 

statement requirement by treating the entire

management narrative as misleading if one thing 

is left out. The PSLRA shows that Congress had

 something far more specific in mind by the word

 "statement."

 The text also doesn't permit recasting 

a claim about what a 10-K does or doesn't say as 

a claim involving a fraudulent scheme or act. 

Whenever this Court has recognized liability

 under Rule 10b-5(a) or (c), the case has 

involved something more or different than speech 

alone. 

And this is all in the context of the 

judicially implied private right of action, 

which this Court is loath to expand.  No 

circuit, either before or after the PSLRA, has 

approached 10b-5 liability in the ways that Moab 

and the government are seeking here. 

Now, to be clear, no one is seeking 

immunity.  The SEC has extensive powers to 

penalize an omission that violates Item 303. 

But, without the element of a misleading 

statement, an omission can't be the subject of a 

private class action. 

I'm happy to take the Court's 

questions.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Can a -- a compliance

 certification statement be made misleading by an

 omission?

 MS. COBERLY: I would say no, Your 

Honor, for a couple of reasons.

 So, first of all, the government isn't 

arguing that a compliance statement itself is a

 misleading statement.  The government's argument 

is that a compliance statement makes the 

narrative as a whole the misleading statement. 

As for the compliance certification 

itself, though, Your Honor, that statement 

wouldn't be actionable under the federal 

securities laws because, first of all, it would 

be a statement of opinion, and, secondly, to the 

extent that it is relating to an item of future 

import, it would be protected by the 

forward-looking -- the bar on claims against 

forward-looking statements by the safe harbor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are there any 

specific arguments with respect to 906? I think 

that question was related to 906 and the 

certification there. 

MS. COBERLY: They're -- the -- Moab 

is making an argument based on 906, Your Honor.

I'll note that the Second Circuit did not rely

 on 906, a 906 certification.  The 906 

certification wasn't mentioned in the complaint,

 in the briefs below, or -- or in the brief in

 opposition.  So we don't think it's really --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that sort of 

certification is not a part of the 303 filing,

 is it?

 MS. COBERLY: It is not.  It is a 

separate document from the securities filings 

themselves.  And, of course, the requirement for 

a 906 certification does not appear in the 

securities laws.  It appears in the criminal 

code. And this Court is loath to interpret a 

civil remedy from something in the criminal code 

unless Congress specifically stated so. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, in this case, 

we don't need to reach that issue? 

MS. COBERLY: I think that's correct, 

Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I --

the distinction you draw between sort of 

half-truths and omissions strikes me as one that 

might be hard to apply in practice. 

Let's say you have a statement that,

you know, our -- our sales are going to rise 

because of the new processors we're going to 

bring online, but what you don't say is that our

 sales are going to fall because EPA is going to

 issue new regulations.  You know what --

something like along those lines that you know. 

And they're going to limit further the use of

 No. 6 oil. 

Now is -- is that an omission case 

because, you -- you know, there's a difference 

between new processors increasing sales and EPA 

regulation lowering it, or is it a half-truth 

situation because the first part says our sales 

will rise? 

MS. COBERLY: Well, Your Honor, that's 

a kind of question that district courts answer 

every day in securities cases.  In every 

instance where a plaintiff identifies a 

statement and identifies it as a half-truth, the

the answer in the hypothetical that I --

MS. COBERLY: I think the answer to 

that question, Your Honor, would be no, and 

that's because the statement needs to be

 something like in kind in both subject matter

 and specificity.  And so the classic example

 that this Court has discussed in Escobar is

 taken from Justice Cardozo in Junius 

Construction, and that's two streets intersect 

and if a third also exists but is omitted, then 

the statement about the two streets might be 

misleading by omission. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, where do you get 

that from the text?  I mean, I understand how 

you get your principal argument from the text. 

But, there, I understood you to be saying that 

there are limits on the ways in which an 

omission can make statements in the MD&A or in 

the broader form misleading, and I don't see 

anything like that in the text. 

MS. COBERLY: Well, what the text 

tells us, Your Honor, is -- is the -- the text 

makes it unlawful to omit to state a material 

fact necessary in order to -- to make the 

statements made, in the light of the

 statement rendered misleading and the omitted

 MS. COBERLY: The -- it comes from the

each statement must be specifically identified 

in the complaint. So the PSLRA took that plural

let me explain why. I think, in that instance, 

there might very well be a statement that is the 

-- that satisfies the statement element of the

 omission claim, it -- provided that it was

 identified in the complaint.

 But this is why the specificity is so

 important.  Once that specific statement, that 

-- that paragraph with the rosy future and so 

on, is identified in the complaint, then the 

defendant has the opportunity to move to dismiss 

the case. 

It might, for example, in that 

instance invoke a -- invoke the safe harbor for 

forward-looking statements.  It might also 

invoke this Court's ruling in Omnicare, which 

identifies statements of opinion as being 

different from statements of fact. 

Now, of course, a statement of opinion 

can be misleading, but that requires a very 

special kind of omitted fact that the Court was 

very clear about in the Omnicare decision. 

So the importance of the specific 

statement is tied in part to the PSLRA's 

requirements, which are very important here, 

especially because that's the moment when

Congress finally weighed in on the judicially

 implied private right of action.

 But the statement requirement is also 

important because of all the things that flow 

from it, all of the other elements and 

safeguards that use the statement as their

 predicate.  And to have, as -- as the government 

argues, the statement be the entire narrative, 

which, here, was pages and pages and pages on 

many different topics with respect to multiple 

different subsidiaries of a holding company, 

that kind of statement isn't what the -- the 

Congress had in mind when it used the word 

"statement" in the PSLRA. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Ms. Coberly, can I 

ask you what I think is a -- a variation on this 

theme? Is the rule that you're asking for 

pretty narrow? 

Because the Chief and Justice Kagan 

are pointing out that it can sometimes be 

difficult to tell when an omission causes a 

statement or statements in the disclosure to be 

misleading.  So Professor Grundfest suggests 

that most omission cases can pretty easily be 

repleaded as misleading statement cases.

Do you agree that that's going to be 

true of some significant portion of these, 

meaning that the rule that you're asking for is

 fairly narrow?

 MS. COBERLY: It -- yes, I do agree 

with that, Your Honor. And so, first of all, I 

think it's important to remember how we got

 here. The Second Circuit held that a violation 

of Item 303 is actionable independent of whether 

there's a misleading statement.  And -- and we 

think that rule is incorrect and needs to be 

vacated. 

Now, as far as what the -- the status 

quo will be going forward, and it is what the 

law is in every other circuit right now, a 

plaintiff must identify a specific statement. 

If that happens, then, of course, the statement 

requirement is satisfied and we move on to the 

other elements. 

So all we're seeking here is respect 

for the text of 10(b) that -- which says that an 

omission is actionable only when necessary to --

when the omitted fact is necessary to make the 

other statements made not misleading.  And so 

we're -- we're simply asking for what Congress

Second Circuit?  So did you make these -- this

 argument in the Second Circuit?

 I mean, obviously, we can just, if we 

were to rule in your favor, not to suggest we 

are, but just to say that, we would vacate and 

remand and let the Second Circuit apply the

 correct rule, correct?

 MS. COBERLY: Yes.  But the -- the two 

statements, there were two very specific 

statements that the court found had been 

adequately pleaded as half-truths, and both of 

those statements, first of all, were in oral 

discussions.  They were not in pleadings.  They 

were not in filings with the SEC. So Item 303 

didn't apply to them at all. 

They were statements made orally by 

management in conferences with investors, and 

the court held that both of those statements 

were rendered misleading by -- and this is how 

the -- Moab had argued it -- by the omission of 

specific facts relating to the base of 

customers. 

So they're very -- they're statements

misleading because there was information about

 those customers, factual information, that had 

been omitted. So that's the very narrow

 omission claim, half-truth claim, that the

 Second Circuit allowed to proceed.

 And that claim, by the way, is

 proceeding today in the district court.  The

 claim that's before the Court today is about --

is a much broader claim.  It's a claim that --

that the holding company should have disclosed 

not just the existence of IMO 2020, not the fact 

that it -- the alleged fact that it didn't 

comply with Item 303, but very specifically the 

idea, the prediction, that IMO 2020 would have a 

very significant negative impact on the 

performance of one of the subsidiaries and that 

that impact would cause the holding company to 

cut its dividends, which is ultimately the news 

that the plaintiffs allege led to the decrease 

in the stock price.

you're going to claim that they're wrong about 

the way in which the omission had an impact, but 

I guess they're also arguing that you're seeking 

blanket immunity for omissions in the Item 303

 context.

 Are you?

 MS. COBERLY: We are not, Your Honor.

 And --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you -- so you 

agree that Item 303 omissions could give rise to 

the kind of liability that they say exists here? 

MS. COBERLY: No.  No. And I want to 

draw a distinction between immunity and 10b-5. 

So we think that in -- a failure to comply with 

Item 303 is not actionable unless it's tied to a 

specific misleading statement that's plead --

pleaded in the complaint, in which case the Item 

303 requirement is not doing very much work. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But can that -- can 

that statement be of the nature that the SG 

points out?  So you have a list, you know, the 

company does comply partially, it -- it talks 

about various trends, et cetera, but it leaves 

out a few that seem to be pretty consequential 

if investors knew about them.

Is that the kind of scenario that you 

say could possibly give rise to liability here 

but it just wasn't pled in this situation?

 MS. COBERLY: Well, in -- first of 

all, in that instance, I'm not sure Item 303 is

 doing very much work.  So we already have the 

classic example, again, from Justice Cardozo

 in -- in Junius Construction of the two roads 

and the one road. 

So the analogy here would be, if the 

complaint had identified a specific statement of 

certain forward-looking trends that were going 

to have an impact and it left out this 

forward-looking trend that was going to have an 

impact, the plaintiff might be able to plead the 

statement requirement by identifying that 

specific statement. 

Now that didn't happen here, but --

that might satisfy --

 MS. COBERLY: That is my response. 

With respect to the question about immunity for

 10(b) liability, we're -- even there, we're not

 seeking immunity exactly.  We're simply saying

 that you have to identify a misleading statement 

and it has to be something that's like in kind.

penalize failures to violate or failures to

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But just 

to -- just to be clear, I guess I'm -- I'm just 

trying to understand, are you making the 

argument that there's something about the nature

rise to liability or there are circumstances 

that you can envision like the one perhaps you 

identified where it might, but they didn't 

allege that in this case?

it has to be something specific to comply with

securities liability can rest.

could be in general the entire MD&A.

 And one of the reasons it's important 

for the PSLRA, I think, to identify something 

more specific is because the MD&A is long and 

complex and covers many different subjects. I

 mean, our client, for example, was a holding 

company that had four different major 

subsidiaries engaged in different businesses.

 It was affected by many regulations.  It, in 

fact, disclosed in its MD&A the possibility that 

regulations that impact the commodities stored 

by this subsidiary could impact the outcome, the 

financial results, of the holding company.  That 

was actually disclosed at a higher level of 

generality.  That did not become misleading 

simply because it did not provide a specific 

example that included this alleged regulation. 

And we -- we want companies to 

disclose what's required under Item 303.  We 

want them to provide that information.  But, if 

we have a rule that says anytime you say 

anything you can be held liable for what you 

don't say, that would have exactly the opposite

 about 10b-5(a) and(c)? Would a 303 omission be 

actionable under either of those subsections, 

and are you asking us to say anything about

 that?

 MS. COBERLY: We are not asking the

 Court to say anything about that necessarily

 because the Second Circuit didn't.  So we did

 not brief that issue as if it was before the 

Court. The Second Circuit did not rely on that. 

But what I can say, Your Honor, is 

that every time this Court has recognized 

liability under (a) and (c), it has found 

something in addition to speech alone.  And if 

it were the case that you could -- this in our 

case is a quintessential (b) case, right?  It's 

about what a 10-K or a 10-Q does or doesn't say. 

And if that case could be recast as a 

scheme case or an act case and avoid the 

specific requirements of (b), no one would ever 

bring a claim under (b).  And, presumably, there 

would be some decision by some court of appeals 

somewhere that held that a misrepresentation or 

omission in a 10-K or a 10-Q can be asserted 

under (a) and (c).  And no court, including the 

Second Circuit, has ever reached that result as

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT MOAB PARTNERS, L.P. 

MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

This case involves a classic 10b-5(b) 

misleading half-truth.  Petitioners disclosed a 

few known trends that would affect their bottom 

line but omitted the IMO 2020 uncertainty that 

would decimate 40 percent of their revenue. 

Just as disclosing two roads near a property 

when a third one actually bisects it is a 

classic fraudulent half-truth, so is a partial 

Item 303 disclosure that omits required material 

information.  A reasonable investor would expect 

the description of known trends to be complete 

and would be misled by such a material omission.

If accepted, Petitioners' argument

 would create a roadmap for fraud.  Petitioners

 knew they were about to lose a substantial part

 of their business but kept their stock price

 artificially inflated by deliberately 

withholding information about their readiness to

 comply with an important rule change.  When the 

truth emerged, their stock price fell by more 

than 40 percent in one day. 

Congress enshrined a private right of 

action to redress this kind of half-truth.  Now 

Petitioners concede that an omission can be a 

half-truth when there is a statement on the same 

subject.  But Item 303 defines the relevant 

subject, any known trends or uncertainties that 

are reasonably likely to significantly affect 

revenues or income. 

So, if a company, as, Mr. Chief 

Justice, your hypothetical pointed out, 

discloses that sales are going to go up by some 

customers, but suppose that the supplier of 

parts is about to go into bankruptcy, both of 

those statements go to the same subject under 

Item 303.  But an omission of one, the 

bankruptcy of the supplier, would materially

they don't give you a standard for determining 

the same subject, it has to be tied to Item 303.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But, even if you

 lose, doesn't the SEC have authority over the

 omission?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Not under 10b-5(b)

 under their theory.  The SEC would only have 

administrative authority through their Corporate 

Finance Department, but they wouldn't have the 

authority to bring a fraud claim that would seek 

other potential remedies.  And the SEC has made 

quite clear that its enforcement staff is meager 

compared to the resources and opportunities for 

institutional investors like the ones that I 

represent to be able to bring private actions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  And so which 

omissions would not be misleading? 

MR. FREDERICK:  Well, omission --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  If pure omissions are 

misleading -- it seems as though you're saying 

the mere fact that it is an omission makes it 

misleading.  Can you -- is there a limit to 

that?

MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, there is, Justice

 Thomas.  And what the Second Circuit did below 

was it went through, essentially, a decision 

tree whether there was a violation of Item 303.

 It asked first, is there a known trend?  Would

 it have -- reasonably affect the bottom line? 

If the answer to that is no, then any omission 

that would not concern a known trend wouldn't be

 required for disclosure.  And if there was an 

uncertainty about that, then the managers are 

asked whether or not disclosing that event would 

be reasonably likely to occur, which is a lower 

standard still. 

The Second Circuit provided those kind 

of prophylactic protections through the decision 

tree that it undertook to determine whether or 

not an omission in these particular contexts 

would be important, and it determined -- and 

this isn't challenged on appeal -- that it was 

objectively unreasonable for the company not to 

put in their Item 303 disclosure the facts that 

would be necessary to determine the company's 

readiness to deal with the IMO 2020 rule change, 

which is going to decimate the 6 oil market. 

And so, for that reason, it seems very

clear to us that when the managers are assessing 

what needs to be in the Item 303 disclosure, 

omitting something that would be so material, as 

was the case here, would be independently

 actionable.

 And I would point out that the

 underlying Second Circuit case that's really on

 appeal here is called Stratte-McClure.  That was 

the precedent on which the per curiam panel 

below relied. 

Stratte-McClure said that omissions 

that were of such materiality would lead the 

financial statements to be misleading.  We think 

what it meant by that was the MD&A part.  And 

the comment is made, well, the MD&A is many 

pages. Well, the statement in a Supreme Court 

brief can be many, many pages.  And so the fact 

that we're not talking about one sentence, but 

we're talking about a statement, is relevant for 

determining what material information reasonable 

investors would want to have.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are -- are you 

-- is one -- the way that the dispute was

 presented at least in some parts is a

 distinction between half-truths and -- and pure

 omissions.

 Are you giving up on that distinction, 

or you don't buy it? I mean, you -- you do not 

buy that distinction at all? 

MR. FREDERICK:  I think their -- what 

they define "pure omission" to be is a violation 

of a disclosure rule.  And if you look at a 

disclosure violation, you have to look at what 

was disclosed compared to what wasn't disclosed. 

And that's the classic half-truth that 

your very first hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, 

brought to light.  And we think, here, where the 

company is talking about some of the material 

trends that would affect their bottom line but 

not the trend that's going to affect nearly half 

of their business, is clearly a material trend 

and a material omission that renders the 

statements that they've made elsewhere in the 

Item 303 disclosure to be misleading.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And you would --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But isn't --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- have to identify

 those specific statements?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, there are two 

answers, Justice Barrett, and I want to be clear 

for the record what our position is.

 We agree with the SG that the 

categorical matter, the statement, is the MD&A. 

So that is an adequate statement if referenced 

in the complaint, which we have on paragraphs 

277 and 278 of our complaint. 

If, however, the Court were to 

conclude that more particularized statements 

within the MD&A needed to be identified, we've 

also done that in the complaint in the preceding 

six or seven paragraphs. 

And so whichever way the Court rules, 

if it accepts the Solicitor General's more 

categorical approach or if it takes the more 

nuanced approach that we have also offered as an 

alternative, we think that you get to the same 

place.

really just repeating the Chief Justice's

 question -- you have put off the table, you're 

not defending the Second Circuit's position,

 which is that there's no statement, however 

capaciously or narrowly defined, there's no 

statement that needs to be alleged becomes

 misleading because of the omission?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's not correct,

 Justice Kagan.  What the Stratte-McClure Court 

said and held was that the omissions rendered 

the financial statement misleading.  And so the 

Second Circuit has viewed the categorical 

position that the government does as the correct 

ruling on the statement. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let -- let's 

just imagine that the Second Circuit said 

something else, which is that any omission 

counts without having to show that it rendered 

any other statement -- misleading. 

You would reject that? 

MR. FREDERICK:  I -- I -- I don't 

think that anybody -- that any court has ever 

held that.  We're not arguing that.  The Second 

Circuit didn't hold that.  It would be purely 

hypothetical.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what everybody is

 arguing about is just sort of how narrow or how 

capacious we should understand the requirement 

that there needs to be another statement that's

 rendered misleading?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I think that's

 basically right in terms of framing the

 battlefield here, Justice Kagan, and that's why 

the subject is what is so important. 

They're willing to concede that there 

can be half-truths when there are omissions on 

the same subject, but they never really make 

clear what is the subject in the context of a 

public filing by a public company to a public 

agency charged with administering particular 

rules designed to protect investors. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can -- can we just 

say that a -- an omission alone is not good 

enough, you have to identify a statement as 

well, and send it back? 

MR. FREDERICK:  I don't think that's 

going to help anyone, Justice Kavanaugh, 

frankly, for this reason. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It'll help us, but

 MR. FREDERICK:  I -- and I appreciate 

my role is to help you, Justice Kavanaugh. But,

 in furtherance of helping the bar, let me urge 

you to say that the omission has to be tied to 

the particular statements at issue, which are,

 here, the MD&A, the management discussion.  That

 has to be the subject in which you evaluate

 omissions and statements. 

It's the only administrable rule where 

you look at what is required under the Item 303 

rule and you determine whether the company 

complied with the form --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, to say the 

MD&A as a whole is misleading really kind of 

waters down the -- the statement requirement. 

At least that's the argument on the other side. 

MR. FREDERICK:  It is. And that's why 

we made the backup argument that if charged with 

looking at particular statements in the MD&A, we 

pleaded that, we can do that, we can establish 

that. 

But I think, Justice Kavanaugh, what's 

important is that when there are material 

omissions of the type and sky -- size and scope

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- content with a 

more specific level of analysis too, and your

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And if you're 

content with it and she's content with it and 

you say it would be helpful for us to go beyond 

talking about omissions, why shouldn't we go 

ahead and do that? 

MR. FREDERICK: Because I think the 

government's position is the more categorical 

one, which we defend as well, and we believe 

that is correct for multiple reasons.  The PSLRA 

doesn't require individual sentences.  It 

requires statements, statements --

the bar, why wouldn't it be helpful for the bar 

to affirm what lower courts have done in that

 respect?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I think she's

 misstated the law of the Second Circuit, is the 

financial statement, and the MD&A is the 

important narrative discussion in the financial

 statement.  So, to the extent that she's talking 

about other courts, the only other court that's 

addressed the question presented directly is the 

Ninth Circuit, which has held categorically that 

no Item 303 violation can give rise to a 10b-5 

claim. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, but we're 

talking about 10b-5 generally. We're now moving 

past the 303 issue as I understand it and 

talking about what it takes to plead a 10b-5(b) 

case generally.

 When --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That -- that might

 be a -- a specific.  I mean, we're going to have 

to argue about that, but that's, I -- I think, 

what lower courts do all the time and say is

 that specific enough.  Is that more like the 

crossroads example that you both have used, or 

is it too far flung to qualify as a statement on 

that subject matter? 

MR. FREDERICK:  And that's why the 

Item 303 framework is a better one than a 

free-floating same-subject test, which is the 

other side's offer. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But do you concede 

that elsewhere in securities law it is more 

specific than that under 10b-5(b) and that --

that courts do require a more specific level of 

granularity than just say it's somewhere in a --

required somewhere in a regulation? 

MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, but that is 

usually in the context of earnings calls, press

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I guess --

MR. FREDERICK:  And --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Sorry.  I guess 

that's my problem, Mr. Frederick, because I'm --

to the extent that the government's general 

categorical view reduces to whenever the company 

is required to make statements, not doing so 

renders the report misleading, I -- I guess I 

don't understand how that's any different than 

just saying pure omissions in a context in which 

there's a regulation that requires you to 

disclose count. 

It seems to me it -- it -- it -- it 

writes out of the statute something about the 

statement being rendered misleading to interpret 

that to mean anytime you are required to 

disclose certain information in a statement and 

it isn't there you have a misleading statement. 

MR. FREDERICK:  But, Justice Jackson, 

the part of the statute that they don't really 

want to talk about is the part that says "in the 

light of the circumstances in -- under which 

they were made."  The circumstances here are the 

regulation requiring disclosure on specific 

topics.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand

 that. But the Chief Justice asked the very

 question that I was going to ask, which is what

 is the difference between a pure omission in a

 world in which you're required to make a 

disclosure and an omission that renders a

 statement misleading?  And if you do it at a 

certain level of generality, I see that there is

 no difference between those two. 

MR. FREDERICK:  And I think there is 

no difference except in the circumstance where 

you simply don't file an MD&A at all.  That is a 

pure omission.  It is as pure as you can be that 

you have violated the rule by simply not 

complying with it. 

Now I'm told that never happens in the 

real world, but that's why this whole pure 

omission thing is a canard for really not 

capturing what is going on in a securities 

action, which are a series of half-truths. 

Here, the difference is that between 

the voluntary scenario where you do have to have 

more specificity about the misleading omissions 

and statements, where you're under a regulatory 

regime that requires certain disclosures and

certain managers' analyses, you have to follow 

the regulation, and the regulation here calls

 for this disclosure.

 Now, Justice Jackson, to be sure, not 

all of those misleading statements or omissions

 are going to give rise to 10b-5 claims.  You

 have to plead -- plead materiality and --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why -- why is

 there a difference in 10(b) and -- and -- and 

Section 11 then?  In other words, how -- how do 

you respond -- it seems to me the Section 11 

argument is what you're saying.  When you're 

required to state something and you don't state 

it, Section 11 says there's liability. 

We have different language in 10b-5. 

So how do you account for that? 

MR. FREDERICK:  Well, 10b-5 is 

intended to be more of a catch-all for a -- a 

provision in which the SEC was intending to 

capture by rule all conceivable forms of fraud. 

Section 11 is a very specific rule capturing 

just the disclosures made in offering documents 

because, once a stock is put on the market 

through an offering document, the offering 

document, all four corners, are supposed to help

the investor identify the worth of the offering.

 Once the offering is made, the market

 takes over, right?  And so the specificity 

required is necessary because Section 11 is a

 strict liability offense.  It does not involve

 scienter.  Fraud requires scienter.

 And so having more particularity with 

respect to the offering document statements in 

that context makes economic sense, and it makes 

governmental sense in the -- in the regard that 

what you're doing is holding the maker of those 

statements strictly liable for messing up by --

either by misleading in some way or omitting 

something that was stated. 

You don't do that in the fraud context 

because you're looking for broader concepts and 

language in which to enforce, and that's why the 

SEC, when it promulgated Rule 10b-5, looked to a 

different provision that did speak to the 

circumstances in which fraud could be conducted. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Frederick, what 

about the question that we agreed to review? 

Now you told us it was a worthless question in 

your brief in opposition.  But, wisely or not, 

we took the case to decide that question.

And based on the argument this morning 

and your briefs, I don't really see a 

disagreement between you and Ms. Coberly on the 

narrow question that the Court agreed to take. 

I understand you to say that when there is a 

material omission in the 303, then a -- a number 

of statements in the 303 can be regarded as

 misleading.  And you need to say that, right, to

 get under 10b-5(b)?  Is that correct? 

MR. FREDERICK:  Well, we need that to 

get under 10b-5(b). We do that multiple ways, 

either categorically because the entire MD&A is 

false and misleading or because the individual 

statements within it are false and misleading. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  I'll 

follow up when --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you 

go ahead now. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the question is 

whether a failure to make a disclosure required 

under Item 303 can support a private claim under 

Section 10(b) -- you'll understand that to refer 

to 10b-5(b) -- "even in the absence of an 

otherwise misleading statement." 

And you're not arguing that as I

understand it. You're arguing that there are

 misleading statements in the 303 because it --

it fails to state things that should have been

 stated.

 MR. FREDERICK: But the opacity of

 that last phrase that you highlighted, Justice 

Alito, is part of my argument. What is an

 otherwise misleading statement depends on

 context.  The context here are the omissions. 

So you might look at a statement and say: 

That's not misleading, except for the fraud and 

omissions that were material to render that 

particular statement otherwise misleading. 

So we argue on the Question Presented 

the Second Circuit has never decided this on the 

basis of pure omissions.  They decided it in the 

context of misleading financial statements.  And 

the "otherwise misleading" gets the half-truth 

theory into the case.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EPHRAIM McDOWELL

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. McDOWELL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 I want to just pick up on this idea 

that the Petitioners are asking for a tight 

factual connection between the statement and --

and the omission. But that ignores the context 

in which an MD&A is -- is made.  The context is 

Item 303. 

Item 303 requires companies to 

disclose all information in a particular 

category.  And in -- when you have that sort of 

regulation, that's the subject matter in which 

you evaluate the statement and omission. 

So just to take the Cardozo case as an 

example, that -- that case was a voluntary 

disclosure case.  There was no disclosure 

regulation at issue.  And in that circumstance, 

we agree that there will need to be some factual 

connection between the statement and the 

omission.

 evaluate the statement and omission.  So just to 

take the facts of that case and -- and vary them 

a bit, suppose there were a regulation in that

 case requiring sellers to disclose to buyers

 everything that could affect the material value

 of the property.  In that circumstance,

 disclosing -- not disclosing a nearby factory

 would be misleading, even though, even in a

 voluntary disclosure case, it might not be 

misleading, and there would need to be a tight 

subject matter connection. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But aren't you too 

saying that as long as it's material, the 

omission is material, that it satisfied 

10b-5(b)? 

MR. McDOWELL:  No, Your Honor.  We're 

saying that it has -- there has to be an Item 3 

-- Item 303 violation, it has to be material 

under this Court's decision in Basic, which is a 

different materiality standard than Item 303 

itself, and then there has to be scienter as 

well. So there are multiple different elements 

beyond just materiality.

what's the difference between what you're saying

 seemed to suggest that an additional statement 

is required. You're saying at least from what 

I'm hearing that it has to be material, and I

 take as a grant it's scienter, okay?  But I

 don't see that that adds anything more other

 than it's a -- it's a pure omission that is 

material. 

MR. McDOWELL:  No, Your Honor, because 

we're saying that the statement here is the 

MD&A's narrative discussion and analysis as a 

whole, and when you have an omission that 

satisfies the Item 303 standard, that renders 

that entire narrative misleading because --

you could have an omission if you don't have the

even have the omission ab initio if you don't 

have the 303 statement, and it is from that

 statement that we're talking about the omission,

 the omission beyond -- nothing beyond that, a 

material omission from the 303 statement.

 MR. McDOWELL:  Your Honor, that -- our 

position is that if you have a material omission 

from the 303 statement, that would be -- that

 would give -- that could give rise to liability. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

MR. McDOWELL:  And the reason for that 

is because reasonable investors will expect the 

MD&A to disclose all known trends or 

uncertainties.  So, when you omit one, then 

you're violating those reasonable investor 

expectations. 

Now there's been some discussion about 

the specificity of the statement required here. 

But, as my colleague suggested, the ordinary 

meaning of "statement" includes a narrative 

discussion and analysis like --

a whole is misleading because reasonable --

 investors will assume that it is complete in

 light of Item 303.  There may also be individual

 statements that are specifically misleading, as 

my colleague suggested, but our position is the 

categorical one that the entire MD&A is the

 statement and that's what's been rendered

 misleading by the omission.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And won't that 

always mean then that a omission -- an Item 303 

omission qualifies? 

MR. McDOWELL:  No, Your Honor, 

because, first of all, it has to meet the -- the 

standards of Item 303 itself, which requires 

that the trend or uncertainty be currently 

known, reasonably likely to occur, and 

reasonably likely to be material. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  But once 

you have that? 

MR. McDOWELL:  Once you have that, 

then you would also have to show materiality 

under Basic, which is oftentimes a higher 

threshold, as well as scienter.  So we're just 

talking about one element of the Rule 10b-5 

claim.

But, yes, as to the misleading

 omission element, our position is that when 

there is an Item 303 violation, that would 

satisfy that one element. 

And just to understand why we think

 the right way to think about the statement is 

the MD&A as a whole, I want to give you an

 example of a slightly more straightforward SEC

 disclosure regulation, which is Item 401. 

That requires companies to list all 

the directors on the board of directors of the 

company.  If a company omits one of those 

directors from the disclosure, that omission 

doesn't render misleading the identification of 

any other individual director, but it does 

render misleading the company's larger statement 

that this is our full board of directors. 

The same analysis applies here.  Item 

303 requires companies to disclose all material 

known trends or uncertainties.  So, if you omit 

one, that doesn't render it -- the 

identification of any other one misleading, but 

it does render misleading the holistic statement 

that these are all the known trends or 

uncertainties affecting the company's financial

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I can see that.  And

 I -- I think Ms. Coberly agreed, but I guess I'm 

trying to figure out the difference between the

 language of 10b-5 with respect to this issue and

 Section 11. 

The government's position it seems to 

me renders those two the same in this context 

because Section 11 says that you may sue when a 

regulated party has "omitted to state a material 

fact required to be stated." 

And in this context, you're saying 

that to the extent that Item 303 requires these 

trends and uncertainties to be stated, if they 

are omitted, we should consider that to count or 

satisfy the additional language in Section 10b-5 

that talks about your -- you needing to have a 

misleading statement. 

MR. McDOWELL:  With respect, Justice 

Jackson, that's not correct because Section 11 

goes on to say "or necessary to make the 

statements therein not misleading."  So Section 

11 speaks to both pure omissions and half-truths 

expressly. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.

They're distinct categories.  So a pure omission 

would occur, for instance, if a company did not 

file an MD&A at all or, in the context of 

Section 11, if they omitted an entire category 

within a registration statement. 

By contrast, a -- a half-truth is when

and that renders the entire statement within

 that category misleading.  So that's the

 distinction here, and --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And do you think the 

Second Circuit appreciated that distinction in

 its opinion?  Because I -- I sort of thought

 that they were saying the first.

 MR. McDOWELL:  So, Your Honor, the

 Second Circuit's decision is unpublished.  It 

has fairly limited reasoning. And I read it to 

basically cite and adopt the Second Circuit's 

precedential opinion on this issue, which is 

Stratte-McClure. 

And Stratte-McClure does rely on, as I 

read it, a half-truths theory because it says 

that the -- an Item 303 violation renders the 

financial statement misleading, which I take to 

mean the MD&A, and that's exactly our position. 

So I do think that the actual 

precedent within the Second Circuit does agree 

with our position, and I don't think it would do 

any good to just say -- to just basically say 

vacate and remand and -- and let them take 

another look because Stratte-McClure does decide 

this issue in the way that we think about it.

The other -- the other point I wanted

 to make about the PSLRA's pleading standard is I

 think they're -- the other side is suggesting 

that that pleading standard can substantively

 limit the scope of subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5. 

But that gets the analysis backwards because, if 

you look at the pleading standard and it's at 

page 11 of the addendum to the red brief, the

 pleading standard just tracks the language of 

subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5.  It doesn't 

purport to change or restrict that language. 

So I would read the PSLRA's pleading 

standard in light of the longstanding provision 

of subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5, not the other 

way around. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel --

MR. McDOWELL: So the only question --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- do you agree with 

Ms. Coberly, though, that lower courts have 

understood the PLSRA to require a more specific 

statement identification than you're proposing 

here? 

MR. McDOWELL:  No, Justice Gorsuch, 

not in this context, because this --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No.  No, no, no.

MR. McDOWELL:  Yes.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I do understand

MR. McDOWELL:  Yes. So -- and 

that distinct -- that distinction is critical 

because, when you have a regulation like this 

calling for all information in a particular 

category, the omission of information in that 

category will necessarily be misleading. 

And just to take a step back and put 

the MD&A in context, it's part of a Form 10-K. 

And a Form 10-K document really is like a 

Question & Answer document with discrete 

categories, and as with any Q&A document, you 

can only understand an answer in light of the 

question being asked.

right of action?

 MR. McDOWELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I 

actually think that this issue is exactly like

 the issue you've -- your opinion faces -- faced

 in Halliburton.  In Halliburton, the -- there 

was an established element of reliance, and the

 Court said that you can point to a different way

 of satisfying an established element after the

 PSLRA. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh -- well, 

but, I mean, it was the same principle that was 

being applied.  Here, it's a different expansion 

under 303, an entirely different thing that we 

hadn't mentioned in any of our prior implied 

right of action jurisprudence. 

MR. McDOWELL:  With respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A substantive 

addition rather than applying the same rule in a 

different context. 

MR. McDOWELL:  So I would make two 

points about that, Mr. Chief Justice. 

First, we are not relying on a new 

theory.  We're relying on the half-truth theory, 

which has existed since 1942 when the SEC passed 

Rule 10b-5. We're just saying that this fits

within the half-truth theory, just like in --

just like you said in Halliburton the basic 

presumption of reliance fits within the

 long-settled element of reliance.

 The other thing I would say about this 

is I think Petitioners are over-reading this 

Court's decisions in Stoneridge and Janus. We 

read those decisions to reject attempts to 

expand the class of defendants who can be liable 

under Rule 10b-5 after the PSLRA. We don't read 

them to say that you can't simply plead an -- an 

old type of securities claim in a slightly new 

way.

MR. McDOWELL:  And so that's the 

distinction.

Thomas?

MR. McDOWELL:  The answer is that an 

Item 303 violation can form the basis for a Rule

 10b-5 claim.  And Ms. Coberly I don't take to be

 saying that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that wasn't the 

question we granted review on. Even in the 

absence of an otherwise misleading statement.

 MR. McDOWELL:  Right.  And I read 

"otherwise misleading" to be misleading in 

its -- in its own -- on it -- by its own terms. 

We are saying that it doesn't have to be 

misleading on its own terms, but when you put it 

in the context of Item 303 disclosures, that's 

what makes it misleading. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, don't you have 

to identify a statement or a number of 

statements, even if it's every single statement 

in the 303, that is otherwise misleading to 

bring -- to bring it within 10b-5(b)? 

MR. McDOWELL:  You do have to identify 

a statement, and we would say that the MD&A's 

narrative is the relevant statement.  And 

there's nothing atypical about reading 

statements --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Then there's an 

otherwise misleading statement, which is part of

 the question.

 MR. McDOWELL:  Well, with respect, 

Justice Alito, I don't think it gets you very 

far to answer the question that way because, as 

I mentioned earlier, the Second Circuit has

 already adopted our position on -- on the 

half-truths --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  Well, do you 

think the requirement to -- to identify the 

Question Presented means, particularly with 

respect to an amicus, the question that you 

would like us to address to provide guidance to 

the bar or to advance your interests?  Do you 

think that's what the requirement is? 

MR. McDOWELL:  No, Your Honor.  We 

answered the Question Presented by saying an 

Item 303 violation can give rise to a Rule 10b-5

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Quick question. 

The Commission enforces Item 303, correct?

 MR. McDOWELL:  That's right.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And Mr. Frederick 

referred to that as meager. Do you have a

 response to that?

 (Laughter.) 

MR. McDOWELL:  So -- so I think -- so 

I do have a response to that.  I do think that 

the SEC's resources in this area are -- are 

limited.  This Court has repeatedly said that 

private litigation under Rule 10b-5 is an 

essential supplement to SEC enforcement actions. 

And that applies with full force here. 

The SEC has a few hundred employees 

that are tasked with reviewing tens of thousands 

of forms from registered companies each year, 

and it's simply not realistic to think that 

those employees will be able to routinely 

detect, investigate, and penalize the many 

disclosure violations that are taking place.

 MR. McDOWELL:  I -- I don't know that 

they would. I mean, I think that's -- that's a

 bit speculative to think that.  But I -- it may 

-- perhaps in some cases.  But I would say also 

that the difference here is between enforcing it 

pursuant to Section 13 as opposed to Rule 10b-5,

 and there are greater penalties that the SEC can 

seek when they go under Rule 10b-5.  And when 

there is an intentionally deceptive disclosure 

violation, I think it makes good sense to allow 

the SEC to pursue those additional penalties.

 10-Ks and 10-Qs, every company, and every 

company has to comply with Item 303 and provide

 an MD&A.

 Item 303 refers to the MD&A as a 

whole, and its function and purpose is to allow 

investors to see the company from the 

perspective of management. So the rule that you 

heard from both Moab and the government is

 tantamount to a rule that we don't have to -- a 

plaintiff doesn't have to identify a specific 

statement, a specific misleading statement, 

within the financial statements or the MD&A as 

long as that information was required to be 

disclosed by Item 303. 

That is functionally the pure omission 

theory that the Second Circuit adopted and that 

we object to.  It's also tantamount to a 

requirement to -- to a definition of omission 

that includes the words "required to be stated," 

which appears in Section 11 but conspicuously 

not in Section -- in Rule 10b-5(b). 

The Commission had as its model for 

Rule 10b-5(b) both Section 11 and Section 

17(a)(2), and it didn't choose to follow the 

omission definition in Section -- in Section 11,

and I think we need to attribute some

 consequence to that.

 Further, counsel referred to a 

hypothetical that said, if you're required to 

list all of your executives and you list most of

 them, but you leave one out, that could be a

 misleading statement.  I agree, and that's the

 statement that should be pleaded in the

 complaint, the paragraph, the sentence that 

lists in -- that provides an incomplete list of 

the executives. 

The fact that something was required 

to be disclosed actually doesn't add very much 

to the analysis there.  It -- the -- the 

statement would be misleading on its face 

whether or not there was a requirement to 

disclose.  So we think that actually supports 

the notion that a specific statement needs to be 

identified. 

Now counsel for Moab argue that they 

did identify specific statements, and that's 

very interesting because the brief in opposition 

doesn't mention them.  Neither did the 

paragraphs in the complaint that purported to 

state this theory based on Item 303.  Now I

assume that's because they were relying on the

 Second Circuit's rule in Stratte-McClure that 

said that you don't have to identify specific 

misleading statements when you are pleading

 something that is a violation of Item 303.

 And if you look at those paragraphs in

 the complaint, paragraphs 277 and 278, they do

 not refer to any specific misleading statement,

 any paragraph or sentence where a list was given 

that was incomplete, for example. 

In order for that kind of analysis to 

-- analogy to apply here, there would need to be 

a list that was incomplete, and the plaintiff 

would need to identify it and point to it and 

say that's why -- say why the statement is 

misleading.  And then we would have the 

opportunity to address that statement in a 

motion to dismiss. 

Now the theory that you heard counsel 

for Moab articulate here is actually in some 

ways the theory that they pleaded in their 

complaint and that they lost in the district 

court and in the Second Circuit. Their 

complaint went through very specific statements, 

listing them, and it was not only in the

 voluntary statements, as counsel for the

 government referenced. 

The plaintiff in this case followed 

the common practice in district courts across 

the nation, which is to list the specific parts 

of not only the transcripts of calls but the

 10-Qs and the 10-Ks.  It went on for pages and

 pages. And they said here's a specific 

statement in the Ks and Qs, and here's why we 

think it's misleading. 

The district court looked at those 

statements and it concluded that no claim had 

been stated, and that's because many of the 

statements were forward-looking, some of them 

were statements of opinion, others in context 

were not misleading by omission. The district 

court dismissed the case based on those specific 

statements. 

The Second Circuit did not revive it, 

with the exception of the two specific 

statements that Justice Sotomayor pointed out, 

which the court found to be pleaded allegedly 

misleading because of a very specific factual 

omission about the content of the base of 

customers.

 claim the -- the Second Circuit allowed to 

proceed is a far broader claim that allows a --

a -- a case to proceed based simply on the

 notion that there's an omission of something

 needs to vacate.
