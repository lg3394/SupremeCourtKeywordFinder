3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning in Case 23-719, Trump versus Anderson. 

5 Mr. Mitchell. 

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. MITCHELL 

7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8 MR. MITCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

9 it please the Court: 

10 The Colorado Supreme Court held that 

11   President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally 

12   disqualified from serving as president under 

13 Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Colorado 

14 Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be 

15   reversed for numerous independent reasons. 

16 The first reason is that President Trump is 

17 not covered by Section 3 because the president is not 

18 "an officer of the United States" as that term is 

19 used throughout the Constitution.  "Officer of the 

20   United States" refers only to appointed officials, 

21 and it does not encompass elected individuals, such 

22 as the President or members of Congress.  This is 

23 clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment 

24 Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which 

25 uses "officers of the United States" to refer only to

1   appointed and not elected officials. 

2 The second reason is that Section 3 cannot 

3 be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the 

4 ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from 

5 serving as president under Section 3 because Congress 

6 can lift that disability after the candidate is 

7 elected but before he takes office.  A state cannot 

8 exclude any candidate for federal office from the 

9 ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that 

10 does so is violating the holding of Term Limits by 

11   altering the Constitution's qualifications for 

12 federal office. 

13 The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is no 

14   different from a state residency law that requires 

15 members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to 

16 Election Day, when the Constitution requires only 

17 that members of Congress inhabit the state that they 

18   represent when elected. 

19 In both situations, a state is accelerating 

20 the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed 

21   qualification and is thereby violating the holding of 

22 Term Limits.  And in this situation, a ruling from 

23 this Court that affirms the decision below would not 

24 only violate Term Limits but take away the votes of 

25   potentially tens of millions of Americans.

1 I welcome the Court's questions. 

2 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Mitchell, would you --

3 you didn't spend much time on your argument with 

4 respect to whether or not Section 3 is 

5   self-executing, so would you address that? 

6 And -- and in doing that, your argument is 

7 that it's not self-executing, but then, in that case, 

8 what would the role of the state be, or is it 

9   entirely up to Congress to implement the 

10   disqualification in Section 3? 

11 MR. MITCHELL:  It is entirely up to 

12   Congress, Justice Thomas.  And our argument goes 

13   beyond actually saying that Section 3 is 

14   non-self-executing.  We need to say something more 

15 than that because a non-self-executing treaty or a 

16   non-self-executing constitutional provision normally 

17 can still be enforced by a state if it chooses to 

18 enact legislation. 

19 The holding of Griffin's Case goes beyond 

20 even that by saying that a state is not allowed to 

21   implement or enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth 

22   Amendment unless and until Congress enacts 

23   implementing legislation allowing it to do so. So, 

24 under Griffin's Case, which we believe is correctly 

25 decided -- the Anderson litigants disagree with us on

1 that point -- but, if this Court were to adhere to 

2 the holding of Griffin's Case, there would not be any 

3 role for the states in enforcing Section 3 unless 

4   Congress were to enact a statute that gives them that 

5   authority. 

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what if 

7 somebody came into a state secretary of state's 

8   office and said, I took the oath specified in Section 

9 3, I participated in an insurrection, and I want to 

10 be on the ballot?  Can the -- does the secretary of 

11 state have the authority in that situation to say, 

12   no, you're disqualified? 

13 MR. MITCHELL:  No, the secretary of state 

14 could not do that, consistent with Term Limits, 

15 because even if the candidate is an admitted 

16   insurrectionist, Section 3 still allows the candidate 

17 to run for office and even win election to office and 

18 then see whether Congress lifts that disability after 

19 the election. 

20 This happened frequently in the wake of the 

21   Fourteenth Amendment, where Confederate 

22 insurrectionists were elected to Congress, and 

23   sometimes they obtained a waiver; sometimes they did 

24 not. And each House would determine for itself 

25 whether to seat that elected insurrectionist because

1 each House is the sole judge of the qualifications of 

2 its members. 

3 So, if a state banned even an admitted 

4   insurrectionist from the ballot, it would be adding 

5 to and altering the Constitution's qualifications for 

6 office because, under Section 3, the candidate need 

7 only qualify during the time the candidate holds the 

8 office to which he's been elected.  And under Your 

9 Honor's hypothetical, the secretary of state would be 

10 demanding essentially that the candidate obtain a 

11 waiver from Congress earlier than the candidate needs 

12 to obtain that waiver. 

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even though 

14 it's pretty unlikely or at least would be difficult 

15 for an individual who says, you know, I -- I am an 

16   insurrectionist and I had taken the oath, that would 

17 require a two-thirds of votes in Congress, right? 

18 MR. MITCHELL:  Correct. 

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a 

20   pretty unlikely scenario. 

21 MR. MITCHELL:  It may be unlikely, but no 

22 secretary of state is permitted to predict the 

23   likelihood of a waiver because, in doing so, they're 

24 adding a new qualification to the ability to run for 

25   Congress.

1 And the proper analogy, Mr. Chief Justice, 

2 is to state residency laws because the Constitution 

3 says that a member of Congress must inhabit the state 

4 that he represents when elected.  And the lower 

5 courts have all held, in reliance on Term Limits, 

6 that a state election official cannot move that 

7   deadline any earlier by requiring the candidate for 

8   Congress to inhabit the state --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if somebody 

10 --

11 MR. MITCHELL:  -- before the date of 

12   election. 

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- comes in and 

14 says, I'm -- I'm a -- a resident of -- to the 

15 secretary of state's office in Illinois and says, I'm 

16 a -- a resident of Indiana, I have been all my life, 

17 I want to run for office in Illinois, the secretary 

18 of state can't say, no, you can't? 

19 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, the question would be 

20 is that person going to inhabit the state when the 

21   election is held.  So, if the candidate makes clear, 

22 perhaps through a sworn declaration or through his 

23 own statements, that he has no intention of

3 And that's the key under Term Limits:  Is 

4 the state in any way altering the criteria for a 

5 federal office, either for Congress or for the 

6   presidency?  And in this situation, the Colorado 

7 Supreme Court is going slightly beyond what Section 3 

8   requires because Section 3 on its face bans an 

9   insurrectionist only from holding office. 

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I stop you 

11 a moment and -- and back up a minute? You admitted 

12 that the concept of self-executing does generally 

13   permit states to provide a cause of action for 

14   breaches of a constitutional provision. 

15 MR. MITCHELL:  Correct. 

16            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In fact, they do it 

17   frequently for takings clauses. Here's -- there's no 

18 debate that Colorado has placed that -- provided that 

19 cause of action. You want to go a step further and 

20 say that this, like the Treaty Clause, requires 

21   implementing legislation to permit the state to 

22   disqualify an insurrectionist --

23 MR. MITCHELL:  That's correct.  So --

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and to my colleagues 

5   generally.  There's a whole lot of examples of states 

6 relying on Section 3 to disqualify insurrectionists 

7 for state offices, and you're basically telling us 

8 that you want us to go two steps further. You want 

9 to -- maybe three. 

10 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You want us to say that 

12   self-execution doesn't mean what it generally means.

14   permit states or require states to stop 

15   insurrectionists from taking state office.

4 treated -- and this is his words --

5 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- Section 3 as 

7 executing itself, needing no legislation on the part 

8 of Congress to give it effect. 

9 So you're relying on a non-precedential

12   Griffin's Case and why it's an important precedent, 

13 despite everything Your Honor said, it is not a 

14   precedent of this Court, but Griffin's Case provided 

15 the backdrop against which Congress legislated the 

16 Enforcement Act of 1870 when it first provided an 

17   enforcement mechanism for Section 3.

1 one that I go back to that I started with, and -- and 

2 very briefly, what sense does it say that states 

3 can't enforce Section 3 against their own officials? 

4 MR. MITCHELL:  Because --

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I think, logically, 

6 those are two separate issues in my mind: Can states 

7 enforce the Insurrection Clause against their own 

8   officeholders, or can they enforce it against federal 

9   officials, or can they enforce it against the 

10   president?  Those are all three different questions 

11 in my mind. 

12 MR. MITCHELL:  And the -- the answer to all 

13 three of those questions turns on whether this Court 

14 agrees with the holding of Griffin's Case.  If 

15   Griffin's Case is the proper enunciation of the law, 

16 then a state cannot do any of the things Your Honor 

17 suggested unless Congress gives it authority to do so 

18 through implementing legislation.  So --

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So a non-precedential 

20   decision that relies on policy, doesn't look at the 

21 language, doesn't look at the history, doesn't 

22 analyze anything than the disruption that such a suit 

23 would bring, you want us to credit as precedential?

2 these decisions -- the initial enactment of the 

3   Enforcement Act in 1870, the repeal of the quo 

4   warranto provisions in 1948 -- all of those were made 

5 with Griffin's Case as the backdrop.  The under --

6 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- please. 

7 MR. MITCHELL: Well, the understanding was 

8 that these congressionally established remedies would 

9 be exclusive of state court remedies. So there's not 

10 an express statement of preemption in these statutes, 

11 but there didn't need to be because Griffin's Case 

12   provided the backdrop. 

13 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I could just 

14   understand the argument a little bit better, suppose 

15 that we took all of that away.  You know, suppose 

16 there were no Griffin's Case and there were no 

17   subsequent congressional enactment.  What do you then 

18 think the rule would be? 

19 MR. MITCHELL:  So in just as a matter of 

20 first principles without Griffin's Case, it's a much 

21   harder argument for us to make because, normally, I 

22 mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth 

23 Amendment has been treated as self-executing.

1   practical considerations unique to Section 3 that 

2 counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief 

3 Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's Case and it 

4 goes to I think the policy concerns he talks about, 

5 where this was a case -- Griffin's Case involved a 

6 convicted criminal who was seeking a writ of habeas 

7 corpus on the ground that the judge who tried his 

8 case was an insurrectionist disqualified under 

9 Section 3, and Chief Justice Chase realizes that if 

10 he enforces Section 3 in this situation, it would 

11 nullify every official act taken not only by this 

12   particular judge but by anyone who is an 

13 insurrectionist or arguably an insurrectionist under 

14 Section 3, and that was --

15 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, why do you need 

16 those consequential concerns, though?  I mean, it 

17 kind of seems to me that what Justice Kagan is 

18 getting at is why don't you have an argument that the 

19 Constitution of its own force, that Section 3 of its 

20 own force, preempts the states' ability not -- not 

21   necessarily, I think, not to enforce Section 3 

22 against its own officers but against federal

4 We could rely on precedents such as McClung 

5 that says that state courts lack the authority to 

6 issue mandamus relief against federal officials and 

7 extend that principle here. 

8 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, why aren't you 

9   making those arguments? 

10 MR. MITCHELL:  Because that doesn't get us 

11 -- that -- Griffin's Case --

12 JUSTICE BARRETT:  That only gets you out of 

13 state court, it doesn't get you out of federal court? 

14 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  And also the holding 

15 of Griffin's Case went well beyond that because Chief 

16 Justice Chase said in this opinion, which, again, 

17 provided the backdrop for the congressional 

18   enforcement legislation, that states had no role in 

19 enforcing Section 3 unless Congress was to give them 

20    that authority through a statute that they passed 

21   pursuant to their -- powers. 

22 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I --

23 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But your argument's --

24 oh, sorry.

1 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I was just going to add 

2 one last thing. I think your argument's a little 

3 broader than that because I think, if we accept your 

4 position that disqualifying someone from the ballot 

5 is adding a qualification, really, your position is 

6 that Congress can't enact a statute that would allow 

7   Colorado to do what it's done either because then 

8   Congress would be adding a qualification, which it 

9 can't do either. 

10 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I don't agree with that, 

11 Justice Barrett.  Congress is not bound by the 

12 holding of Term Limits.  Term Limits only prohibits 

13 the states from adding additional qualifications or 

14   altering the Constitution's qualifications for 

15 federal office.  It does not purport to restrain 

16   Congress. 

17 So, if Congress were to enact implementing 

18   legislation that authorized the states to exclude 

19 insurrectionists from the ballot, we believe that 

20 would be valid enforcement legislation under Section 

21 3 with an important caveat.  There has to be 

22   congruence and proportionality under this Court's 

23   precedents.  So Congress --

24 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why would that be an 

25   important -- why would that be permissible? Because

1 Section 3 refers to the holding of office, not 

2 running for office.  And so --

3 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

4 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- if a state or Congress 

5 were to go further and say that you can't run for the 

6 office, you can't compete in a primary, wouldn't that 

7 be adding an additional qualification for serving for 

8   president?  You must have been free from this --

9   disqualification at an earlier point in time than 

10 Section 3 specifies. 

11 MR. MITCHELL:  I think the answer to your 

12 question, Justice Alito, depends on how you interpret 

13 the word "enforce" in Section 5. And some members of 

14 this Court, such as Justice Scalia, thought that 

15 "enforce" means you can do nothing more than enact 

16   legislation that mirrors the Fourteenth Amendment's 

17   self-executing requirements and you can't go an inch 

18   beyond that.  That's not the current jurisprudence of 

19 this Court --

20 JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  Well, all right.  We 

21 have --

1 JUSTICE ALITO:  And we would get into the 

2 question of whether that would be congruent and 

3   proportional. 

4 Well, let me shift gear a little bit.  I --

5 I take you to -- to argue -- and I think this is 

6 right -- that the term "self-executing" is a misnomer 

7 as applied here. 

8 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, it is. 

9 JUSTICE ALITO:  Very often, when we use the 

10 term, what we're referring to is the proposition that 

11 a particular provision of the Constitution or a 

12 statute in and of itself creates a private right of 

13 action. That's not what the issue is here. 

14 MR. MITCHELL:  No, that's not the issue 

15 here. And sometimes the phrase "self-executing" is 

16 used that way. The only thing I would add is 

17   sometimes it's used in a different sense.  With 

18   self-executing treaties or non-self-executing 

19 treaties, the issue is whether that treaty has any 

20 force as domestic law whatsoever. 

21 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. Right. Well, I 

22 don't see what is gained by using this term which is 

23 used in different contexts rather than directly 

24   addressing what's involved here, which is the 

25 question of who can enforce Section 3 with respect to

2 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

3 JUSTICE ALITO:  The consequences of what 

4 the Colorado Supreme Court did, some people claim, 

5 would be quite severe.  Would it not permit -- would 

6 it not lead to the possibility that other states 

7 would say, using their choice-of-law rules and their 

8 rules on -- on collateral estoppel, that there's 

9   non-mutual collateral estoppel against former 

10 President Trump and so the decision of the Colorado 

11 Supreme Court could effectively decide this question 

12 for many other states, perhaps all other states? 

13 Could it not lead to that consequence? 

14 MR. MITCHELL:  I don't think so because 

15   Colorado law does not recognize non-mutual collateral 

16   estoppel.  And I believe the preclusive effect of the 

17   decision would be determined by Colorado law rather 

18 than the law of another state. 

19 But I think your question, Justice Alito, 

20 gives rise to an -- an even greater concern because, 

21 if this decision does not have preclusive effect in 

22 other lawsuits, it opens the possibility that a 

23 different factual record could be developed in some 

24 of the litigation that occurs in other states, and 

25 different factual findings could be entered by state

2 of fact that President Trump did not have any intent 

3 to engage in incitement or make some other finding 

4 that differs from what this trial court judge found. 

5 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, exactly.  So this --

6 in this decision, the -- the trial court in Colorado 

7 thought that it was proper to admit the January 6th 

8 report, and it also admitted the testimony of an 

9 expert --

15 JUSTICE ALITO:  Another -- another state 

16 court could reach an opposite conclusion on both of 

17 those questions. 

18 MR. MITCHELL:  Certainly.  Other states 

19 could conclude that the January 6th report is 

20   inadmissible hearsay.  They might also conclude that 

21   statements within the January 6th report were hearsay

4 MR. MITCHELL:  Okay.  With respect to the

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mm-hmm. 

7 MR. MITCHELL:  If a state like Colorado 

8 says you can't appear on our presidential ballot 

9 unless you are 35 years old on the day of the 

10   election, that would be a violation of Term Limits 

11 because there could be a 34-year-old on the day of 

12 the election who turns 35 before Inauguration Day. 

13 What Colorado has done here, what their 

14 Supreme Court has done, is similar because, under 

15 Section 3, President Trump needs to qualify during 

16 the time that he would hold office, and the Colorado 

17 Supreme Court is saying to President Trump:  You have 

18 to show that you would qualify under Section 3 now, 

19 at the time of the election, or at the time that we, 

20 the state supreme court --

2 way Section 3 could be enforced is through 

3   congressional legislation that creates a remedy. So 

4   Congress could reinstate the quo warranto provisions 

5 that they initially had in the 1870 --

6 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that your position? 

7 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, because we believe 

8   Griffin's Case is correctly decided and should be 

9   followed --

10 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and how does that 

11 fit with -- a lot of the -- the -- the answers to the 

12   questions that we've been giving, you said, well, 

13   Congress has to have the ability by a two-thirds vote 

14 to lift the disqualification. 

15 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. 

16 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But so too I would -- I

1 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah, there certainly is 

2 some tension, Justice Kagan, and some commentators 

3 have pointed this out.  Professor Baude and Professor 

4 Paulsen criticized Griffin's Case very sharply. 

5 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then I must be right. 

6            (Laughter.) 

7 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, we don't think it's --

8 we don't think this problem is fatal because, to us, 

9 the -- the two-thirds provision that allows Congress 

10 to lift a disability is something akin to a pardon 

11   power, where Congress, through enforcement 

12   legislation, creates a mechanism by which the 

13   insurrectionist issue is to be determined by some 

14 entity, it could be the legislature in the case of an 

15 elected member of Congress, each House has the 

16 ability to judge the qualifications of their members, 

17 or if it's outside the situation of Congress, it 

18 would be whatever Congress enacts. 

19 So, when it was the writs of quo warranto, 

20 each federal prosecutor had the authority to bring a 

21 quo warranto writ against an incumbent official and 

22 seek his ouster from office under Section 3, but it 

23 was still subject to that amnesty provision in 

24 Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

1 don't think that's an insurmountable obstacle to our 

2 view of the case. 

3 JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I don't even see why 

4 there's -- why there's a tension.  If you analogize 

5 the -- the lifting by Congress of the 

6   disqualification by a two-thirds vote to a pardon, 

7 then, surely, one would not argue that the fact that 

8 the president or a governor can pardon someone from a 

9   criminal conviction or a criminal offense means that 

10   the person couldn't be prosecuted in the first place 

11 for the criminal offense. 

12 MR. MITCHELL:  That's right. 

13 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right? 

14 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. 

15 JUSTICE ALITO:  So I don't see what the 

16 tension is. They're two separate things.  Did the 

17 person engage in this activity which is prohibited, 

18 and second, even if the person did engage in the 

19   activity, are there reasons why the disqualification 

20 or the -- should be lifted or the pardon should be 

21   granted. 

22 MR. MITCHELL:  That's right.  I mean, if --

23 again, if the Court accepts the holding of Griffin's 

24 Case, that's exactly the regime that we would have, 

25 like the Court described.

5 on what one can infer from the mere fact that 

6   Congress can lift the disqualification.  You can't 

7 infer from that that it is impermissible to have a 

8 prior determination that the person did engage in the 

9   insurrection.  You can't make that inference.

14   you're doing? 

15 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- what's -- what's --

16 what's -- what's -- what's in tension is that you 

17 would have the exact same actor and say, look, that 

18 actor can lift --

19 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. 

20 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the disqualification by 

21 a two-thirds vote. 

22 But you're saying only that actor can put 

23 the disqualification into effect in the first place 

24 and it can do that by far less than two-thirds.  It 

25 can do that just by a simple majority of one House.

1   Fourteenth Amendment is?  It's by the Chief Justice 

2 of the United States a year after the Fourteenth 

3   Amendment.  That seems to me --

4 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. 

5 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- highly probative of 

6 what the meaning or understanding of that language, 

7   otherwise elusive language, is. 

8 MR. MITCHELL:  I do think it's probative, 

9 Justice Kavanaugh. We didn't rely too heavily on the 

10 point that you're making, partly because we have this 

11 other opinion from Justice Chase in the Jefferson 

12 Davis case.  So that argument could potentially 

13   boomerang on us, which is why we didn't push it very 

14 hard in our briefing. 

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

17 right. This is --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why don't 

19 you finish your sentence and then we'll move on. 

20 MR. MITCHELL:  Just it is -- it is relevant 

21 and probative for sure, but I think there is other 

22   evidence too that might perhaps undercut the 

23   usefulness of trying to characterize Griffin's Case 

24 as completely emblematic of the original

3 MR. MITCHELL:  Certainly. 

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, Justice 

5   Jackson, I think you --

6 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. So I had a question 

7 about it because you're making a textualist argument. 

8 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

9 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And as I look at Section 

10 3, I see two parts of the first sentence of Section 

11 3. 

12 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

13 JUSTICE JACKSON:  The first is a list of 

14 offices that a disqualified person is barred from 

15   holding, and the second are specific circumstances 

16 that give rise to disqualification. 

17 So, first, am I right about seeing that 

18 there are two different things happening in the first 

19   sentence? 

20 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, for sure. 

21 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  So are you arguing

3 which really help us on the "officer of the United 

4 States" argument in that second part of Section 3 but 

5   somewhat cut against us when it comes to "office 

6 under the United States." 

7 And the Anderson litigants point this out 

8 in Footnote 9 in the red brief where they say, if 

9 this Court were to say the presidency is an excluded 

10   office under the United States, that could imply, for

2 closely related would carry such different weight? 

3 MR. MITCHELL:  Because it's clear from the 

4   constitutional text that there are officers that do 

5 not hold offices under the United States, for 

6   example, the Speaker of the House and the President 

7 Pro Tempore.  They're described as officers in 

8 Article I who are chosen by the legislature. 

9 They also have to be officers if they're 

10 able to be covered by the Presidential Succession Act 

11   because, under the Constitution, only officers can 

12 serve when there's a vacancy in both the presidency 

13 and the vice presidency. 

14 So they're officers, but they're not 

15 offices under the United States because of the 

16 Incompatibility Clause, which says that if you're a 

17 member of Congress, you cannot simultaneously hold an 

18   office under the United States. So that provision of 

19 the Constitution clearly demonstrates that --

21 MR. MITCHELL:  -- members of Congress can't 

22 hold offices. 

23 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I -- I appreciate that

25 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.

1            JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- response.  Is -- is 

2 there anything in the original drafting, history, 

3   discussion that you think illuminates why that 

4   distinction would carry such profound weight? 

5 MR. MITCHELL:  Not -- not of which we're 

6 aware. So these are textual inferences that we're 

7 drawing --

8 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

9 MR. MITCHELL:  -- from constitutional 

10   structure, intratextualist analysis. 

11 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah. 

12 MR. MITCHELL:  But we aren't relying 

13 necessarily on the thought processes of the people 

14 who drafted these provisions because they're 

15   unknowable.  But, even if they were knowable, we're 

16 not sure they would be relevant in any event because 

17 this language, especially in Section 3, was enacted 

18 as a compromise. 

19 There were certainly radical Republicans 

20 who wanted to go much further.  If you look at some 

21 of the earlier drafts that were proposed, some people 

22 wanted to ban all insurrectionists from holding 

23   office regardless of whether they previously swore an 

24 oath. Some people wanted to go further and ban them 

25 even from voting.  And --

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. Thank 

2 you, counsel. 

3 I just have one very technical question. 

4 The statute in 1870, if -- if it were still in 

5 effect, would require you to modify your arguments 

6   slightly.  It was repealed, as you say, in 1948. 

7 Do -- I -- I tried to find it, but I 

8   couldn't.  Do you know why it was repealed? 

9 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I -- we don't know why. 

10 It looks like it was done as part of a reorganization 

11 of the U.S. Code, so it doesn't appear there was any 

12   policy motivation behind that decision.  I think a 

13 lot of things got repealed during this 1948 --

14   decisions that were made. 

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

16 Justice Thomas, anything further? 

17 Justice Alito? 

18 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any history of 

19   states using Section 3 as a way to bar federal 

20   officeholders? 

21 MR. MITCHELL:  Not that I'm aware, Justice 

22   Alito, because of Griffin's Case.  I mean, Griffin's 

23 Case has been the law -- I shouldn't say that it's 

24 been the law because it was just a circuit court 

25 decision, but that has been the settled understanding

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor? 

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I just want to pin 

5 down your principal argument on Section 3. You argue 

6 that even though the president may or may not 

7 qualify -- presidency may or may not qualify as an 

8   office under the United States, your principal 

9   argument is that the president is not an officer of 

10 the United States, correct? 

11 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah, I would say it a 

12 little more forcefully than what Your Honor just 

13   described.  We believe the presidency is excluded 

14 from "office under the United States," but the 

15 argument we have that he's excluded, the president, 

16 as an officer of the United States is the stronger of 

17 the two textually. 

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ah. 

19 MR. MITCHELL:  It has fewer implications 

20 for other constitutional provisions --

3 make it up. I know some scholars have been 

4 discussing it. But just so we're clear, under that 

5   reading, only -- only the Petitioner is disqualified 

6 because virtually every other president except

11 MR. MITCHELL:  That's right.  Every

13 -- John Adams might also be excluded because he took 

14 the oath as a vice president, which is not an officer 

15 -- but, yes, President Biden would certainly be 

16   covered.  He took the oath as a member of Congress. 

17 And that's true of every previous president. 

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would that be true if 

19 we were to hold more narrowly in a reversal that it's 

20 not Section 3 that's at issue but Thornton and others

11 about "office" versus "officer of the United States," 

12 I mean, it -- it -- it would suggest that we should 

13 ask what -- is that rule a sensible one?  You know, 

14 if they had thought about it, what reason would they 

15 have given for that rule? 

16 And it does seem as though there -- there's 

17 no particular reason, and you can think of lots of 

18 reasons for the contrary --

19 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. 

20 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to say that the only 

21 people who have engaged in insurrection who are not 

22   disqualified from office are presidents who have not

1   legislation.  And sometimes this happens with 

2   statutory compromises and even constitutional 

3   compromises.  There's an agreed-upon set of words 

4 that can pass both Houses of Congress, but different 

5   legislators may have had goals and motivations.  They 

6 didn't all get their way. In a compromise, everyone 

7 goes away miserable. 

8 But this was the text that was settled 

9 upon. And it does seem odd that President Trump 

10 would fall through the cracks in a sense, but if 

11 "officer of the United States" means appointed 

12   officials, there's just no way he can be covered 

13 under Section 3.  The Court would have to reject our 

14 officer argument to get to that point. 

15 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is there any better 

16 reason, if he -- go to the office argument that 

17 Justice Jackson was suggesting, is there any better 

18   reason for saying that an insurrectionist cannot hold 

19 the whole panoply of offices in the United States, 

20 but we're perfectly fine with that insurrectionist 

21 being president?

1   inferences that could be drawn from each of those 

2   provisions Your Honor just mentioned, but the 

3   Commissions Clause, I think, is the strongest because 

4 it says the president shall, you know, "commission 

5 all the Officers of the United States."  "Shall" is 

6   mandatory.  "All" is all-encompassing.  And the 

7   president doesn't commission himself, and he can't 

8   commission himself.  So that's one of the first 

9   problems. 

10 I think the Anderson litigants are trying 

11 to say, you know, there's somehow an implied 

12   exception there because the president obviously can't 

13   commission himself, so we should construe that to 

14 mean all officers of the United States besides the 

15   president.  But you also have members of Congress who 

16 are not commissioned by the president, and that's 

17 because they're not officers of the United States. 

18 So the only sensible distinction that we 

19 can see, given the language of the Commissions 

20 Clause, is that officers of -- of the United States 

21 are appointed officials, and elected officials, such 

22 as members of Congress and the president and the vice 

23   president, are not.

1 Officers of the United States shall be removed from 

2   Office [upon] Impeachment for, and Conviction of ... 

3 [all] high Crimes and Misdemeanors."  The president 

4 and the vice president are listed separately from 

5   officers of the United States. 

6 And then, of course, the Appointments 

7 Clause, we know the president is not appointed 

8   pursuant to Article II.  Neither is the vice 

9   president.  Neither are members of Congress.  So they 

10 can't be officers either. 

11 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And how does Article I, 

12 Section 6, fit into this discussion? 

13 MR. MITCHELL:  And this is about officers 

14 being in the line of succession? 

15 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yes, exactly. 

16 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  So you have to be an 

17 officer to be in the line of succession.  We have a 

18 federal statute that puts the Speaker and the 

19   President Pro Tempore in the line of succession. 

20 They are officers.  But they're not officers of the 

21   United States because they're not subject to 

22   impeachment, they're not commissioned by the 

23   president, and they're not appointed pursuant to 

24 Article II.

1   "officer" and the phrase "officers of the United 

2   States," reinforcing the idea that "officers of the 

3   United States" is a term of art that doesn't refer 

4 just to federal officeholders, which is what the 

5 Anderson litigants are claiming, but refers only to 

6 those who are appointed, not to those who are 

7   elected.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kavanaugh? 

10            JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Can I just make sure I 

11   understand how you're using Griffin's Case again? 

12 Section 3 refers to insurrection and raises questions 

13 about who decides what processes are to be used. 

14   That's ratified in 1868.  The next year, Chief 

15 Justice Chase opines that states do not have the 

16   authority, that only Congress has the authority to 

17 enforce that.  That could be evidence, as you say, of 

18 the original public meaning, at least some evidence. 

19 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. 

20 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's a precedent, 

21   although not binding.  But your point then is it's 

22   reinforced because Congress itself relies on that 

23 precedent in the Enforcement Act of 1870 and forms 

24 the backdrop against which Congress does legislate.

1 practice for 155 years has been that that's the way 

2 it's gone.  There hasn't -- there haven't been state 

3 attempts to enforce disqualification under Section 3 

4 against federal officers in the years since. 

5 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. 

6 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So whether that's a 

7   Federalist 37 liquidation argument, it all reinforces 

8 what happened back in 1868, 1869, and 1870. 

9 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. 

10 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you want to add to 

11 that, alter that? 

12 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I think that's exactly 

13 right. And the last part you mentioned, Your Honor, 

14 is crucial to our argument, that Congress relied on 

15   Griffin's Case.  It provided the backdrop against 

16 which they legislated, which is why we should read 

17 these extant enforcement mechanisms -- and, right 

18 now, the only one left is the federal insurrection 

19   statute, 2383 -- as exclusive of state court 

20   remedies.  It's an -- it's a form of implied 

21   preemption, almost Sea Clammers implicit preemption 

22 of other remedies, because Congress made these 

23 decisions in explicit reliance on Griffin's Case.

5 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  A new --

6 MR. MITCHELL:  -- rule out the possibility. 

7 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- a new statute in 

8   addition to 2383.  And just to be clear, under 2383, 

9 you agree that someone could be prosecuted for 

10 insurrection by federal prosecutors and, if 

11   convicted, could be or shall be disqualified then 

12 from office? 

13 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. But the only caveat 

14 that I would add is that our client is arguing that 

15 he has presidential immunity.  So we would not 

16 concede that he can be prosecuted for what he did on 

17 January 6th under 2383.

6 Griffin have raised at his trial or in direct appeal

8 you can't legitimately sit -- or constitutionally sit 

9 on my case because you're an insurrectionist and

11 MR. MITCHELL:  No. 

12 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why? 

13 MR. MITCHELL:  Not if -- not if Griffin's 

14 Case is correct. So a court would have to reject the 

15 rationale of Griffin's Case to accept what Your Honor 

16 was suggesting.

2   adjudicate his case? 

3 MR. MITCHELL:  What Griffin's Case holds is 

4 that only Congress can provide the means of enforcing 

5 Section 3. And under Your Honor's hypothetical, 

6   Congress has not enacted any such statute that would 

7 give Mr. Griffin the right to raise those types of 

8   arguments at his trial.  So he would have to await 

9   legislation from Congress. 

10 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Let's assume that 

11 I disagree with you about the officer argument, so 

12 Section 3 covers President Trump.  Let's say that 

13 Congress enacts a quo warranto provision that would 

14 allow a -- a state or I guess it doesn't really 

15 matter for this purpose, even -- even a federal 

16   prosecutor, to bring such an action against him to 

17 remove him from office --

19 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- in the quo warranto 

20 way. 

21 Wouldn't that be in some tension with

1 federal officeholders that were covered by Section 3 

2 as opposed to state ones? 

3 MR. MITCHELL:  I believe they could.  The 

4   Impeachment Clause says that "the President, [the] 

5 Vice President and all civil Officers of the United 

6 States, shall be removed from office [upon] 

7   Impeachment ... and Conviction."  But it doesn't say 

8 that's the only way you can remove them. 

9 I mean, Congress can defund a position and 

10   effectively, it's not the -- quite the same as formal 

11   removal, but the other relevant precedent is Stuart 

12 against Laird when the Jeffersonians repealed the 

13   Midnight Judges Act and abolished all of these 

14   positions for federal judges.  And some people 

15 thought that was unconstitutional because they 

16 thought the only way you could eliminate federal 

17 judges was through impeachment, but Chief Justice 

18   Marshall upheld that statute. 

19 So that to me is a relevant precedent 

20 showing that impeachment is not the only way to get 

21 rid of a federal official.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Jackson? 

8 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Going back to whether the 

9   presidency is one of the barred offices, I -- I guess 

10 I'm a little surprised at your response to Justice 

11 Kagan because I thought that the history of the 

12   Fourteenth Amendment actually provides the reason for 

13 why the presidency may not be included. 

14 And by that, I mean I didn't see any 

15 evidence that the presidency was top of mind for the 

16 Framers when they were drafting Section 3 because 

17 they were actually dealing with a different issue. 

18 The pressing concern, at least as I see the 

19   historical record, was actually what was going on at 

20 lower levels of the government, the possible 

21 infiltration and embedding of insurrectionists into 

22 the state government apparatus and the real risk that 

23   former Confederates might return to power in the 

24 South via state-level elections either in local 

25 offices or as representatives of the states in

2 Your concern is trying to make sure that

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON C. MURRAY 

7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ANDERSON, ET AL. 

8 MR. MURRAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9   please the Court: 

10 We are here because, for the first time 

11 since the War of 1812, our nation's Capitol came 

12    under violent assault.  For the first time in 

13 history, the attack was incited by a sitting 

14 president of the United States to disrupt the 

15   peaceful transfer of presidential power. 

16 By engaging in insurrection against the 

17   Constitution, President Trump disqualified himself 

18 from public office.  As we heard earlier, President 

19 Trump's main argument is that this Court should 

20 create a special exemption to Section 3 that would 

21 apply to him and to him alone. He says Section 3 

22   disqualifies all oath-breaking insurrectionists, 

23   except a former president who never before held other 

24 state or federal office. 

25 There is no possible rationale for such an

1   exemption, and the Court should reject the -- the --

2 the claim that the Framers made an extraordinary 

3   mistake.  Section 3 uses deliberately broad language 

4 to cover all positions of federal power requiring an 

5 oath to the Constitution. 

6 My friend relies on a claimed difference 

7 between "an office under" and "an officer of the 

8   United States," but this case does not come down to 

9 mere prepositions.  The two phrases are two sides of 

10 the same coin, referring to any federal office or to 

11   anyone who holds one. 

12 President Trump's other arguments for 

13 reversal ignore the constitutional role of the states 

14 in running presidential elections.  Under Article II 

15 and the Tenth Amendment, states have the power to 

16 ensure that their citizens' electoral votes are not 

17 wasted on a candidate who is constitutionally barred 

18 from holding office. 

19 States are allowed to safeguard their 

20 ballots by excluding those who are under age, 

21   foreign-born, running for a third presidential term, 

22 or, as here, those who have engaged in insurrection 

23 against the Constitution, in violation of their oath.

2 mean shortly after the adoption of the Fourteenth 

3   Amendment -- where the states disqualified national 

4 candidates, not its own candidates, but national 

5   candidates? 

6 MR. MURRAY: The only example I can think 

7 of, Justice Thomas, is the example of governor -- of 

8 -- of Congressman Christy, who was elected in Georgia 

9 in I believe 1868, and the governor of Georgia 

10 refused -- or -- or -- declined to certify the 

11 results of that election because Mr. Christy was 

12   disqualified. 

13 But I think it's -- it's not surprising 

14 that there are few examples because we didn't have 

15 ballots in the same way back then.  Candidates were. 

16 Either write-in or -- or they were party 

17   ballots, so the states didn't run the ballots in the 

18 same way, and there wouldn't have been a process for 

19 determining before an election whether a candidate 

20 was qualified, unlike the processes that we have now 

21 that states have created under their Article I and 

22 Article II powers to run elections.

1 that you would have that kind of conflict.  There 

2 were a plethora of Confederates still around.  There 

3 were any number of people who would continue to 

4   either run for state offices or national offices. 

5 So it would seem -- it -- that would 

6 suggest that there would at least be a few examples 

7 of national candidates being disqualified if your 

8 reading is correct. 

9 MR. MURRAY: Well, there were certainly 

10   national candidates who were disqualified by Congress 

11   refusing to seat them. 

12 JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, I understand that, but 

13 that's not this case. I'm talking -- did states 

14   disqualify them?  That's what we're talking about 

15 here. I understand Congress would not seat them. 

16 MR. MURRAY: Other than the example I gave, 

17 no, but, again, Your Honor, that -- that's not 

18   surprising because there wouldn't have been -- states 

19 certainly wouldn't have the authority to remove a 

20 sitting federal officer. 

21 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what's the purpose of 

22 the -- what was the purpose of the -- of Section 3? 

23 The states were sending people -- the -- the concern 

24 was that the former Confederate states would continue 

25 being bad actors, and the effort was to prevent them

1 from doing this. 

2 And you're saying that, well, this also 

3   authorized states to disqualify candidates.  So what 

4 I'm asking you for, if you are right, what are the 

5   examples? 

6 MR. MURRAY: Well, Your Honor, the examples 

7 are states excluded many candidates for state office, 

8   individuals holding state offices.  We have a number 

9 of published cases of states concerning that. 

10 JUSTICE THOMAS: I understand that.  I -- I 

11   understand the states controlling state elections and 

12 state positions.  What we are talking about here are 

13   national candidates. 

14 The -- I understand.  You look at Foner or 

15   Foote, Shelby Foote, or McPherson, they all talk 

16 about, of course, the conflict after the Civil War, 

17 and there were people who felt very strongly about 

18 retaliating against the South, the radical 

19 Republicans, but they did not think about authorizing 

20 the South to disqualify national candidates. 

21 And that's the argument you're making, and 

22 what I would like to know is you give -- is do you 

23 have any examples of this?

25 filed briefs in our support in this case, making the

1 point that the -- the -- the idea of the Fourteenth 

2   Amendment was that both states and the federal 

3 government would ensure rights and that if states 

4 failed to do so, the federal government certainly 

5 would also step in. 

6 But I think the reason why there aren't 

7 examples of states doing this is an idiosyncratic one 

8 of the fact that elections worked differently back 

9 then. States have a background power under Article 

10 II and the Tenth Amendment to run presidential 

11   elections.  They didn't use that power to police 

12   ballot access until about the 1890s.  And by the 

13   1890s, everyone had received amnesty and these issues 

14 had become moot.  So I don't think the history tells 

15 us --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'd like 

17 to sort of look at Justice Thomas's question sort of 

18 from the 30,000-foot level. I mean, the whole point 

19 of the Fourteenth Amendment was to restrict state 

20   power, right?  States shall not abridge privilege of 

21   immunity, they won't deprive people of property 

22 without due process, they won't deny equal 

23   protection.  And on the other hand, it augmented 

24 federal power under Section 5.  Congress has the 

25 power to enforce it.

1 So wouldn't that be the last place that 

2 you'd look for authorization for the states, 

3   including Confederate states, to enforce --

4   implicitly authorize to enforce the presidential 

5   election process?  That -- that seems to be a 

6   position that is at -- at war with the whole thrust 

7 of the Fourteenth Amendment and very ahistorical. 

8 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor.  First, we 

9 would locate the states' authority to run 

10 presidential elections not in the Fourteenth 

11   Amendment but in Article II.  And that power is 

12   nearly plenary to determine the means --

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but you're 

14 relying on -- you have no reliance on Section 3, is 

15 that what you're saying? 

16 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor.  Certainly, we 

17 have reliance on Section 3 insofar as Article II 

18 gives states this broad power to determine how their 

19   electors are selected, and that broad power implies 

20 the narrower power to enforce federal constitutional 

21   qualifications like Section 3. 

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

23 narrower power you're looking for is the power of 

24   disqualification, right?  That is a very specific 

25 power in the Fourteenth Amendment.  And you're saying

1 that was implicitly extended to the states under a 

2 clause that doesn't address that at all? 

3 MR. MURRAY: We would say that nothing in 

4 the Fourteenth Amendment takes away from the states 

5 their broad and nearly plenary power to determine the 

6 manner of selecting their electors in the manner that 

7 they see fit. As this Court said in Chiafalo, that 

8 power is nearly plenary unless something in the 

9 Constitution tells states they can't do it. 

10 And -- and the structure of the Fourteenth 

11 Amendment certainly was intended to expand federal 

12 power and certainly to restrict state power in some 

13 ways, but states are bound to enforce and apply, for 

14   example, Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  And 

15 so it -- it's hard to see why states wouldn't be 

16 similarly bound or at least authorized --

17 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But that's -- that's a 

18 --

19 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, just --

20 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- "greater includes 

21 the lesser" argument.  The -- the states have the 

22   power, the legislature has the power to choose 

23   electors.  Granted.  But just because there's one 

24   authorized means in the Constitution to a particular 

25 end does not mean that there's any means to that end.

1            And so I think you're taking that electors 

2   argument and bringing it into Section 3, where, as 

3 the Chief Justice says, there's just no -- and 

4 Justice Thomas, there's no historical evidence to 

5 support kind of the theory of Section 3, nor the 

6 overall -- to explain the overall structure of -- of 

7 the Fourteenth Amendment. 

8 MR. MURRAY: We certainly have a long 

9 history in this country of states using their power 

10 to determine the manner of selecting presidential 

11 electors to enforce other qualifications in the 

12   Constitution.  I don't -- I don't take it there's a 

13 great debate about whether or not states are allowed 

14 to exclude underaged or foreign-born candidates or, 

15 if President Bush or Obama wanted to run for a third 

16 term, that they could be excluded under that broad 

17 Article II power. 

18 I don't see why Section 3 should be treated 

19 any differently.  Section 3 speaks in the same 

20   mandatory terms. 

21 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, when you look at 

22 -- at Section 3, the term "insurrection" jumps out,

25 decides whether someone engaged in it? What

1   processes -- as Justice Barrett alluded to, what 

2 processes are appropriate for figuring out whether 

3 someone did engage in that? 

4 And that's all what Chief Justice Chase 

5 focused on a year after the Fourteenth Amendment to 

6 say these are difficult questions and you look right 

7 at Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as the 

8 Chief Justice said, and that tells you Congress has 

9 the primary role here. 

10 I think what's different is -- is the 

11   processes, the definition, who decides questions 

12 really jump out at you when you look at Section 3. 

13 MR. MURRAY: Cert --

14 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Your response to that? 

15 MR. MURRAY: Well, certainly, Justice 

16   Kavanaugh, there has to be some process for 

17   determining those questions, and then the question 

18 becomes, does anything in the Fourteenth Amendment 

19 say that only Congress can create that process?  And 

20 -- and Section 5 very clearly is not an exclusive 

21   provision.  It says Congress shall have power.  And 

22 --

8 Why does -- you know, if you weren't from

9 see fit.  But, if they're going to use a federal 

10   constitutional qualification as a ballot access 

11   determinant, then it's creating a federal 

12   constitutional question that then this Court decides 

13 and other courts, other states -- if -- if this Court 

14 affirms the decision below, determining that 

15 President Trump is ineligible to be president, other

17 would have on their own state's law and state

24 keep him on the ballot anyway, but, I mean, really,

2 push back a little bit on, well, it's a national 

3 thing because this Court will decide it. 

4 You say that we have to review Colorado's 

5 factual record with clear error as the standard of 

6 review. So we would be stuck.  The first mover

11 what if it wasn't a fulsome record?  What if, you 

12 know, the -- the hearsay rules are, you know, 

13   one-offs? Or what if this is just made by the 

14 secretary of state without much process at all? 

15 How do we review those factual findings? 

16 Why should clear error review apply?  And doesn't 

17 that just kind of buckle back into this point that

2 something more like a Bose Corp. style independent 

3 review of the factual record. 

4 And we would have no objection to that 

5 given that the record here -- really -- really, the 

6 facts that are disputed here are incredibly narrow. 

7 The essence of our case is President Trump's own 

8 statements that he made in public view for all to 

9 see. 

10 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But then that's saying 

11 that in this context, which is very high stakes, if 

12 we review the facts essentially de novo, you want us 

13 all to just watch the video of the Ellipse and then 

14 make a decision without any deference to or guidance 

15 from lower court fact finding?  That's unusual. 

16 MR. MURRAY: Well, ultimately, President 

17 Trump himself urges this Court to decide the merits 

18 of his eligibility on the factual record here at page 

19 2 of his brief. He's never at any point in this 

20   proceeding suggested there was something else that 

21 needed to be in the factual record, any other 

22   witnesses that he wanted to call to present his case. 

23 And, again, the essence of our case is his 

24 own statements and -- and -- and, in particular, his 

25 own videotaped statements on the Ellipse --

5 Do you agree that the state's powers here 

6 over its ballot for federal officer election have to 

7 come from some constitutional authority? 

8 MR. MURRAY: Members of this Court have 

9   disagreed about that. 

10 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm asking you. 

11 (Laughter.) 

12 MR. MURRAY: The -- the majority of this 

13 Court has said that those powers come from Article 

14 II. But we think that the result is the same whether 

15 the Court locates it in Article II or in a reserved 

16 power under the Tenth Amendment. 

17 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  But -- but you 

18 accept that this Court has held, you're not 

19   contesting this or asking us to revisit that decision 

20 in Thornton or Term Limits or whatever you want to 

21 call it that it has to come from some federal

14 MR. MURRAY: We're suggesting that in their 

15 broad power to determine the -- to select 

16   presidential electors in any manner they see fit, 

17 they can take account of Section 3 and apply Section 

18 3 --

19 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Could they do it without 

20 Section 3? Could they disqualify somebody for -- you 

21 -- you know, on whatever basis they wanted outside of

1 right? So it has to come back to Section 3.  And if 

2   that's true, how does that work given that Section 3 

3   speaks about holding office, not who may run for 

4 office. It was a point Mr. Mitchell was making 

5 earlier and I just wanted to give you a chance to 

6 respond to it because it seems to me that -- that, 

7 you know, that -- that you're asking to enforce in an 

8   election -- context a provision of the Constitution 

9 that speaks to holding office.  So it's different 

10 than the Qualifications Clause, which is all about 

11 who can run and then serve, yeah. 

12            MR. MURRAY: I -- I don't know that it is 

13   different. 

14 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. 

15 MR. MURRAY: Other qualifications for 

16   office similarly talk about eligibility for the 

17 office. There's nothing unconstitutional about a 

18   30-year-old trying to get on the ballot.

4 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So were his actions after 

5 that date, before he left office, ultra vires?  Is 

6 that -- is that the -- where your theory leads? 

7 MR. MURRAY: Well, that would raise the 

8   separate question of whether one can collaterally 

9   attack the actions of a de facto officer.  And that 

10 may be the one place in Griffin's Case at the very 

11 end where we would agree, which is -- which is when 

12 Justice Chase said, I've talked to my Supreme Court 

13   colleagues and we unanimously agree that you can't 

14 collaterally attack all official actions of an 

15 officer who's holding -- who's, in fact, holding the 

16   position under Section --

17 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  But -- but 

18 just circle back to where we started, right?  That 

19 this is Section 3. Your authority has to come from 

20 there. And it's about holding office and it's a 

21   particular kind of disability that can be removed by 

22   Congress and it's the only one like that, right?

1 office? 

2 MR. MURRAY: The colloquy that my friend 

3 had with Justice Alito earlier, I think, is 

4   illustrative here.  The fact that Congress has an 

5 extraordinary removal power does not negate that the 

6   disability exists today and exists indefinitely into 

7 the future, much like the fact that Congress -- that 

8 the president can pardon somebody for a criminal 

9   conviction doesn't make that conviction somehow --

10 somehow contingent. 

11 And -- and I would note that if President 

12 Trump were appointed to an office today, if he were 

13   appointed as a state judge, he could not hold that 

14 office, which shows that the disability exists now. 

15 And -- and the fact that Congress has a 

16 power to remove the disability doesn't negate the 

17 present qualification, nor does it implicitly bestow 

18 on President Trump a constitutional right to run for 

19 offices that he cannot hold in violation of state law 

20 and state procedure under Article II. 

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In fact, there was a --

22 a congressional action to permit Confederate officers

1 ballot, and others for the Republican candidate,

3 handful of states that are going to decide the 

4   presidential election.  That's a pretty daunting

6 MR. MURRAY: Well, certainly, Your Honor, 

7 the fact that there are potential frivolous 

8   applications of a constitutional provision isn't a 

9 reason that would --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, hold on. 

11 I mean, you might think they're frivolous, but the 

12   people who are bringing them may not think they're 

13   frivolous.  Insurrection is a broad, broad term, and 

14 if there's some debate about it, I suppose that will 

15 go into the decision and then, eventually, what, we 

16 would be deciding whether it was an insurrection when 

17 one president did something as opposed to when 

18 somebody else did something else? And what do we do? 

19 Do we wait until near the time of counting the 

20 ballots and sort of go through which states are valid 

21 and which states aren't? 

22 MR. MURRAY: There's a reason Section 3 has 

23 been dormant for 150 years, and it's because we 

24 haven't seen anything like January 6th since 

25   Reconstruction.

2   something extraordinary.  And --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me 

4 you're avoiding the question, which is other states 

5 may have different views about what constitutes 

6   insurrection. 

7 And now you're saying, well, it's all right 

8 because somebody, presumably us, are going to decide, 

9 well, they said they thought that was an 

10   insurrection, but they were wrong.  And maybe they 

11 thought it was right. And we'd have to develop rules 

12 for what constitutes an insurrection. 

13 MR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor.  Just like 

14 this Court interprets other constitutional 

15   provisions, this Court can make clear that an 

16   insurrection against the Constitution is something 

17   extraordinary. 

18 And, in particular, it really requires a 

19 concerted group effort to resist through violence not 

20 some ordinary application of state or federal law but 

21 the functions mandated by the Constitution itself. 

22 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On -- on your point 

23 that it's been dormant for 155 years, I think the 

24 other side would say the reason for that is Chief 

25 Justice Chase's opinion in 1869 in Griffin's Case to

1   start, which says that Congress has the authority 

2 here, not the states.  That's followed up by the 

3 Enforcement Act of 1870, in which Congress acts upon 

4 that understanding, which is followed -- and there's 

5 no history contrary in that period, as Justice Thomas 

6 pointed out, there's no history contrary in all the 

7 years leading up to this of states exercising such 

8   authority. 

9 I think the reason it's been dormant is 

10 because there's been a settled understanding that 

11 Chief Justice Chase, even if not right in every 

12 detail, was essentially right, and the branches of 

13 the government have acted under that settled 

14   understanding for 155 years. 

15 And Congress can change that. And Congress 

16 does have Section 2383, of course, the Insurrection 

17 Act, a criminal statute.  But Congress could change 

18 it, but they have not in the 155 years in relevant 

19   respects for what you want here today at least. 

20 MR. MURRAY: No, Justice Kavanaugh.  The 

21 reason why it's been dormant is because, by 1876, 

22 essentially, all former Confederates had received 

23   amnesty.  And we haven't seen anything like an 

24   insurrection since then.

6   question about whether the power that you've 

7   described as plenary really is plenary. 

8 Suppose that the outcome of an election for 

9 president comes down to the vote of a single state, 

10 how the electors of the vote of a single state are 

11 going to vote. And suppose that Candidate A gets a 

12 majority of the votes in that state, but the 

13   legislature really doesn't like Candidate A, thinks 

14   Candidate A is an insurrectionist, so the legislature 

15 then passes a law ordering its electors to vote for 

16 the other candidate. 

17 Do you think the state has that power?

19   principles that -- that come into play in terms of

9 what we have here, which is simple application of

13 MR. MURRAY: Well, ultimately, there still 

14 has to be some kind of procedure in place to 

15   adjudicate the disqualification.  Certainly, Congress

1 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Please don't change the 

2   hypothetical.  I know.  I like doing it too, but 

3   please don't do it, okay? 

4 MR. MURRAY: Well, the -- the point I'm 

5 trying to make is that --

6 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  He's disqualified from 

7 the moment he committed an insurrection, whoever it 

8 is, which -- whichever party.  It -- that -- that 

9   happens.  Boom.  It happened. 

10 What would compel -- and I'm not going to 

11 say it again, so just try and answer the question. 

12 If you don't have an answer, fair enough, we'll move 

13 on. What would compel a lower official to obey an 

14 order from that individual? 

15 MR. MURRAY: Because, ultimately, we have 

16 -- we have statutes and rules requiring chains of 

17   command.  The person is in the office, and even if 

18 they don't have the authority to hold the office, the 

19 only way to get someone out of the office of the 

20   presidency is impeachment, and so I think, if you 

21 interpreted Section 3 in light of other provisions in 

22 the Constitution like impeachment, while they hold 

23 office, impeachment's the only way to validate that 

24 they don't have the ability to hold that office and 

25 should be removed.

1 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Murray, can I -- oh. 

2 Can I just ask you about something -- Justice Kagan 

3 brought up earlier, which is the concern about 

4   uniformity and the lack thereof if states are 

5   permitted to enforce Section 3 in presidential 

6   elections, and I -- I guess I didn't really 

7   understand your argument or your response to her 

8 about that. 

9 MR. MURRAY: Well, certainly, if Congress 

10 is concerned about uniformity, they can provide for 

11   legislation and they can preempt state legislation. 

12 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes --

13 MR. MURRAY: But --

14 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- but you say that's not 

15   necessary. 

16 MR. MURRAY: But it's not necessary in the 

17 absence of federal enforcement legislation.  These 

18   questions come up to this Court in the same way that 

19 other federal questions come up to this Court, which 

20 is that a state adjudicates them. If the state 

21   hasn't provided sufficient process to comport with 

22 due process and notice and opportunity to be heard, 

23 one can make those challenges.  But assuming, as 

24 here, we have a full evidentiary record, an 

25   opportunity to present evidence --

1 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand -- I 

2 understand that we could resolve it so that we have a 

3 uniform ultimate ruling on it. 

4 I guess my question is why the Framers 

5 would have designed a system that would -- could 

6 result in interim disuniformity in this way, where we 

7 have elections pending and different states suddenly 

8   saying you're eligible, you're not, on the basis of 

9 this kind of thing? 

10 MR. MURRAY: Well, what they were concerned 

11 most about was ensuring that insurrectionists and 

12   rebels don't hold office. And so, once one 

13   understands the sort of imperative that they had to 

14 ensure that oath-breakers wouldn't take office, it 

15 would be a little bit odd to say that states can't 

16 enforce it, that only the federal government can 

17 enforce it, and that Congress can essentially rip the 

18 heart out of Section 3 by a simple majority just by 

19 failing to pass enforcement legislation. 

20 Federalism creates redundancy.  And, here, 

21 the fact that states have the ability to enforce it 

22 as well, absent federal preemption, provides an 

23   additional layer of safeguards around what really 

24 Section 3 --

19 has never interpreted the aid and comfort language, 

20 which also is present in the Treason Clause, but 

21   commentators have suggested -- it's been rarely

2 two countries. 

3 And -- and, second, the intent standard 

4 would do a lot of work there because, under Section 

5 3, whatever the underlying conduct is, engaging in 

6 insurrection or aid and comfort, has to be done with 

7 the intent to further the unlawful purpose of the 

8   insurrection or -- or to aid the enemies in their 

9 pursuit of war against the United States. 

10 JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, let me come back to 

11 the question of what we would do if we were -- if 

12   different states had adjudicated the question of 

13 whether former President Trump is an insurrectionist 

14 using a different record, different rulings on the 

15   admissibility of evidence, perhaps different

17 MR. MURRAY: Ultimately, this Court would 

18 -- first of all, if there were deficiencies in the 

19 record, the Court could either refuse to hear the 

20 case or it could decide on the basis of deficiencies 

21 of the record.

2 by state court judges, some of whom may be elected? 

3 Would we have to have our own trial?

6 And, here, we have an evidentiary record that all the 

7 parties agree is sufficient for a decision in -- in 

8 this case. 

9 And then, as -- as I discussed earlier, 

10 there's a possibility of a Bose Corp. independent 

11 review of the facts, but, ultimately, what we have 

12 here is an insurrection that was incited in plain 

13 sight for all to see.

9 insofar as both sides had the opportunity to present 

10 their case and -- and the essential facts in the 

11 record that everyone agreed was sufficient for a

14   decide which -- which holding was correct and then 

15 decide that issue for the country. 

16 And, certainly, here, when -- when there is 

17 a complete record, lower courts then will be applying

9 MR. MURRAY: Not -- not at all, Your Honor. 

10 Two points on that.  Number one, President Trump 

11 didn't appeal the admission of that evidence in this 

12 case, but -- but, number two, you know, the second 

13 point is that Professor Simi really -- he didn't 

14 opine on the meaning of President Trump's words. 

15 He opined on the effect that those words 

16 had on violent extremists, and the essence of his 

17   testimony was built around videotaped statements of 

18 President Trump himself encouraging, inciting, and 

19   praising political violence when --

20 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I'm not taking a

1 what some people have seen as the consequences of the 

2   argument that you're advancing, which is that there 

3 will be conflicts in decisions among the states, that 

4   different states will disqualify different 

5   candidates, but I -- I'm not getting a whole lot of 

6 help from you about how this would not be an 

7   unmanageable situation. 

8 MR. MURRAY: If this Court writes an 

9 opinion affirming on the basis of the indisputable 

10 facts of what President Trump said on January 6th and 

11 in the weeks leading up to it and his virtual 

12   confession on Twitter after the fact, then it would 

13 be reversible error for any other state to conclude 

14 otherwise on that question of federal law, or -- or, 

15 at the very least, this Court could address that when 

16 those issues come up, but it seems unlikely. 

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor? 

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's two sides to --

19 to the other side's position.  The first is that it's 

20 not self-executing. I want to put that aside. 

21 Deal with if we were to hold that states 

22 don't have the right to enforce or create a cause of 

23 action in this situation.  They want the flip to say 

24 that nobody -- even Congress can't do it because they 

25 need implementing legislation.  Address that

2 MR. MURRAY: That -- that --

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because assume we rule 

4 that states don't have it. What would you have us 

5 say for the other side of the argument? One of my 

6   colleagues says you need or what -- what not -- not 

7 then Chief Justice but Circuit Court Justice Chase 

8 said, which is that somehow you need implementing 

9   legislation, like the 1870 Act. 

10 You seem to say that's not true because 

11 they could decide not to seat the -- seat a 

12   candidate, et cetera.  So I don't know that 

13   legislation's necessary. 

14 MR. MURRAY: And, certainly, there are 

15 historical examples of member -- members of Congress 

16 under their Article -- under Congress's Article I 

17 power to judge the qualifications of its members, of 

18 members of Congress refusing to seat ineligible 

19   candidates under Section 3 who have won election. 

20 In the context of the presidency, I think 

21 it would create a number of really difficult issues 

22 if the Court says there's no procedure for 

23   determining President Trump's eligibility until after 

24 the election. 

25 And then what happens when members of

1 Congress on January 6th, when they count the 

2 electoral votes, say we're not going to count 

3   electoral votes cast for President Trump because he's 

4   disqualified under Section 3 under the Electoral 

5 Count Reform Act. 

6 A number of the amicus briefs, such as 

7 those of Professor Ginsberg, Hasen, and Foley, have 

8 made the point that that is kind of a 

9   disenfranchisement and constitutional crisis in the 

10 making and is all the more reason to address those 

11 issues now in a judicial process on a full 

12 evidentiary record so that everybody can have 

13 certainty on those issues before they go to the 

14 polls. 

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? 

16 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Murray, you talked --

17 you relied on the states' extensive powers under the 

18   Electors Clause.  You talked about the states having 

19 a role in enacting, you know, typical ballot access 

20   provisions. 

21 I -- I guess -- I guess, you know, it 

22 strikes me that we've put some limits on that, and 

23 I'll just give you Anderson versus Celebrezze as an 

24 example of that, where we said, in fact, states are 

25 limited in who they can take off a ballot, and that

1 was a case about minor party candidates, but the 

2 reason was that one state's decision to take a 

3   candidate off the ballot affects everybody else's 

4 rights. 

5 And we talked about the pervasive national 

6 interest in the selection of candidates for national 

7 office. We talked about how an individual state's 

8 decision would have an impact beyond its own borders. 

9 So, if that goes for minor political party 

10 candidates, why doesn't it go a fortiori for the 

11   situation in this case? 

12 MR. MURRAY: Well, certainly, 

13   constitutional principles like Section 3 apply to 

14   everybody, but in -- in Celebrezze, the issue there 

15 was a First Amendment question, and, certainly, 

16 there's no doubt that states' exercise of their power 

17 under Article II is constrained by First Amendment 

18   principles. 

19 And -- and in -- in that case, the -- the 

20 state law deadlines for when a minor party candidate 

21 got on the ballot just came too soon to be reactive 

22 to what major parties had done and, therefore, risked 

23 disenfranchising people who were disillusioned with 

24 who the major parties had picked, and it raised First 

25   Amendment problems.  Here, there's no real First

1   Amendment problem and -- and a state is just trying 

2 to enforce an existing qualification that's baked 

3 into our constitutional fabric. 

4 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, I -- I -- I guess, 

5 you know, it -- it did come up in the First 

6   Amendment, but there's a broader principle there and 

7 it's a broader principle about who has power over 

8 certain things in our federal system, and, you know, 

9   within our federal system, states have great power 

10 over many different areas.  But that there's some 

11 broader principle about that there are certain 

12 national questions that -- that -- that -- that, you 

13 -- you know, state -- where states are not the 

14   repository of authority.  And I took a lot -- First 

15   Amendment, not First Amendment -- a lot of Anderson's 

16   reasoning is really about that.  Like, what's a state 

17 doing deciding who gets to -- who other citizens get 

18 to vote for for president? 

19 MR. MURRAY: Colorado is not deciding who 

20 other states get to vote for for president.  It's 

21 deciding how to assign its own electors under its 

22 Article II power. And the Constitution grants them 

23 that broad power as --

24 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but the effect of 

25 that is obvious, yes?

1 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor, because 

2   different states can have different procedures.  Some 

3   states may allow insurrectionists to be on the 

4 ballot. They may say we're not looking past the 

5 papers; we're not going to look into federal 

6   constitutional questions.  It's the sort of -- I --

7 even in this election cycle, there are -- there are 

8 candidates who are on the ballot in some states even 

9   though they're not natural-born citizens and off the 

10 ballot in other states.  And that's just a function 

11 of states' power to enforce -- to preserve their own

1 "office" and "officer" in the earlier discussion, you 

2 may recall, but I -- I think one point your -- your 

3 friends on the other side would make is, well, that's 

4 just how the Constitution uses those terms.  So, for 

5 example, we know that the President Pro Tem of the 

6   Senate and the Speaker of the House are officers of 

7 the United States because the Constitution says they 

8 are, but we also know that they don't hold an office 

9 under the United States because of the 

10 Incompatibility Clause that says they can't. 

11 So maybe the Constitution to us today, to a 

12 -- a lay reader, might look a little odd in 

13   distinguishing between "office" and "officer," not 

14   prepositions, nouns, a distinction, but maybe that's 

15 exactly how it works. Thoughts? 

16 MR. MURRAY: Well, I'd start with the idea 

17 that the -- the meaning of "officer" in the 1780s was 

18 the same meaning that it has today, which is a person 

19 who holds an office.  And -- and, certainly, in 

20   particular contexts like the Commissions Clause, it 

21 -- it appears that that's referring -- you know, that 

22 that is referring to a narrower class of officers 

23 because we know that there are --

24 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Except it says "all." 

25 MR. MURRAY: Well, we know that there are

1 classes of officers, like the President Pro Tem, who 

2 -- who don't get their commissions from the 

3   president. 

4 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that's because the 

5   Constitution elsewhere says that. 

6 MR. MURRAY: We know that the Appointments 

7 Clause refers to a class of officers who get their 

8   appointment from the Constitution itself --

9 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mm-hmm. 

10 MR. MURRAY: -- rather than from 

11   presidential appointment.  People who get their 

12   commissions from the president himself are not 

13   commissioned by the president.  And so, if you read 

14 the Appointments Clause in line with the Commissions 

15 Clause, then the Commissions Clause is really talking 

16 about the president's power.  If one needs a 

17   commission, it's the president who grants it. 

18 But I think it's important to bring us back 

19 to Section 3 in particular because that was 80 years 

20 --

21 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, before -- before we 

22 get to that, though, just the distinction between 

23   "office" and "officer," do you -- do you agree that 

24 the Constitution does make that distinction,

5 an oath and holds an office.  Now the President Pro 

6 Tem and the Speaker of the House, they don't swear a 

7   constitutional oath in that capacity.  They swear a 

8   constitutional oath if they are a senator or 

9   representative in Congress in that separate 

10   non-official capacity. But I think that narrow --

11 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You agree they are 

12 officers who don't hold an office? 

13 MR. MURRAY: They're officers who -- who 

14 may hold an office but don't swear an oath under 

15 Article VI in that official capacity. 

16 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, how can they hold 

17 an office?  Under the Incompatibility Clause, it says 

18 they can't. 

19 MR. MURRAY: Well, I -- I think that's a 

20 fair point, and I think that that may be an exception 

21 to the general rule, and one might consider them 

22 perhaps officers of the House and Senate because they 

23 are appointed by those bodies and preside over those 

24 bodies.

13 a national office, other questions about the 

14 different states having different standards of proof, 

15 and they seem underscored by this case, at least the 

16   dissenting opinion below.  Justice Samour said, 

17 "[I've] been involved" -- "[I've] been involved in 

18 the justice system for 33 years now, and what took 

19 place here doesn't resemble anything I've seen in a 

20   courtroom" and then added, "What transpired in this 

21   litigation fell woefully short of what due process 

22   demands."

1   bottom-line conclusion but about the very processes 

2 that were used in the state would seem to -- and that 

3 that would be permitted seems to underscore the 

4 concerns that have been raised about state power. 

5 Just wanted to give you a chance to address that 

6 because that was powerful language.  Again, not 

7 disagreeing about the conclusion but about the very 

8   fairness of the process. 

9 MR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor, but that 

10   language was, with respect to Justice Samour, just 

11 not correct.  President Trump had a five-day trial in 

12 this case.  He had the opportunity to call any 

13   witnesses that he wanted.  He had the opportunity to 

14   cross-examine our witnesses. He had the opportunity 

15 to testify if he wanted to testify.  And, of course, 

16 the process was expedited because ballot access 

17   decisions are always on a fast schedule. 

18 But, in this whole case, from the trial 

19 court all the way up to this Court, President Trump 

20 has never identified a single process, other than 

21   expert depositions, that he wanted to have that he 

22 didn't get. He had the opportunity for fact witness 

23   depositions.  He had the opportunity to call 

24   witnesses remotely.  He didn't use all of his time at 

25 trial. There was ample process here, and this is how

1   ballot access determinations in election cases are 

2 decided all the time. 

3 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  Second question, 

4 some of the rhetoric of your position -- I don't 

5 think it is your position, but some of the rhetoric 

6 of your position seems to suggest, unless the states 

7 can do this, no one can prevent insurrectionists from 

8 holding federal office.  But, obviously, Congress has 

9 enacted statutes, including one still in effect. 

10 Section 2383 of Title 18 prohibits insurrection. 

11 It's a federal criminal statute.  And if you're 

12   convicted of that, you are -- it says, "shall be 

13 disqualified" from holding any office. 

14 And so there is a federal statute on the 

15   books, but President Trump has not been charged with 

16 that. So what -- what are we to make of that? 

17 MR. MURRAY: Two things, Your Honor. 

18 Section 2383 was initially enacted about six years 

19   before Section 3.  It wasn't meant as implementing 

20   legislation related to Section 3.  And I would 

21   emphasize that by the time that Section 3 was 

22   ratified, most Confederates had already received 

23   criminal pardons.

1 MR. MURRAY: So --

2            JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- a little bit 

3   different, which is, if the concern you have, which I 

4   understand, is that insurrectionists should not be 

5 able to hold federal office, there is a tool to 

6 ensure that that does not happen, namely, federal 

7   prosecution of insurrectionists.  And I -- and if 

8   convicted, Congress made clear you are automatically 

9 barred from holding a federal office.  That tool 

10 exists, you agree, and could be used but has not --

11 could be used against someone who committed 

12   insurrection.  You agree with that? 

13 MR. MURRAY: That's absolutely right, Your 

14 Honor. But I would just make the point that the 

15 Framers of Section 3 clearly understood that criminal 

16   prosecutions weren't sufficient because oftentimes 

17 insurrectionists go unpunished, as was the case in 

18 the Civil War, and that the least we can do is impose 

19 a civil disqualification penalty so that even if we 

20 don't have the stomach to throw someone in jail --

21 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, they had the quo 

22 warranto provision that was in effect then from 18 --

23 1870 until 1948, but then, obviously, that dropped 

24 out and hasn't been seen as necessary since then.

1 what Section 3 means and kind of to the extent it's 

2 elusive language or vague language, what about the 

3 idea that we should think about democracy, think 

4 about the right of the people to elect candidates of 

5 their choice, of letting the people decide?  Because 

6 your position has the effect of disenfranchising 

7 voters to a significant degree. 

8 And should that be something -- does that 

9 come in when we think about should we read Section 3 

10 this way or read it that way?  What about the 

11   background principle, if you agree, of democracy? 

12 MR. MURRAY: I'd like to make three points 

13 on that, Justice Kavanaugh.  The first is that 

14   constitutional safeguards are for the purpose of 

15   safeguarding our democracy not just for the next 

16   election cycle but for generations to come. 

17 And -- and, second, Section 3 is designed 

18 to protect our democracy in that very way. The 

19 Framers of Section 3 knew from painful experience 

20 that those who had violently broken their oaths to 

21 the Constitution couldn't be trusted to hold power 

22 again because they could dismantle our constitutional 

23 democracy from within, and so they created a 

24   democratic safety valve.  President Trump can go ask 

25   Congress to give him amnesty by a two-thirds vote.

1 But, unless he does that, our Constitution protects 

2 us from insurrectionists. 

3 And, third, this case illustrates the 

4 danger of refusing to apply Section 3 as written 

5 because the reason we're here is that President Trump 

6 tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who 

7 voted against him, and the Constitution doesn't 

8 require that he be given another chance. 

9 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you. 

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Barrett? 

11 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So the general rule is 

12 that, absent rare circumstances, state courts and 

13 federal courts share authority.  State courts have 

14   authority to enforce the Constitution, but there are 

15 certain limits to that, certain situations in which 

16 the Constitution itself preempts the states' ability 

17 to resolve constitutional questions. 

18 And, you know, Tarble's Case is one. And 

19 you said earlier that once a president is elected, 

20 you accepted that a state couldn't do anything about 

21 that, like you couldn't -- Colorado couldn't enact 

22 its own say quo warranto provision and then use it to 

23 get the secretary of state or the president or anyone 

24 else out of office, and I -- I assume that's because 

25 of this principle of structural preemption.

2 MR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor. 

3 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So I just want to 

4 clarify what that means for your argument.  That 

5 means that your eggs are really in the basket of the 

6 Electors Clause, really in the Article I basket, 

7 because you're saying that even though all of the 

8   questions that people have been asking have suggested 

9 that there's a problem with giving a single state the 

10 authority to render a decision that would have an 

11 effect on a national election, but you're saying that 

12 those structural concerns, which might otherwise lead 

13 to the kind of result that you would accept after 

14 someone is in office, are overcome by the Electors 

15 Clause? 

16 MR. MURRAY: Absolutely.  States run 

17   presidential elections.  That's very clear from 

18 Article II. Once states have selected the electors 

19 and the electors have voted, states have no more 

20 power over the -- the candidate who has been then 

21   nominated for president. But, until then, the states 

22 do have the power to adjudicate those issues.

1 earlier about the uniformity concern and the 

2   troubling potential disuniformity of having different 

3   states enforce Section 3 with respect to presidential 

4   elections, you seemed to point to history in a 

5 certain way.  You said, I think, that the Framers 

6 actually envisioned states enforcing Section 3 at 

7 least in some circumstances where there were 

8   insurgents and Confederates. 

9 And I guess, in my view of the history, I'm 

10 wondering really whether presidential elections were 

11 such a circumstance, that the Framers actually 

12   envisioned states enforcing Section 3 with respect to 

13 presidential elections as opposed to senatorial 

14   elections, representatives, the sort of more local 

15   concerns. 

16 So can you speak to the argument that 

17   really Section 3 was about preventing the South from 

18 rising again in the context of these sort of local 

19 elections as opposed to focusing on the presidency? 

20 MR. MURRAY: Well, two points on that, 

21 Justice Jackson.  First is that, as I discussed 

22   earlier, there isn't the same history of states 

23   regulating ballot access at this time, so ballot

14 is -- is that the Framers were concerned about 

15   charismatic rebels who might rise through the ranks 

16 up to and including the presidency of the United 

17 States. 

18 JUSTICE JACKSON: But then why didn't they 

19 put the word "president" in the very enumerated list 

20 in Section 3?  The thing that really is troubling to 

21 me is I totally understand your argument, but they 

22 were listing people that were barred and president is 

23 not there. 

24 And so I guess that just makes me worry 

25 that maybe they weren't focusing on the president,

1 and, for example, the fact that electors of vice 

2 president and president are there suggests that 

3 really what they thought was, if we're worried about 

4 the charismatic person, we're going to bar 

5   insurrectionist electors and, therefore, that person 

6 is never going to rise. 

7 MR. MURRAY: This came up in the debates in 

8   Congress over Section 3 where Reverdy Johnson said, 

9 why haven't you included president and vice president 

10 in the language?  And Senator Moore responds, we 

11 have. Look at the language, "any office under the 

12   United States." 

13 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. But doesn't that at 

14 least suggest ambiguity? And this sort of ties into 

15 Justice Kavanaugh's point. 

16 In other words, we had a -- a person right 

17 there at the time saying what I'm saying, the -- the 

18   language here doesn't seem to include president, why 

19 is that? 

20 And so, if there's an ambiguity, why would 

21 we construe it to -- as Justice Kavanaugh pointed 

22 out -- against democracy? 

23 MR. MURRAY: Well, Reverdy Johnson came 

24 back and agreed with that reading.  "Any office" is 

25   clear, the Constitution says about 20 times that the

1   presidency is an office and --

2 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I don't -- I'm not 

3 going to that. So let me -- let me -- let me just 

4 say you -- so your point is that it -- that there's 

5 no ambiguity with -- with -- with -- with having a 

6 list and not having "president" in it, with having a 

7 history that suggests that they were really focused 

8 on local concerns in the South, with this 

9 conversation where the legislators actually discussed 

10 what looked like an ambiguity, you're saying there is 

11 no -- ambiguity in Section 3? 

12 MR. MURRAY: Let me take the point 

13   specifically about electors and senators if I might 

14 because I think that's --

15 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. 

16 MR. MURRAY: -- important.  Presidential 

17 electors were not covered because they don't hold an 

18 office. They vote.  And -- and this Court's decision 

19 --

20 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I'm talking about the 

21   barred office part of this, right? 

22 MR. MURRAY: Exactly.  So the barred office 

23 is, if you want to include everybody, first, you have 

24 to specify presidential electors because they're not 

25 offices, so they wouldn't fall under any office.

1 Second of all, senators and representatives 

2 don't hold office either.  The Constitution tells us 

3 that under the Incompatibility Clause and refers to 

4 them as holding seats, not offices.  And so you want 

5 to make sure that there is no doubt that senators and 

6   representatives are covered. Given that the 

7   Constitution suggests otherwise, you have to include 

8 them. 

9 The Constitution says the presidency holds 

10 an office, as do members of this Court.  And so other 

11 high offices, the president, vice president, members

1 specifically directed Colorado's courts to resolve 

2 any challenges to the listing of any candidate on the 

3   presidential primary ballot before Coloradans cast 

4 their votes. 

5 Despite this law, Petitioner contends that 

6 Colorado must put him on the ballot because of the 

7 possibility there would be a super majority act of 

8   Congress to remove his legal disability. 

9 Under this theory, Colorado and every other 

10 state would have to indulge this possibility not just 

11 for the primary but through the general election and 

12 up to the moment that an ineligible candidate was 

13 sworn into office. 

14 Nothing in the Constitution strips the 

15 states of their power to direct presidential 

16   elections in this way.  This case was handled capably 

17 and efficiently by the Colorado courts under a 

18 process that we've used to decide ballot challenges 

19 for more than a century.  And as everyone agrees, the 

20 Court now has the record that it needs to resolve

19 12032(a) that a political party that wants to 

20 participate has to have a qualified candidate.

17 candidate's paperwork had even been submitted, and 

18 because there had already been a challenge asserted 

19 and -- and put into the proper court procedure, the 

20   secretary didn't even make that determination because 

21 she didn't have the paperwork. 

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- in 

23 another case where that wasn't the procedure that was 

24   filed, somebody comes in --

25 MS. STEVENSON:  Sure.

1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- maybe they've 

2 got a stack of papers saying here's why I think this 

3 person is guilty of insurrection, it's not a big 

4   insurrection, something that, you know, happened down 

5 the -- down the street, but they say this is still an 

6   insurrection, I don't know what the standard is for 

7 when it arises to that. 

8 MS. STEVENSON:  I think anything that even 

9   presented that level of controversy about one person 

10 having a set of facts that they said proved this 

11 would send this case to the 113 procedure that we use 

12 to resolve ballot challenge issues like that, and if 

13 -- if another elector or the individual who brought 

14 the information didn't want to bring it, the 

15 secretary herself could bring that action. 

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a 

17   provision for judicial review of the secretary of 

18 state's action both in Colorado and perhaps what you 

19 know about other states? 

20 MS. STEVENSON:  Well, certainly, in 

21   Colorado, if -- any action that the secretary takes 

22 that anyone wants to challenge, they can use the 113 

23 process to do so.  I think states have varying 

24 degrees of that.  There are certainly other states 

25 that allow versions of that, and then I don't know

2 know that there are some that do. 

3 JUSTICE ALITO:  I think we're told that 

4 there are states that do not provide for any judicial 

5 review of a secretary of state's determination.  Is 

6 that incorrect? 

7 MS. STEVENSON:  No, no.  I think that's 

8 right, and I think there are some states that 

9 actually have no mechanism, to come to, I think, 

10 Justice Kagan's point, or there are some states that 

11 don't have any mechanism to exclude a disqualified 

12   candidate from the ballot at all.  And I do want to 

13 speak to that for just a minute about the -- the 

14   actual impact of --

15 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would that be 

16   constitutional, if the -- the secretary of state's 

17   determination was final? 

18 MS. STEVENSON:  I think so, under Article 

19 II, the Electors Clause, Your Honor, that that be 

20 would be constitutional.  States get very broad 

21 authority to determine how to run their presidential 

22   elections.

2 civil proceedings? 

3 MS. STEVENSON:  Yes, Your Honor, I believe 

4 it could under the same Electors Clause power. 

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That issue would be 

6   determined under perhaps a different constitutional 

7   provision, like the Due Process Clause, correct? 

8 MS. STEVENSON:  Correct.  The bounds of the 

9 Electors Clause are other constitutional constraints, 

10 which would include due process, equal protection, 

11 First Amendment. 

12 JUSTICE BARRETT:  What's the due process 

13 right? Does the candidate have a due process right? 

14   What's the liberty interest? 

15 MS. STEVENSON:  I think it -- it's not very 

16 precisely defined in the case law, but I think there 

17 is a recognition that there is a -- a liberty 

18   interest of a candidate and -- and there is some due 

19 process interest in -- in being able to access the 

20 ballot. 

21 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I thought that was -- I 

22 thought that was for voters.  You -- you think for

1 think a lot of times you see that in the First 

2   Amendment context, where candidates can have an issue 

3 about being on the ballot, but it's sort of a hybrid 

4 or oftentimes First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, 

5   Qualifications Clause, all discussed together. 

6 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Let me ask you a question 

7 about -- just follow-up to Justice Alito. You know, 

8 these decisions might be made different ways in 

9   different states.  Maybe a secretary of state makes 

10 it in one state with very little process, or a 

11 process more like Colorado's could be followed by 

12 others. 

13 Would our standard of review of the record 

14 vary depending on the procedure employed by the 

15 state? 

16 MS. STEVENSON:  I think this Court has 

17   tremendous discretion to decide its standard of 

18   review, and it might be based on the process that was 

19   employed by an individual state.  I think you could 

20   exercise the independent review of Bose Corp. that 

21 Mr. Murray talked about, or you could give deference 

22 where you have a full-blown proceeding like the one 

23 here that had all the protections of Rules of 

24   Evidence and cross-examination and things like that.

1 You think we should give deference in reviewing the 

2 factual record, the legal conclusions?  What -- in 

3 other words, we shouldn't undertake a de novo review? 

4 MS. STEVENSON:  I don't think the review 

5 should be de novo.  However, I'm -- I am amenable to 

6 the suggestion that the Court would do the Bose Corp. 

7 type independent review that might provide greater 

8 certainty to states around the country as to what the 

9 Court's position is on the factual record in this 

10 case. 

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, if it 

12 were not de novo review, we could reach disparate 

13 results even on the same record, right? 

14 MS. STEVENSON:  I -- I think that's 

15   possible. 

16 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I take it your 

17   position is that this disqualification is really the 

18   same as any other disqualification, age or residence 

19 or what have you. 

20 MS. STEVENSON:  That's correct. 

21 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and -- and what if I 

22 were to push back on that and say, well, this 

23   disqualification, number one, it's in the Fourteenth 

24   Amendment, and the point of the Fourteenth Amendment 

25 was to take away certain powers from the states?

1 Number two, Section 3 itself gives Congress a very 

2   definite role, which Mr. Mitchell says is interfered 

3 with by the ability of states to take somebody off 

4 the ballot?  And maybe, number three, it's just more 

5   complicated and more contested and, if you want, more 

6   political?  And why don't all of those things make a 

7   difference in our thinking about this qualification 

8 as opposed to any other? 

9 MS. STEVENSON:  And so, Your Honor, I think 

10 the trouble with the -- categorizing the insurrection 

11 issue as -- as necessarily more difficult is it's 

12 just an assumption that's coming up, I think, because 

13 of this case. 

14 And, again, back to the Chief Justice's 

15 point, we could have a very easy case under the 

16   Fourteenth Amendment with an avowed insurrectionist 

17 who, you know, came in and wrote on his paperwork, I 

18 engaged in an insurrection in violation of the 

19   Fourteenth Amendment, and it would be a -- a 

20   open-and-shut case as to whether or not that person 

21 would meet the qualifications to be on the Colorado 

22   ballot.

24 the Fourteenth Amendment, my positions are based on 

25 the assumption that, under the Fourteenth Amendment,

1 the states have the power to enforce Section 3, just 

2 like they do other presidential qualifications, and I 

3 would defer to the electors arguments on those 

4 points. 

5 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose a state that does 

6   recognize non-mutual collateral estoppel makes a 

7   determination using whatever procedures it decides to 

8 adopt that a particular candidate is an 

9   insurrectionist. 

10 Could that have a cascading effect, and so 

11 the decision by a court in one state -- the decision 

12 by a single judge whose factual findings are given 

13 deference, maybe an elected trial judge, would have 

14   potentially an enormous effect on the candidates who 

15 run for president across the country?  Is that 

16 something we should be concerned about? 

17 MS. STEVENSON:  I think you should be 

18   concerned about it, Your Honor, but I think the 

19 concern is not as high as maybe it's made out to be 

20 in -- in particularly some of the amicus briefs. 

21 And, again, under Article II, there is a huge amount 

22 of disparity in the candidates that end up on the 

23 ballot on -- in different states in every election.

3 feature of our process.  It's not a bug. 

4 And then I think, with respect to the 

5   decision-making and -- and -- you know, we're here so 

6 that this Court can give us nationwide guidance on 

7 some of the legal principles that are involved.  I 

8 think that reduces the potential amount of disparity 

9 that would arise between the states. 

10 And then, with respect to the factual 

11 record and how that gets issued and implemented, the 

12 states have processes for this, and I think we need 

13 to let that play out and accept that there may be 

14 some messiness of federalism here because that's what 

15 the Electors Clause assumes will happen.  And if 

16   different states apply their principles of -- of 

17   collateral estoppel and come to different results,

1 other questions. We have been told that if what 

2   Colorado did here is sustained, other states are 

3 going to retaliate and they are going to potentially 

4 exclude another candidate from the ballot.  What 

5 about that situation? 

6 MS. STEVENSON:  Your Honor, I -- I think we 

7 have to have faith in our system that people will 

8   follow their election process -- processes 

9   appropriately, that they will take realistic views of 

10 what insurrection is under the Fourteenth Amendment. 

11 Courts will review those decisions.  This Court may 

12 review some of them. 

13 But I don't think that this Court should --

14 should take those threats too seriously in its 

15   resolution of this case. 

16 JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't think that's a 

17 serious threat? 

18 MS. STEVENSON:  I -- I -- I think we have 

19   processes --

20 JUSTICE ALITO:  We should proceed on the 

21   assumption that it's not a serious threat? 

22 MS. STEVENSON:  I think we have 

23   institutions in place to handle those types of 

24   allegations.

17 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

18 MR. MITCHELL:  Both Mr. Murray and Ms. 

19   Stevenson rely heavily on the Electors Clause and the 

20 authority that it gives the legislature of each state 

21 to direct the manner of appointing presidential 

22   electors. 

23 But that prerogative under Article II must 

24 be exercised in a manner consistent with other 

25   constitutional provisions and restrictions.  And

1 Justice Kagan alluded to one of those restrictions 

2 that might be imposed by the First Amendment, but 

3 there are others. 

4 A state cannot use its power under Article 

5 II's Electors Clause to instruct its presidential 

6   electors only to vote for white candidates.  That 

7 would violate the Equal Protection Clause.  But nor 

8 can it exercise its power in a manner that would 

9 violate the constitutional holding of U.S. Term 

10   Limits against Thornton and they cannot use the 

11   Electors Clause as an excuse to impose additional 

12   qualifications for the presidency that go beyond what 

13 the Constitution enumerates in Article II. 

14 And the problem with what the Colorado 

15 Supreme Court has done is they have in a way changed 

16 the criteria in Section 3 by making it a requirement 

17 that must be met before the candidate who is seeking 

18   office actually holds the office, effectively moving 

19 forward in time the deadline that the candidate has 

20 for obtaining a congressional waiver. 

21 There has still been no answer from the 

22   Anderson litigants on how to distinguish the 

23 congressional residency cases, where the courts of 

24 appeals, not decisions from this Court, but the 

25 courts of appeals in applying this Court 's holding

1 in U.S. Term Limits have unanimously disapproved 

2 state laws requiring congressional candidates to show 

3 that they inhabit the state from which they seek 

4   election prior to Election Day. 

5 And there still in our view is no possible 

6 way to distinguish those from the situation below in 

7 the Colorado Supreme Court. 

8 Mr. Murray also invoked the de facto 

9 officer doctrine as a possible way to mitigate the 

10 dramatic consequences that would follow from the 

11 decision of this Court that rejects the rationale of 

12   Griffin's Case and that also agrees with Mr. Murray's 

13   contentions that President Trump is disqualified from 

14 holding office on account of the events of January 

15 6th and that he's covered by Section 3 as an officer 

16 of the United States. 

17 This Court's recent decisions in Lucia and 

18 Arthrex held that officers who are unconstitutionally 

19 appointed under Article II and that made decisions 

20 under the APA that were attacked as invalid, those 

21   decisions were still vacated and this Court did not 

22 use any variant of the de facto officer doctrine to 

23 salvage the decisions that were made by these 

24   unconstitutionally appointed officers. 

25 There is no way to escape the conclusion

1 that if this Court rejects Griffin's Case and also 

2   agrees with Mr. Murray's construction of Section 3 

3 that every executive action taken by the Trump 

4 Administration during its last two weeks in office is 

5   vulnerable to attack under the APA and, further, that 

6 if President Trump is reelected and sworn in as the 

7 next president, that any executive action that he 

8 takes could be attacked in federal court by anyone 

9 who continues to believe that President Trump is 

10 barred from office under Section 3.
