 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-277,

 Moody versus NetChoice. 

Mr. Whitaker.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY C. WHITAKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. WHITAKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Internet platforms today control the 

way millions of Americans communicate with each 

other and with the world.  The platforms 

achieved that success by marketing themselves as 

neutral forums for free speech.  Now that they 

host the communications of billions of users, 

they sing a very different tune. They now say 

that they are, in fact, editors of their users' 

speech, rather like a newspaper. They contend 

that they possess a broad First Amendment right 

to censor anything they host on their sites, 

even when doing so contradicts their own 

representations to consumers. 

But the design of the First Amendment 

is to prevent the suppression of speech, not to

enable it. That is why the telephone company

 and the delivery service have no First Amendment 

right to use their services as a choke point to

 silence those they disfavor.

 Broadly facilitating communication in 

that way is conduct, not speech, and if 

Verizon asserted a First Amendment right to

 cancel disfavored subscribers at a whim, that 

claim would fail no less than the claimed right 

to censorship failed in Pruneyard versus Robins 

and Rumsfeld versus FAIR. 

Social networking companies too are in 

the business of transmitting their users' 

speech. Their users are the ones who create and 

select the content that appears on their sites. 

The plat -- the -- the platforms, indeed, 

disavow responsibility for that conduct in their 

terms of service.  The platforms do sort and 

facilitate the presentation of user speech.  But 

this Court just last term, in Twitter versus 

Taamneh, and the platforms themselves in 

Gonzalez versus Google describe those tools as 

little more than passive mechanisms for 

organizing vast amounts of third-party content. 

The platforms do not have a First

 Amendment right to apply their censorship 

policies in an inconsistent manner and to censor 

and deplatform certain users.

 I welcome your questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, it would 

seem that this case is a facial challenge, and

 to some extent, it relies on the overbreadth 

doctrine, but that seems to be an odd fit since

 Respondent represents virtually all of the 

platforms and that it would be easy enough for a 

platform who's affected to bring an as-applied 

challenge. 

Would you comment on that or at least 

address the fact that this is a facial 

challenge? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Certainly, Your Honor. 

I do think that's a very significant aspect of 

this case.  It comes to the Court on a facial 

challenge, which means that the only question 

before the Court is whether the statute has a 

plainly legitimate sweep. 

I actually don't understand them, Your 

-- Your Honor, to -- to be making an overbreadth 

challenge, which, as I understand it, would --

would rely on the effects on third parties.  As

I understand it, they're principally relying on

 the -- effects on their members. If they were

 bringing an overbreadth challenge, they would --

they would have to show various third-party --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I think -- how

 would they do that on -- when they haven't shown 

that there are no -- there's no way that this 

statute can be applied that's consistent with

 the Constitution?  Have they met that? 

MR. WHITAKER:  They -- they certainly 

have not, Your Honor.  I mean, and -- and we --

we think the -- the statute has, indeed, a 

plainly legitimate sweep. 

And, certainly, there are a number of 

the platforms that are open to all comers and 

content, much like a traditional common carrier. 

And just -- just as a traditional common 

carrier, consistent with the First Amendment, 

would be subject to hosting requirements, 

non-discrimination requirements, so too we think 

that the platforms that satisfy that 

characterization, which are a number of them, 

absolutely would give this statute a plainly 

legitimate sweep.

this is such a odd case for our usual

 jurisprudence.  It seems like your law is

 covering just about every social media platform 

on the Internet, and we have amici who are not

 traditional social media platforms, like 

smartphones and others who have submitted amici 

brief, telling them that readings of this law

 could cover them.

 This is so, so broad, it's covering 

almost everything.  But the one thing I know 

about the Internet is that its variety --

variety is infinite.  So at what point in a 

challenge like this one does the law become so 

generalized, so broad, so unspecific, really, 

that you bear the burden of coming in and 

telling us what exactly the sweep is and telling 

us how there is a legitimate sweep of virtually 

-- or -- or a meaningfully -- a swath of cases

MR. WHITAKER:  I don't think so, Your

 Honor. I still think it is their burden, as the 

plaintiffs challenging an action of a sovereign 

state legislature, to show that the law lacks a

 plainly legitimate sweep.

 But let me just say a word about the 

-- the breadth of the law. The -- the

 legislature did define the term "socia media 

platform," which is part of what triggers the 

law's application, but -- but that -- the 

breadth of that definition, which -- which 

wouldn't cover every single website, it -- it 

would -- it would cover certain large websites 

with large revenues and subscribers and the --

and -- and the like, but the breadth of the law, 

apart from that definition, is significantly 

narrowed by the fact that the substantive 

provisions of the law are regulating websites 

that host user-generated content.  That's what 

the substantive provisions of the statute apply 

to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let me talk 

about Etsy.  Etsy is a marketplace like -- if --

I'm going to try to analogize it to physical 

space, which I think in this area is a little

 crazy because it -- yes, in some ways, this is 

like an online bookstore or online magazines, 

online newspaper, online whatever you want to 

call it, an online supermarket, but it's not 

because, even though it has infinite space, it 

really doesn't because viewers, myself included, 

or users can't access the millions of things 

that are on the Internet and actually get

 through them and pick the things we want because 

there's too much information.  So we're limited 

by human attention spans.  So are they. 

So our theories are a little hard, but 

let's look at Etsy.  Etsy is a supermarket that 

wants to sell only vintage clothes, and so it is 

going to and does limit users' content.  It's a 

free marketplace, it's open to everyone, but it 

says to the people who come onto its marketplace 

we only want this kind of product. 

They're going to have to censor. 

They're going to have to take people off. 

They're going to have to do all the things that 

your law say they can't do without all of these 

conditions. 

Why is that? Why should we be 

permitting and under what level of scrutiny

would we be looking at this broad application of

 this law that affects someone who all they want

 to do is sell a particular kind of product and

 they have community standards and they tell you

 that you -- they don't want you to curse, they 

don't want you to talk politics, they don't want 

you to do whatever, all they want you to do is

 sell your product.  But, if they're a public 

marketplace, which they are, they're selling to 

the public, this law would cover them. 

MR. WHITAKER:  I think that's right, 

Your Honor, but -- but again let me just say a 

word about how the law might apply to Etsy. 

First of all, it wouldn't regulate the 

goods Etsy is offering.  What our law regulates 

is the moderation of user-generated content.  So 

it would only apply to Etsy to the extent that 

they -- and -- and I'm not -- I'm not sure to 

what extent it actually would apply to Etsy.  I 

guess it would apply somewhat, but I guess 

people are uploading user-generated conduct in 

connection with the sale of goods.  And that's 

the conduct that it would regulate.  It doesn't 

limit what goods Etsy can -- can limit its 

marketplace to.

 about the First Amendment, whether our first 

concern should be with the state regulating

 what, you know, we have called the modern public

 square? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Well, I think you

 certainly should be concerned about that, Your

 Honor. What -- what I would say is -- is that

 the -- the kind of regulation that the State of 

Florida is imposing is one that is familiar to 

the law.  When you have businesses that have 

generally opened their facilities to all comers 

and content, this is the way that traditional 

common carrier has worked -- regulation has 

worked for centuries. 

If you were an innkeeper and you held 

yourself out as open to the public, you could 

indeed be permitted to act in accordance with 

that voluntarily chosen business model.  So I 

certainly think the Court should proceed 

carefully, but one thing the Court, I think, 

it's important to keep in mind is that there is 

an important First Amendment interest precisely 

in ensuring that large powerful businesses like 

that that have undertaken to host massive 

amounts of speech and have the power to silence

 And similarly here, I mean, Facebook, 

YouTube, these are the paradigmatic social media 

companies that this law applies to, and they 

have rules about content. They say, you know,

 you can't have hate speech on this site.  They

 say you can't have misinformation with respect

 to particular subject matter areas. 

And they seem to take those rules and

they do seem to take them seriously.  They have 

thousands and thousands of employees who are 

devoted to enforcing those rules.

judgments, not quite as explicit as the -- the

So, yeah.  So, certainly, the more -- the 

broader question about rules of the road and the 

like. 

Common carriers have always conducted 

their businesses subject to general rules of 

decorum.  I think the fact that the platforms 

have these general rules of decorum, the fact 

remains that upwards of 99 percent -- for all 

that content moderation, that's really a product 

of the fact that they have so -- they host so 

much content.  But the fact remains that 99 --

upwards of 99 percent of what goes on the 

platforms is basically passed through without 

review.

MR. WHITAKER:  The fact that some 

people are angry about the content moderation

 policies doesn't show that is their speech.

 And -- and my friends talk about their 

advertisers. Well, we don't know whether the 

advertisers think it's their speech or whether

 they just disagree with the speech.  And their 

advertisers and people who are angry with speech

 don't get a heckler's veto on Florida's law. 

But even more broadly than that, I 

mean, we know that mere -- the -- the fact that 

a hosting decision is ideologically charged and 

causes controversy can't be the end of the game 

because I think Rumsfeld versus FAIR would have 

had to come out the other way then, because, in 

Rumsfeld, certainly, the law schools there felt 

very strongly that the military were being 

bigots and they didn't want them on campus. 

And yet this Court did not look to the 

ideological controversy surrounding those 

decisions.  Instead, it looked at objectively 

whether the law schools were engaged in 

inherently expressive conduct.

 the federal government thought:  Well, if

 MR. WHITAKER:  Well -- Mr. Chief 

Justice, it's difficult for me to argue with you 

very much about what Rumsfeld versus FAIR means. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WHITAKER:  But let me just take a 

crack because, I mean, I -- I think, as I -- as 

I read your opinion for the Court, you didn't 

rely, actually, on the funding aspect of the 

case to reach the conclusion that what was going 

on there was not First Amendment protected 

conduct. You were willing to spot them that 

this -- the -- the question would be exactly the 

same if it were a direct regulation of speech as 

opposed to a funding condition. 

So I absolutely think that the 

analysis in that case directly speaks to this. 

And just -- just --

you about a different precedent, about what we

said in Buckley?  And this picks up on the Chief

 Justice's earlier comment about government 

intervention because of the power of the social

 media companies.

 And it seems like, in Buckley, in 

1976, in a really important sentence in our

 First Amendment jurisprudence, we said that "the

 concept that [the] government may restrict the 

speech of some elements of our society in order 

to enhance the relative voice of others is 

wholly foreign to the First Amendment...".  and 

that seems to be what you responded with to the 

Chief Justice. 

And then, in Tornillo, the Court went 

on at great length as well about the power of 

then newspapers, and the Court said they 

recognized the argument about vast changes that 

place in a few hands the power to inform the 

American people and shape public opinion and 

that that had led to abuses of a -- bias and 

manipulation.  The Court accepted all that but 

still said that wasn't good enough to allow some 

kind of government-mandated fairness, right of 

reply or anything. 

So how do you deal with those two

 enterprises.

 So one provision of the law says that

 the platforms cannot censor, shadow ban, or 

deplatform journalistic enterprises based on the 

content of their publication or broadcast. And 

that serves an interest very similar to the 

interest that this Court recognized as

 legitimate in Turner when Congress imposed on

 cable operators a must-carry obligation for 

broadcasters. 

And -- and just as a broadcaster --

and -- and what the Court said was there was not 

just a legitimate interest in promoting the free 

dissemination of ideas through broadcasting, but 

it was a -- indeed a -- a compelling interest, a 

-- a highly compelling interest. And so I think 

the journalistic enterprise provision serves a 

-- that very similar issue. 

But there are also other interests 

that our law serves.  For example, the 

consistency provision, Your -- Your Honor, is 

really a consumer protection measure.  It --

it's sort of orthogonal to all that.  The 

consistency provision, which is really the heart 

of our law, just says to the -- the platforms:

social media platforms are not like those. And

 why are --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But doesn't it

 depend on exactly what they're doing? I mean, I 

-- I guess the hard part for me is really trying 

to understand how we apply this analysis at the

 broad level of generality that I think both

 sides seem to be taking here. 

I mean, you say what -- what is being 

regulated here is conduct, not speech.  Well, I 

guess maybe if you're talking about Facebook's 

news -- news feed feature. But there are lots 

of other things that Facebook does that -- you 

know, that might be speech, but then there might 

be other things that Facebook does that doesn't 

qualify as speech. 

So don't we have to, like, drill down 

more in order to really figure out whether or 

not things are protected? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Actually, I don't think 

so. I think that that -- that precise ambiguity 

strongly favors our position, Your Honor, 

because, in the posture of this facial 

challenge, all you need to look at is whether

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, but that's --

no, no, no.  I guess what I'm saying is you 

mentioned the Pruneyard case or the FAIR case,

 excuse me. I mean, we didn't say that law 

schools, you know, as a categorical matter are, 

you know, always engaged in unprotected speech. 

We looked at the particular thing. This was a

 fair and, you know, the law school was saying, 

we don't want these certain entities in it. 

I hear you suggesting that we can just 

say, you know, Facebook is a common carrier and, 

therefore, everything it does qualifies as 

conduct and not speech.  And I don't think 

that's really the way we've done this in our 

past precedents.  So can you speak to that? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Sure -- sure. 

Certainly, that's not what we're saying, Your 

Honor. I -- I completely agree with you that 

it's very important to isolate what conduct the 

particular -- each particular provision of the 

law is regulating.

entity.  What is the entity doing?

 MR. WHITAKER:  Well, and I guess the

 right level of generality and the general -- the

to conclude that the law has a plainly 

legitimate sweep is we are talking about the --

 But here's another one for you:  What

 about Section 230, which preempts some of this 

law? How much of it? And how are we to account 

for that complication in a facial challenge?

 MR. WHITAKER:  Well --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Briefly.  Yeah. 

MR. WHITAKER:  Well -- well -- well, I 

-- I think that the Court should answer the 

question presented, I guess. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: But how can we do 

that without looking at 230? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Well, because I -- I --

I don't -- I don't think that there's any --

some of this was briefed at the -- at the cert 

stage, Your Honor.  I don't think that the --

the Section 230(c) preemption -- (c)(2) 

preemption question is really going to dispose 

of the case.  You know, the district court 

actually reached the Section 230 issue but 

concluded that it still had to reach the 

constitutional issue anyway.

MR. WHITAKER:  Well -- well, as I 

understand their contention, it's -- it's the --

this idea that the platforms, in having content 

moderation policies, are somehow creating a 

welcoming community, I guess.  It seems to me, 

at that level of generality, that can't really 

be a cognizable message -- that seems to me more 

like a tautology than -- than a message. 

Basically, we want the people on our sites that 

we want. 

And -- and -- and I think, at that 

level of generality, certainly, the Pruneyard 

case would have to come out the other way 

because, in Pruneyard, the mall certainly wanted 

to ban leafleting because it wanted to create a 

certain environment, and yet this Court said

 right to do that.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  I -- I think what I 

was more interested in is, you know, we're

 talking -- we're using broad terms like "content 

moderation," and throughout the briefs, you have 

"shadow banning," "deprioritizing," and all

 sorts of things.

 And I -- I guess, with these facial 

challenges, I always have a problem that we 

don't -- we're not talking about anything 

specific.  In an as-applied challenge, at least 

we know what's in front of us and what your 

interpretation or at least the state's 

interpretation of its law is in that case.  Now 

we're just speculating as to what the law means. 

So I'm just trying to get more of a --

more specificity as to what the speech is in 

this case.  They are censoring as far as I can 

tell, and I don't know of any protected --

speech interests in censoring other speech, but 

perhaps there is something else.

looking at it I take it my friends from the

 they have a message in censoring and

 platforms were fairly cagey about which of their 

members they thought the statute applied to.

 The -- the record only contains three

 platform-specific declarations:  Etsy, Facebook,

 and YouTube.

 So that -- that's part of the problem

 in this case, is that we -- we -- we don't have

 a sense of -- it -- the record has not been

 fully developed to answer that question, so 

we're kind of litigating in the dark here. 

And this was litigated on a 

preliminary injunction at breakneck speed 

without the -- the State having a chance to take 

discovery, and that's part of the reasons why 

some of these questions are difficult to answer. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'll ask Mr. 

Clement that argument -- that question too.

where in the record would I look to find a list

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does your law cover 

any websites that primarily or even exclusively

 engage in non-expressive conduct?

 MR. WHITAKER:  I think it does cover 

websites that engage in primarily non-expressive 

conduct.  I mean, we would -- we would 

characterize the social networking platforms as 

engaging in primarily non-expressive conduct 

in -- in -- insofar as they are hosting speech, 

just like a traditional common carrier is not 

engaged in -- in expressive conduct in 

transmitting the communications of its 

subscribers.  And we do think our law would 

apply to certainly the -- the largest -- at a 

minimum, the largest social networking 

platforms.

 How should we analyze that?

 MR. WHITAKER:  I think that you would

JUSTICE ALITO:  So we need a -- we 

need a numerator and a denominator there, I

 think. What -- what would they be?

 MR. WHITAKER:  Well, I -- I don't

 think there isn't -- that the standard would 

have a numerator and a denominator.  Actually, 

Your Honor, in this context, we would view it as 

the question being whether the statute has a 

plainly legitimate sweep without the need to 

compare applications. 

As I understand this Court's 

precedents, the numerator/denominator comparison 

would be something you would do if there were an 

overbreadth claim in this case, but I don't 

understand my friends to be making an 

overbreadth claim.  Maybe they'll say something 

different, but I could not find the word 

"overbreadth" in their -- in their pleadings. 

In the Texas case, they do have a footnote 

suggesting that they made an overbreadth claim 

in the alternative.

And because they host so much content,

a sudden they were getting a different online

fact, there were different content judgments

strenuously to the fact that the law schools

people wanted to ban leafleting in the -- at the

230 point.  I think it's Section 6 of your law 

that says that the law is not enforceable to the 

extent it conflicts with Section 230. 

MR. WHITAKER:  Sure, sure -- sure.

 MR. WHITAKER:  Well -- well, the law

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And does that 

complicate our attempt to --

MR. WHITAKER:  Sure.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- resolve things in

 a facial challenge?

 MR. WHITAKER:  Sure -- sure, Your 

Honor. And I think the -- the reason is -- is 

because the law is not facially at least 

preempted under -- under 230(c)(2), which 

principally regulates takedowns. 

One reason for that is we -- we 

understand 230(c)(2) not to sanction 

viewpoint-based content moderation under the 

rubric of otherwise objectionable.  And there's 

a very nice article that Professor Volokh has on 

this in the -- in the Journal of Free Speech Law 

where he lays this out.  And we obviously 

haven't briefed this, Your Honor. 

The second point I would make about 

Section 230(c)(2) is that it only applies to 

good-faith content moderation, so to the extent 

our law prohibits them from engaging in

 bad-faith content moderation, that is absolutely

 not preempted by 230(c)(2).

 And one way to understand their

 constitutional claims in this case, because they 

have an expansive view of Section 230(c)(2), is

 that they are in essence asserting a 

constitutional right to engage in bad-faith 

content moderation because they already have the

 right to engage in a lot of moderation of 

illicit content under 230(c)(2) as long as they 

do so in good faith. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And -- and 

then just to follow up on Justice Kagan's line 

of questioning, you've analogized to common 

carriers and telegraphs in particular. 

Why is that an apt analogy here, do 

you think? 

MR. WHITAKER:  I think it's an apt 

analogy, Your Honor, because the -- the -- the 

principal function of a social media site is to 

enable communication, and it's enabling willing 

speakers and willing listeners to talk to each 

other. 

And it's true that the posts are more 

public, but I don't think that Verizon would

it was a conference call. I don't think that 

UPS or FedEx would gain a greater right to 

censor books because it was a truckload of books

 as opposed to one book.

 And so that -- the analogy is indeed

 apt. And -- and so there's been talk of market 

power. Market power is not an element, I think,

 of traditional common carrier regulation, and, 

indeed, some entities that are regulated as 

common carriers, like cellphone providers, 

operate in a fairly competitive market.

 First Amendment interest in allowing the 

people's representatives to promote the free

 exchange of ideas.  This Court has recognized 

that as a legitimate First Amendment interest in 

the Turner case and all the way going back to

 the Associated Press case when --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, in the

 Turner case, the intervention was, the Court 

emphasized, unrelated to the suppression of 

speech, the antitrust-type intervention there. 

So I'm not sure when it's related to ensuring 

relative voices are balanced out or there's 

fairness in the speech or balance in the speech, 

that that is covered by Turner. 

Do you agree with that? 

MR. WHITAKER:  No, I don't agree with 

that, Your Honor.  Our -- our -- our interest

 Internet platform doesn't like a broadcast it

 showed on -- on its station the other day, that

 interest.  It's giving them a chance.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the editorial 

control point, you really want to fight the idea 

-- and I understand -- that editorial control is 

the same thing as speech itself. And you've 

emphasized Pruneyard over and over again. 

But we have a whole other line of 

cases, as you're aware, of course, Hurley, PG&E, 

Tornillo, Turner, which emphasize editorial 

control as being fundamentally protected by the 

First Amendment. 

And I understood the line between 

Pruneyard on the one hand and those cases on the 

other to be whether you were involved in a 

speech, communications business, as opposed to a 

shopping center owner, which is the other side 

of the line. 

Can you respond to those cases?

control. I just don't think that this -- that 

the social media platforms are engaged in

 editorial control.

 And, again, the -- the -- the

 recruiters -- the law schools, excuse me, in

 Rumsfeld versus FAIR argued that they were

 exercising editorial control when they booted 

military recruiters off campus and invoked 

Tornillo explicitly.  And this Court had none of 

it. 

So the Court does need to draw a line, 

I think, between a selective speech host that is 

exercising editorial control and a speech host 

like a common carrier or like the mall in 

Pruneyard that can indeed be regulated in

customers. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On the selective 

speech host point, I think you've made the point 

to Justice Kagan that they don't eliminate much 

speech.  But didn't we deal with that in Hurley 

as well and say that the mere fact that the 

parade organizer usually took almost all comers 

was irrelevant to the First Amendment interests

in essentially editorial control over who

 participated in the parade?

 MR. WHITAKER:  Yeah, and I -- and I --

and I guess I think Hurley, Your Honor, really 

turned more on the fact that what was the 

activity there was a St. Patrick's Day parade 

with a particular expressive purpose, and so

 perhaps the -- the -- the -- it -- it could 

still be expressive and be a little bit more 

lenient. 

But I would note that this Court in 

Hurley did -- in rejecting the conduit argument, 

relied on the fact that there was front-end 

selection of -- of the members of the parade, 

that the -- the parade committee -- the 

committee that was responsible for it was doing 

front-end selection.  So I do think Hurley fits 

our theory. 

But I also think that selectivity is 

totally relevant to who is the speaker. And I 

-- and we -- we analogize in our brief to the 

government speech cases where this Court has 

made that exact point in a variety of cases, 

such as Matal versus Tam and Shurtleff.  And

 Barrett?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Whitaker, I have 

a question about this editorial control because, 

really, when it comes to platforms that are the 

traditional social media platforms like YouTube, 

Instagram, you know, TikTok, Twitter/X, it all 

rides -- it all turns on editorial control. 

It seems to me that one distinction 

between this and FAIR is that, here, these 

companies are speech hosts, right?  I mean, the 

law schools in FAIR were hosting job fairs for 

this purpose, like online recruiting.  They 

weren't gathering together a whole bunch of

 different, Your Honor, but -- but I think that

 that's why we've -- we've leaned on -- also on 

the common carrier analogy, I -- which I think

 reflects that a -- a speech -- you can't just 

say it's a speech host and go home because, if

 that were true, Verizon could censor.  Excuse

 me.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well -- well, put 

aside common carrier for one second and just 

pretend -- just put common carrier to the side. 

Just tell me why this doesn't look like the same 

kind of editorial control we see newspapers 

exercise. 

MR. WHITAKER:  Because the platforms 

do not review -- it -- it is a strange kind of 

editor, Your Honor, that does not actually look 

at the material that is going on its 

compilation.  I mean, in Twitter versus Taamneh, 

the platforms told you that they didn't even 

know that ISIS was on their platform and doing 

things.  And it is a strange kind of editor that 

does not even know that -- the material that it 

is editing.

algorithm that says, you know, we want to have, 

as Justice Kagan was pointing out, terms of 

service, we want to have this kind of site. You

 know, or -- or -- or some say that, for example,

 TikTok might have boosted pro-Palestinian speech

 and reduced -- reduced pro-Israel speech.

 That's a viewpoint, right?  And if you 

have an algorithm do it, is that not speech? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Well, it -- it -- it 

might be, Your Honor, but -- but, again, in --

in -- in Twitter and Gonzalez, the -- the -- the 

platforms told you that the algorithms were 

methods of organizing -- neutral methods of 

organizing the speech, much like the Dewey 

decimal system. 

JUSTICE BARRETT: Well, that's not 

what they're saying here.  So let's -- let's 

assume that what they're saying here, that 

they're organizing it, you know, in ways that 

reflect preferences, that are expressive of 

their terms and conditions. 

In that event, do you think it would 

be editorial control in a First Amendment sense?

MR. WHITAKER:  No. And -- and I think 

it's important to separate the organize -- and I 

agree with Justice Jackson that it's important

 to separate the various functions -- the 

organizing function from the hosting function. 

And this is a point that Professor Volokh has

 made in his -- in -- in his article that we

 cite.

 I mean, the -- if it -- simply because 

they -- they are required to host certain 

speech, it -- that does not actually 

meaningfully prevent -- prevent them from 

organizing that speech.  So I think the Court 

has to separate out regulation of the 

organization from simply preventing them from 

censoring. 

And the reason, Your Honor, it is 

different from a newspaper, I think, is two 

principal points.  First, we've been talking a 

lot about selection, but, second, space 

constraints.  Space constraints are something 

that this Court in FAIR and in Tornillo relied 

on as one factor that is relevant.  And the

physical space constraints, there are the -- the

limited enough amount of information that the --

the consumer can absorb it. 

And don't all methods of organization 

reflect some kind of judgment?  I mean, could

bookstores that they have to put everything out 

by alphabetical order and that they can't 

organize or put some things closer to the front

customers will want to buy?

apart what exactly the algorithms are doing. 

You certainly could imagine, I think, to be --

you know, to be candid, an algorithm that could

 be expressive.

 As far as we can tell, if the 

algorithms work, though, in the manner that this

 Court described them in Twitter versus Taamneh, 

they look more like neutral ways to reflect user 

choice, and I don't think there's expression in 

that. 

Now you can imagine a different kind 

of algorithm.  If an algorithm -- if it were 

possible to have an algorithm that made a 

website look like a newspaper, that would be 

different.  But, again, I think the Court -- the 

-- the question of organization is analytically 

too distinct from -- from the separate question 

of whether they can be regulated in their 

hosting and censorship. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So your 

argument that it's not expressive entirely 

depends on the hypothesis that the sorting and 

feed functions are solely some sort of neutral 

algorithm that's designed to user preference and 

that they reflect no kind of policy judgment

 MR. WHITAKER:  No. No, not at all,

 actually, Your Honor, because I think that 

preventing them from censoring does not

 meaningfully pre -- pre -- preclude them from

 organizing.

 If they're required to carry a piece 

of content, they can organize it however they

 want generally.  I mean, there are prohibitions 

on shadow banning and the like, but they can 

generally organize it however they want.  So a 

prohibition on censorship and deplatforming is 

not, I think, a meaningful interference with 

organizing. 

But -- but, again, on -- on 

algorithms, I would just stress that this is 

a -- a facial challenge.  We don't have any 

particular information on what exactly their --

the content of their algorithms are.  And so I 

think the only question there is whether there's 

a possible state of the world under which the 

algorithms are non-expressive. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Let me just 

ask you one last question.  It's about the 

facial challenge aspect of this.

So Florida's law so far as I can

 understand it is very broad, and we're talking 

about the classic social media platforms, but it 

looks to me like it could cover Uber, it looks

 to me like it could cover just Google search 

engines, Amazon Web Service, and all of those 

things would look very different.

 And, you know, Justice Sotomayor 

brought up Etsy. It seems to me that they're 

arguing -- now Etsy has a feed recommended for 

you, right, but it also just has shops for 

handmade goods that you can get. It looks a lot 

more like a brick-and-mortar marketplace or flea 

market, you know, than, you know, a place for 

hosting speech.  Okay? 

So, if this is a facial challenge and 

Florida's law indeed is broad enough to cover a 

lot of this conduct which is farther away from 

expression than these standard social media 

platforms, why didn't you then in your brief 

kind of defend it by pointing out, look, there's 

all this other stuff that's perfectly fine that 

Florida covers.  We don't want, you know, some 

person who wants to sell their goods on Etsy to 

be suppressed because it's, you know, stuff --

discussing with Justice Sotomayor, we view Etsy

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- if we agree with 

you that Etsy, it's fine for it to apply to, or 

Uber, it's fine, you know, Amazon Web Services,

enough to just say, well, then this facial

 challenge can't succeed? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Yes, because that would 

give the law a plainly legitimate sweep, and 

that's all the Court needs to -- to address here 

to reject the facial challenge.

Jackson? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I feel like 

there's a lot of indeterminacy in this set of

questions.  We're not quite sure who it covers. 

We're not clear exactly how these -- these

 You've given a couple of -- you -- you've talked

 about the consistency provision, for example, 

and you've represented what you think it means, 

but we don't have a state court determination 

interpreting that provision, do we?

 MR. WHITAKER:  You do not, Your Honor.

 In fact, the -- the -- the law was not allowed

 to go into effect, so the Florida courts have 

not had an opportunity to construe this statute 

at all. 

And I think that counsels strongly in 

favor of rejecting the facial challenge because 

this Court has considered in Washington State 

Grange case the -- the fact that the state 

courts have not had an opportunity to construe a 

state law that's being attacked on its face as 

-- as a reason to reject a facial challenge. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you, do 

you think this statute could be susceptible to 

multiple interpretations?  I mean, I can imagine 

even the consistency provision, you know, well, 

what does it mean that they have to do this 

consistently?  They have to apply the same 

standards, or it has to substantively result in

 narrowly or broadly.

 MR. WHITAKER:  There -- there

 certainly may be some interpretive questions,

 Your Honor.  On that point, I don't think there

 is any -- any ambiguity. And let me just read

 to you what the consistency provision says.  It

 says, "a social media platform must apply 

censorship, deplatforming, and shadow banning 

standards in a consistent manner among its users 

on the platform." 

And the censorship, deplatforming, and 

shadow banning standards are the things that the 

social media company must under a separate 

provision of the law publicly disclose, which 

was a disclosure requirement that the Eleventh 

Circuit upheld.

baseline for comparison is not some abstract

 notion of fairness.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Well, 

let me ask you this about that, all right? So

 let's assume we get to the point we disagree

 with you about whether or not expressive

 activity is covered and we're actually applying 

or trying to determine which standard applies, 

that is, you know, level of scrutiny. 

What I'm a little confused about is 

how we evaluate, for example, the 30-day 

restriction with respect to determining whether 

it's content-based or content-neutral.  I 

appreciate that on its face it doesn't 

particularly -- you know, it doesn't point to a 

particular type of content -- content, but I 

suppose it's applied in reference to content, 

right? 

MR. WHITAKER:  Well, the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I mean, that -- that 

restriction is a regulated entity can only 

change its rules, terms, and engagements once

 content-based restriction or not?

 MR. WHITAKER:  Certainly not. I mean,

 the -- you know, this Court held a couple terms 

ago in the City of Austin case just that simply

 because a regulation requires consideration of

 content doesn't -- doesn't make it

 content-based.  And there's nothing on the face 

of that provision that targets any particular 

message of the platforms. 

And -- and -- and I think just to --

just to zoom out a little bit on the 30-day 

provision, I mean, that provision is really an 

adjunct to the -- the consistency provision as I 

understand it, and -- and the point of it is 

that it wouldn't do much good to require the 

platforms to apply their policies consistently 

if they could just sort of constantly change 

them. And -- and that, I think, is the point --

in the application of even the consistency

doing it consistently, aren't we also looking at

It compels speech. It discriminates on the 

basis of content, speaker, and view -- and

 viewpoint.  And it does all this in the name of

 promoting free speech but loses sight of the 

first principle of the First Amendment, which is 

it only applies to state action.

 Florida defends its law, as you've 

heard this morning, principally by insisting 

that there's no expressive activity being 

regulated.  That blinks reality. This statute 

defines the targeted websites in part by how big 

their audience is.  It regulates the content and 

display of particular websites, and it tries to 

prevent my clients from censoring speakers and 

content. 

If you are telling the websites that 

you are -- that they can't censor speakers, you 

can't turn around and say you're not regulating 

expressive activity.  It's all over this law. 

And that brings it squarely within the teaching 

of Tornillo, PG&E, and Hurley. 

All three of those cases teach that 

you cannot have the forced dissemination of 

third-party speech and they reject 

considerations of market power, misattribution,

or space constraints. And Reno and 303 Creative 

make clear those principles are fully applicable

 on the Internet.

 Indeed, given the vast amount of 

material on the Internet in general and on these 

websites in particular, exercising editorial

 discretion is absolutely necessary to make the

 websites useful for users and advertisers.  And 

the closer you look at Florida's law, the more 

problematic the First Amendment problems become. 

It singles out particular websites, in 

plain violation of Minneapolis Star.  Its 

provisions that give preferences to political 

candidates and to edit -- and -- and to 

journalistic enterprises are content-based in 

the extreme.

when what the government's doing is exercising 

editorial discretion to censor some viewers or

 some speakers and not others, I think that 

plainly violates the First Amendment.

 And I think that's essentially the 

thrust of this Court's decision in the Manhattan

 Community Cable case against Halleck, which is 

that in this area, looking for state action is

 absolutely critical.  There are things that the 

-- if the government does, is a First Amendment 

problem and if a private speaker does, we 

recognize that as protected activity. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Clement, you --

oh, sorry. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- can you give me 

one example of a case in which we have said the 

First Amendment protects the right to censor? 

MR. CLEMENT: So I don't know that the 

Court used that particular locution, Justice 

Thomas, but I think that is the thrust of 

Hurley, that is the thrust of PG&E, that is the 

thrust of Tornillo.  In all of those cases, a 

private party did not want to convey and 

disseminate the speech of a third party.  And in

some really good reason here why this private 

party has to disseminate the message of a third

 party. And --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I've been fortunate 

or unfortunate to have been here for most of the 

development of the Internet.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  And on the argument 

under Section 230 has been that you're merely a 

conduit, which it -- exact -- that was the case 

back in the '90s and perhaps the early 2000s. 

Now you're saying that you are engaged 

in editorial discretion and expressive conduct. 

Doesn't that seem to undermine your Section 230 

arguments? 

MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Thomas, I mean, obviously, you were here for all 

of it. I wasn't here for all of it. But my 

understanding is that my clients have 

consistently taken the position that they are 

not mere conduits. And Congress, in passing 

Section 230, looked at some common law cases 

that basically said, well, if you're just a pure 

conduit, that means that you're free from

 publisher, by keeping some bad conduct out --

content out, then you no longer have that common

 law liability protection.

 And as I understand 230, the whole 

point of it was to encourage websites and other

 regulated parties to essentially exercise 

editorial discretion to keep some of that bad 

stuff out of there, and as a result, what 

Congress said is -- they didn't say:  And you're 

still a conduit if you do that.  No, it said: 

You shouldn't be treated as a publisher, because 

Congress recognized that what my clients were 

doing would, in another context, look like 

publishing, which would come with the kind of 

traditional defamation liability, and they 

wanted to protect them against that precisely to 

encourage them to take down some of the bad 

material that, if these laws go into effect, 

we'd be forced to convey on our websites. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Clement, can I 

ask you about the facial nature of this? 

Because my understanding is that, to strike down 

this statute as facially unconstitutional, we 

would have to conclude that there's no possible

 So, first, do I have the standard

 right?

 MR. CLEMENT: With all due respect, I

 don't think so.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MR. CLEMENT: In the First Amendment

 context, as my friend was indicating, the 

question is whether or not the statute has a 

plainly legitimate sweep.  So it's not the 

Salerno, if there's one little application 

somewhere, that's enough to save the statute. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, I mean, whose 

burden is that?  I thought it was your burden to 

say that this statute, in almost all of its 

applications or in most or a substantial number 

or something, would be unconstitutional in order 

to get it facially stricken. 

MR. CLEMENT: So two things, Your 

Honor. I think our burden would be -- it would 

be our burden to say that this statute doesn't 

have a plainly legitimate sweep. In fact, it is

below and succeeded, that this statute actually

 You -- so no application, but we have

applies to websites that are a handful of 

websites that meet the viewership threshold or 

the total sales threshold. 

And it's -- you know, it's not our

 little bit of an impossible case to say you 

can't go after big companies under the First

 Amendment.

 after all the social website -- media websites

MR. CLEMENT: Because Minneapolis Star 

says it is, because Arkansas Writers' Project 

says it is, and because, if you actually got to 

analyzing their so-called consumer protection

 interest, the consumer protection interest would 

be exactly the same for a website with 99 

million global users as it would be with a 

website with a hundred million global users. 

And so I think there are red flags over all of 

the distinctions drawn in the statute. 

And then, if you look at the statute 

more closely, I mean, my goodness, the political 

candidates provision says that you can't have 

posts about a political candidate.  I can't 

imagine anything more obviously content-based 

than that.  That's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, is 

there --

MR. CLEMENT: -- unconstitutional in 

every one of its applications. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is there 

any aspect of the service that -- provided on 

the social platforms that is not protected under 

the First Amendment or that is plainly valid 

under the First Amendment?

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I think it's all

 protected by the First Amendment.  I mean,

 obviously --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Direct mess --

direct messages?

 MR. CLEMENT: I -- I -- I think direct 

messages are protected under the First 

Amendment. I think that the courts that have

 looked at things like whether Gmail is a common 

carrier have actually held that -- and there's a 

case involving the RNC that has a specific 

holding that Gmail is not a common carrier.  I 

think much of the logic of that would apply to 

direct messaging. 

Obviously, if this were a statute that 

tried to address my clients only to the extent 

that they operated a job board, this would be a 

lot closer to FAIR and I might have a harder 

case. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So, Mr. Clement, the 

government says your brief sometimes errs in 

suggesting that conduit-type activity is always 

expressive.  And direct messages, Gmail, I -- I 

take it your view then is that providers can 

discriminate on the basis -- political views,

 MR. CLEMENT: So, Justice Gorsuch, I

 think you have to distinguish between two

 things.  One is sort of a status-based

 discrimination, and the other is status as 

speaker. And so I don't think that our clients 

could discriminate and say you can't be on our 

service, you can't even get access to our 

service on the basis of race. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, there's -- but

MR. CLEMENT: So --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm talking about 

the content of their speech. 

MR. CLEMENT: Yeah.  I think, when it 

comes --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  That it has 

something to do with religion or politics or 

race, you can editorialize and use that 

editorial power to suppress that speech, right?

yes, we can -- we can delete emails, we can 

delete direct messages that we don't agree with 

based on politics, religion, or race?

 MR. CLEMENT: Probably not in 

application, but I do think, look, a bookstore, 

if it wants to have a display this month to

 celebrate black history, can they limit that

 display just to African American authors?  I

 think the answer is probably yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And so it is here 

too, right? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I think the answer 

is that there's at least First Amendment 

activity going on there, and that -- and then 

you would apply the equal protection clause to 

it, and then you would decide whether or not 

that's permissible or not. But, obviously, I 

think this case involves editorial decisions at 

its heart. 

And one thing I just want to make 

clear on the facial challenge point just so you 

understand how this case came to be, as you 

heard today, my friend's principal argument is 

this doesn't cover expressive activity at all.

eggs in that basket and they specifically said,

 look, we don't want to do intermediate scrutiny 

at the preliminary injunction stage, so we 

really only have an argument to resist this 

preliminary injunction if you hold that this is

 not expressive activity.  And they did the same

 thing in the Eleventh Circuit.  There's a -- we 

-- we have a footnote in our brief making it 

clear on the pages exactly where they did this. 

So they basically said:  We either 

want to win this on the threshold question that 

this is not expressive activity, or we don't 

want to get into the rest of it at this point. 

We'll have some discovery and we'll have the

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that okay? 

MR. CLEMENT: I don't think that's

apply, like, on comments on the drivers or 

comments section on something like that if Uber 

wants to just sort of -- and -- and -- and Etsy, 

I think it's the same way. 

You know, Etsy has an ability for you 

to put comments on the seller and whether they 

did a nice job or a bad job.  And Etsy doesn't 

want certain comments on that, and they want to 

clean that up to keep it to be a better place 

for people to come and look at materials.

 But, obviously, the core of the 

statute and the motivation for the legislation 

and the examples that my friends from Florida

 include in their own petition appendix are about

 much more expressive activity by the YouTubes

MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely you can 

escape that in this posture. You affirm this 

preliminary injunction which is in place. If 

you want to, you can point to the clear

 litigation judgment that Florida expressly made

 below, which is we're not going to get into all

 of that intermediate scrutiny stuff.  We don't

 want a record on that. We're going to put all 

our eggs in the expressive activity basket, and 

they could not have been more clear about that 

below and in the Eleventh Circuit, and then you 

say this law which has all of these First 

Amendment problems, this wolf comes as a wolf, 

we are going to put that on hold and then we can 

sort out some of these tertiary questions. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that's the 

case, Mr. Clement, to what extent is it the --

is it the result of your own litigation 

decisions?  You could have brought an as-applied 

challenge limited to the two platforms that you 

want to talk about, Facebook and YouTube. 

But, instead, you brought a facial 

challenge, and you claim that it's also 

susceptible to analysis under overbreadth.  So

MR. CLEMENT: It is still a facial

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And so, again, you

 think all of the applications are

 unconstitutional, right?

 MR. CLEMENT: I -- I do because the

 definitions are problematic, the terms --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So there's nothing 

to sort out on remand.  It's done.  If -- if you 

should prevail in this -- on a -- on a 

preliminary injunction here, I mean, for 

practical purposes, it's finished, and so there 

is no opportunity to sort out anything on 

remand. 

MR. CLEMENT: There's the whole 

merits.  What we've shown is a likelihood of 

success on the merits.  We haven't won on the 

merits yet. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All or nothing.

 So, if we come up with some scenarios 

in this context in which we can envision it not 

being unconstitutional, why don't you lose?

 MR. CLEMENT: First of all, that's not

 the standard with all due respect.  I mean, this

 Court has never applied the Salerno standard in 

a First Amendment case.

 And this would be the worst First 

Amendment case in this Court's history if you 

started down that road because you can always 

put in some provision into a statute that's 

innocuous and then you say, well, there's a 

couple of fine things in there. 

You look at it section by section and 

these sections are pernicious from a First 

Amendment standard, can't have content about a 

political candidate.  There's no constitutional 

application to that.

 MR. CLEMENT: I -- I think that's one 

way to put it. Obviously, you have two

 questions presented.  You're going to be able to 

decide whatever you think is fairly included in

 those questions presented.

 I'm just pointing out that as an 

artifact of the way my friend's litigated this

 case, you do not have a record on everything 

that might be interesting for intermediate 

scrutiny, and it's not my fault. It is based 

precisely on their representations to the courts 

below that they did not want to get into the 

intermediate scrutiny thing, they wanted to tee 

up the expressive activity issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if the 

appropriate standard is not Salerno, could you 

articulate what you think is the appropriate 

standard? 

MR. CLEMENT: I think the -- the 

appropriate standard is whether the First 

Amendment -- the statute that implicates the 

First Amendment has a plainly legitimate sweep.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Could you again

 explain to me why, if you win here, it does not

 present a Section 230 problem for you?

 MR. CLEMENT: If we win here, we avoid 

Section 230 problems, I think, Your Honor, and

 the reason is that 230 is a protection against

 liability.  It's a protection against liability 

because Congress wanted us to operate as

 publishers, and so it -- it -- it wanted us to 

exercise editorial discretion, and so it gave us 

liability protection. 

But liability protection and First 

Amendment status don't go hand in hand. I don't 

think the parade organizer in Hurley was 

responsible for the parade floats that go --

went into its parade.  Historically, newsstands 

and others aren't responsible for the materials. 

So -- so I don't think you have to 

sort of say it's one or the other. I mean, I 

think the 230 protection stands alone. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what is it that 

you are editing out that fits under Section 230? 

MR. CLEMENT: So, in some of these --

I mean, it depends on -- you know, in -- in some 

cases, it is terrorist material. In other

 position that we're protected in those judgments

 under 230.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I think you'd 

make that, the ejusdem doctrine, do a lot of

 work. But let's put that aside.

 Tell me again exactly what the 

expressive conduct is that, for example, YouTube

 engages in when it -- it -- it -- or, I'm sorry, 

Twitter deplatforms someone.  What is the 

expressive conduct and to whom is it being 

communicated? 

MR. CLEMENT: So, when they, you know, 

let's say deplatform somebody for violating 

their terms of use or for continuing to post 

material that violates the terms of use, then 

they are sending a message to that person and to 

their broader audience that that material --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  How would you know 

someone's been deplatformed?  Is there a notice? 

MR. CLEMENT: Typically, you do get a 

notice of that, and there's a provision --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, I mean the

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't think so,

 Your Honor.  These algorithms don't spring from

 the ether.  They are essentially computer 

programs designed by humans to try to do some of 

this editorial function and is --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, but what do you

 do with a deep-learning algorithm which teaches

 itself and -- and has very little human

 intervention? 

MR. CLEMENT: You -- you still had to 

have somebody who kind of created the universe 

that that algorithm is going to look at. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So who's speaking 

then, the algorithm or the person? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I -- I think, the, 

you know, the question in these cases would be 

that Facebook is speaking, that YouTube is 

speaking, because they're the ones that are 

using these devices to run their editorial 

discretion across these massive volumes. 

And the reason they're doing this, 

and, of course, they're supplementing it with 

lots and lots of humans as well, but the reason 

they have to use the algorithms, of course, is 

the volume of material on these sites, which

actually, we are talking about terrorism here

 because I think, if these laws go into effect --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But I thought that

 was a crime.  I mean, under -- they -- the -- as 

I understood Florida, they said that they --

they -- one provision in the Act says they --

nothing that's inconsistent with Section 230. 

It seems to me that it is consistent with 

Section 230. 

MR. CLEMENT: So, Your -- Your Honor, 

it is -- you know, there are things like, if --

if you have a video on how to build a bomb to 

blow up, you know, a church or something, maybe 

that's prohibited by sort of, you know, the --

that -- that kind of illegality provision. But, 

if there's something glorifying the attacks of 

October 7, and one of these companies wants to 

keep that off of the sites, or is there 

something on there that they want to -- that 

sort of glorifies sort of, you know -- sort of 

incredibly thin teenage bulimia and they want to 

keep that off their site, they -- they have the 

right to do that.  And that's an important 

message.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  There's a lot of new 

terminology bouncing around in these cases, and 

just out of curiosity, one of them is "content 

moderation." Could you define that for me?

 MR. CLEMENT: So, you know, look, 

content moderation to me is just editorial 

discretion.  It's a way to take the -- the --

the -- all of the content that is potentially 

posted on the site, exercise editorial 

discretion in order to make it less offensive to 

users and advertisers. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it -- is it 

anything more than a euphemism for censorship? 

Let me just ask you this.  If somebody in 1917 

was prosecuted and thrown in jail for opposing 

U.S. participation in World War I, was that 

content moderation? 

MR. CLEMENT: So, if the government's 

doing it, then content moderation might be a 

euphemism for censorship.  If a private party is 

doing it, content moderation is a euphemism for

difference between the two.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  For editorial

 discretion, are you affirmatively saying --

 never mind.  No -- no further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, I'm 

-- I'm now sort of trying to take all of this 

in, and I think that I came into this very 

differently than you have.  I came into this 

thinking there are different functionalities by 

websites.  So some host news, like the news feed 

in Facebook.  Some host -- like Justice Barrett 

was talking about and others, Gmail or -- where 

they're just letting people contact each other, 

direct messaging. 

And I was thinking that since I think 

rightly this law seems to cover all of that, 

that it's so broad, how -- but that it might 

have some plainly legitimate sweep, it might be 

okay to require direct messaging to give you 

notice, to be consistent, to pay attention to --

to 30-day registration.  Some of these 

provisions might be okay for those functions.

But you're saying to me that's not

 true. Can you articulate very succinctly why 

you think, at this stage on a facial challenge, 

that we can say there is no plainly legitimate 

sweep, that this particular law, after we sort 

it all out below, will still survive?

 Now I think the court below said --

and you try to take that out from Justice

 Kagan's answer -- maybe I don't want to, okay, 

is it because this law was passed with viewpoint 

discrimination in mind?  That's what the court 

below said. 

MR. CLEMENT: The -- the -- the court 

below said that.  And that would be a sufficient 

basis to take out the whole law. 

The law is also shot through with 

content-based provisions.  I think that's enough 

to take out the whole law.  It also -- the 

entire law, every provision we challenge is 

speaker-based in its limited reach. 

And what this Court's cases clearly 

say, including NIFLA, which my recollection is 

was a facial challenge, says that when you look 

at speaker-based distinctions, you can then open 

the lens a little bit and see if those

discretion sort of leaps out. 

So this law didn't touch those.  But

it said, you know, with respect to Gmail and 

direct messaging and Venmo and Dropbox and Uber, 

with respect to all of those things, a site

 could not discriminate on the basis of 

viewpoint, just as maybe a site couldn't 

discriminate on the basis of race or sex or 

sexual orientation or what have you. So it just

 added viewpoint to the list.

 Wouldn't that be all right? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I actually don't 

think it would be all right because all of those 

things are still in the expressive business. 

And I also think --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you think 

that -- you know, suppose it didn't say 

viewpoint; it just said you can't discriminate 

on the basis of, you know, all the usual 

protected characteristics.  Is -- is that all 

right? 

MR. CLEMENT: That would probably be 

all right, but it wouldn't save the whole

 legitimate sweep, because all it's saying is 

that when you run a service where you're not 

speaking, unlike in Facebook feed, where your

 editorial discretion argument is good because

 the -- the -- the platform is engaged in speech 

activities. 

Well, when you're running Venmo, 

you're not engaged in speech activities.  And 

so, when a state says to you, you know what, you 

have to serve everybody, irrespective of whether 

you like their political opinions or not, then 

it seems you have a much less good argument, but 

this statute also says that, doesn't it? 

MR. CLEMENT: Not really, Justice 

Kagan. And I think we're in danger of losing 

sight of the actual statute.  So let me take you 

to Petition Appendix 97A and the definition of 

"censor" used in the statute.

to post, remove, or post an addendum to any 

content or material posted by a user. The term

 also includes actions to inhibit the ability of 

the user to be viewable or to interact with

 another user of the social media platform."

 Censor is all about the expressive

 activity.  Post-prioritization is all about it.

 It specifically talks about a news feed, a feed, 

a view, search results, and they give 

essentially political candidates and 

journalistic enterprises a right to sort of 

non-discrimination, so they're going to pop up 

there even though, like, I have no interest in 

politics, I just want to look at, you know, 

feeds about Italian bicycles, and I'm still 

going to get these Florida politicians popping 

in there?  That's what this statute does. 

And then you go through, shadow ban. 

Shadow ban's not about any of the things you're 

talking about.  Shadow ban is all about content. 

And then we go to journalistic enterprises. 

They get pride of place. 

Then we talk about 

post-prioritization.  That's all about how you

 well, that applies to, like, Uber, but even

 then, if Uber wants to change its comment 

policies because all of a sudden, you know, they 

did one thing to try to, you know, deal with one 

set of issues and then a problem comes up and

 there's a whole bunch of, like, people using the 

comments in a really rude way, like, why 

couldn't they change their editorial policy on 

the -- on the comments?  I just don't understand 

it. 

And then all of the duty-to-explain 

provisions.  The duty-to-explain provisions are 

all driven by decisions to exclude conduct --

content.  And that happens a billion times a 

quarter at YouTube.  So that's a crushing blow. 

It has nothing to do with some of the other

being used in lots of different ways.

 So, when the government censors, when 

the government excludes speech from the public 

square, that is obviously a violation of the

 First Amendment. 

When a private individual or private 

entity makes decisions about what to include and 

what to exclude, that's protected generally

 editorial discretion, even though you could view 

the private entity's decision to exclude 

something as "private censorship." 

MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely.  That was 

the whole thrust of this Court's decision in 

Halleck.  And I suppose the Hurley case might 

have been a completely different case if that 

was an official City of Boston parade and the 

City of Boston decided to exclude the group. 

The whole reason that case came down 

the way it did unanimously is because it was a 

private organization exercising its First 

Amendment right to say we don't want GLIB in our 

parade.

does 303 fit into that?

just further evidence that, you know -- I mean, 

you know, obviously, I think 303, where 303 is 

most relevant is that, you know, Colorado in

 that case tried to rely on FAIR, much the way my 

friends here rely on FAIR, and this Court made

 clear in 303 Creative, no, it doesn't work that

 way. You know, this is expressive activity.

 And -- and -- and so -- you know, and 

-- and the fact that my friend's best case is 

FAIR, I think, just shows how radical this 

statute is, because this targets expressive 

activity in its core. 

If the Solomon amendment said to the 

law schools, you have to give the military equal 

time in the classroom, I think the case would 

have been 9/0 the other way.  And that's 

essentially what the -- what -- what Florida is 

trying to do here. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then, on the 

procedural posture, I think this is important to 

try to understand what's exactly before us, and 

you've gotten questions on this, but I want to 

nail it down for my -- my benefit, which is you 

said that they came in and opposed a PI solely

not expressive activity or speech but, instead,

 conduct.

 Is that accurate?

 MR. CLEMENT: That -- that -- that's 

accurate. It came up in the context of how much

 discovery we were going to have before we had

 the preliminary injunction hearing, and in that 

context, the State says, look, we -- we're going

 to sort of, you know, kind of rest on this kind 

of threshold question, as my friend said, and 

that we'll limit discovery on both sides and 

then, in the Eleventh Circuit, it was even more 

clear because, in the Eleventh Circuit, the 

position of the State of Florida was like, we're 

not going to really engage on intermediate 

scrutiny at all.  We're -- we -- we're putting 

all our eggs in the expressive eggs basket.

in some respects and we affirm in this case, 

what is left to Justice Gorsuch's question? 

What's left to happen -- that just means it

MR. CLEMENT: So there'll be

 litigation on the merits.  I don't even think

 we're past the point where we could amend, so if 

this Court tells us we sure better have an

 as-applied challenge in there, I suppose we

 could do that.

 But the point is the litigation will

 go on. There will be discovery. Unless --

unless Florida decides at that point that the 

writing's on the wall and it tries to pass a 

more narrow statute, but, otherwise, there would 

be discovery, there would be, you know, 

essentially, the whole nine yards.  But, in --

in the interim, I -- and -- and, you know, I 

just can't emphasize enough particularly that 

$100,000 civil penalty provision. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  All that's before 

us then is what should happen in the interim 

before final judgment and it comes back to us 

potentially a year or two from now.  Should it 

be in effect or not be effect until it comes 

back to us? 

MR. CLEMENT: Yeah. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Correct? 

MR. CLEMENT: If it comes back to you.

 Because I don't think we've heard much about

 exactly what you're concerned about.

 In other words, you're very concerned

 about this.  That's obvious.  But what -- what 

are the specifics of that? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I mean, 

honestly, if this statute goes into effect, we'd 

sort of have to fundamentally change our 

business models, and I think each company is 

going to make their own judgment about how 

they'd come into compliance.

here is that as to one of -- you know, they --

they say this is going to promote speech, but --

but they allow us to discriminate on the basis 

of content as long as we do it consistently.

 one way that -- because, you know, these same

for us to keep material that's -- that's harmful

much material off of our sites that nobody can

MR. CLEMENT: I -- honestly, I'm not

 sure -- well, I'm not sure you could reach that 

result without definitively holding that that

 stuff is within the plainly legitimate sweep of 

the statute. You don't have the record for that

 in part because of litigation decisions that

 were made by the State of Florida.  So I think 

what you would do is you would affirm the 

preliminary injunction, and then you would 

perhaps lament the fact that the record here is 

somewhat stunted, and then you would make clear 

that there might be a possibility to modify the 

preliminary injunction on -- on remand. 

Now, at that point, I think, when the 

lower court sort of sees all the details about 

how these things actually operate, they might 

not have the same skepticism that you're 

starting with.  But I think there's lots of ways 

to write the decision that keeps the -- you --

you know, and, again, what's -- what's in place 

right now is a preliminary injunction for the 

benefit of my clients. 

So people that haven't sued yet, I 

mean, you know, the statute in theory could 

apply to them.  But my clients have the benefit

what they can say in the public square. 

But what do you do with the fact that

And I appreciate that these companies are 

private companies, but if the speech now is

that censorship is only something the government 

can do to you. And if it's not the government, 

you really shouldn't label it "censorship."

 It's just a category mistake.

 But here's the second thing:  You 

would worry about this if websites, like the 

cable companies in Turner, had some sort of 

bottleneck control where they could limit your 

ability to go to some other website and engage 

in speech.  So, if the way websites worked was 

somehow that if you signed up for Facebook, then 

Facebook could limit you to only 19 other 

websites and Facebook could dictate which 20 

websites you saw, then this would be a lot more 

like Turner. 

But, as this Court said in Reno in 

1997, when it was confronted with an argument 

about the then-fresh Turner decision, this Court 

basically said the Internet is like the opposite 

of Turner.  You know, there's so much 

information out there, the -- it's so relatively 

easy to have a new website come on and, like, 

reality tells us that, right? You know, like, X 

is not what Twitter was, and TikTok came out of 

nowhere.  And --

 I get your point.

 MR. CLEMENT: Yeah.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let me just ask you

 about the illegitimate sweep point.

 So what is illegitimate about a

 government regulation that attempts to require

 these companies to apply consistently their

 procedures?  I don't -- I guess I don't 

understand why the enforcement of sort of 

antidiscrimination principles is illegitimate. 

MR. CLEMENT: So consistency when what 

is being regulated -- as a -- as a government 

mandate when what is being regulated is 

expressive activity is, I think, a clear First 

Amendment violation.  And I don't think -- I 

mean, you know, some of these judgments are very 

tricky judgments.  You know, okay, well, we --

we're going to -- we're going to take some of

 straight --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, and so why

 isn't that enforcing antidiscrimination

 principles with no candidate -- if somebody is a

 candidate for office, they can't be

 deplatformed?

 MR. CLEMENT: So that means they can't 

be deplatformed no matter how many times they 

violate my client's terms of use, no matter how 

horrible their conduct, no matter how 

misrepresenting they are in their speech.  We 

still have to carry it and not just have to 

carry it, but under this statute, we have to 

give it pride of place. 

And it doesn't take much to register 

as a candidate in Florida. And so this gives a

2 percent in their local precinct, they can post 

anything they want, they can cause us to 

fundamentally change our editorial policies and

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

    SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The First Amendment protects entities 

that curate, arrange, and present other people's 

words and images in expressive compilations.  As 

this Court's cases have -- has held, those 

principles cover newspaper editors, parade 

sponsors, and web designers.  It also covers 

social media platforms.  Those platforms shape 

and present collections of content on their 

websites, and that inherently expressive 

activity is protected by the First Amendment. 

That doesn't mean, though, that every 

business that transmits speech can claim First 

Amendment protection for that conduct.  For 

example, telephone and delivery companies that 

carry speech from point A to point B aren't 

shielded by the First Amendment when they 

provide that service.  But that's because

 they're not producing any expression of their 

own. It's not because there's some kind of

 common carrier or communications company

 exception to the First Amendment.

 None of this is to say that social

 media platforms are immune from government

 regulation.  And governments at every level 

obviously have an important interest in 

facilitating communication and the free exchange 

of ideas.  But, in promoting that interest, 

governments have to stay within the bounds of 

the First Amendment.  And these state laws which 

restrict the speech of the platforms to enhance 

the relative voice of certain users don't 

withstand constitutional scrutiny. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Normally, you are 

defending regulations.  But are you -- if -- if 

-- if the U.S. Government did exactly what these 

Petitioners -- Respondents are doing, would that 

be government speech?

understanding the hypothetical correctly, 

Justice Thomas, if you're suggesting that the 

government itself would open a forum and allow

public forum where it would itself be bound by

 the Constitution.

 I don't think that that would all 

necessarily qualify as the government's own

 speech. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  But the critical 

difference here, of course, is that these 

platforms are private parties.  They're not 

bound by the First Amendment as an initial 

matter. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  The -- Mr. Clement 

said the difference is that if the government 

does it, it is censoring. If a private party 

does it, it is -- I forget -- content 

moderation.  These euphemisms bypass me 

sometimes.  But -- or elude me.  The -- do you 

agree with that distinction?

example, dictate what kind of speech has to

 appear and in what order, you know, that -- that 

could create a First Amendment violation.

 But, here, it's the private platforms 

themselves that are making that expressive

 choice.  And -- and our recognition here is that 

they're creating their expressive -- their own

 expressive product in doing so. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Now --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  These are websites 

that are featuring text elements, speech 

elements, photos, videos, and the platforms, 

which are private parties not bound by the 

Constitution, are deciding how they want that to 

look, what content to put on it and in what 

order. That's an inherently expressive 

activity. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What are they saying? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So it depends on 

the platform, the -- the various value judgments 

that are embodied in its content moderation 

standards, you know.  The -- the -- I think 

there's a wide variety in the kind of content 

that the platforms deem objectionable, the --

the kind of content they think might be harmful 

or will drive away users and advertisers. 

There's no one single message that each platform

 is conveying.

 But I guess, if you wanted to look at 

the lowest common denominator, you know, at the 

very least, it seems like their content 

moderation policies embody a judgment of this is 

material we think might be of interest to our 

users or that the users will find interesting 

and -- and worthy of looking at. 

So it's a lot like the parade in 

Hurley in that circumstance, where the Court 

specifically said maybe you're lenient, you let 

a lot of content in, you can't identify a single 

discernable message from the parade as a whole, 

but there is still the baseline of the parade 

sponsors signaling this is something that's 

worthy of looking at in my parade. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  General, you -- you 

indicate in your brief that NetChoice sometimes 

errs by suggesting that the dissemination of 

speech is always expressive activity.  And I

fact if I agree with you in this facial

 challenge context and particularly when many of 

the platforms, while reserving the right to 

prohibit various kinds of posts, most of which 

are consistent with Section 230, also say and 

guarantee users "a right to express their ideas 

and opinions freely." I'm quoting from one of

 them. And even if the platform disagrees and 

they say that they "do not endorse and are not

 responsible" -- again, I'm quoting from some of 

these terms of service -- sure sounds a lot like 

conduit, doesn't it?

literally engaged in carrying speech, 

transmitting it, whether that's across the 

telephone wires or via telegraph or on a 

delivery truck like UPS and FedEx, a big 

difference between that kind of conduct --

conduit and what the platforms are doing here, 

because they're not just literally facilitating 

users' ability to communicate with other users. 

Instead, they're taking that and arranging it 

and excluding it.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I acknowledge 

that their terms of service also include the --

the right to exclude certain -- certain speech,

 but those are usually like the Section 230 

things, the way they discuss it, the lewd, 

lascivious, obscene, the blah, blah, blah, and 

after that, they do seem to promise a whole lot 

of latitude. 

And when you look at classic common 

carriers, it's very similar.  It's -- they don't 

give up the right to exclude certain -- certain 

activities or speech that might be detrimental 

to their business or that might be otherwise 

regulated.  That -- that holds true for 

telegraphs.  It holds true for telephones even. 

But, beyond that, bare minimum, 

they're open to all comers, and that seems to be 

how a lot of them are representing themselves to 

the public at least. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The key difference, 

though, with common carriers, the -- the kinds 

of industries that have traditionally been 

regulated, those in the transportation sector,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, the telegraph

those claims failed --

they aren't themselves creating any speech on

were. They -- they -- in fact, they curated a 

lot of the speech or tried to, including 

political speech which they didn't agree with.

to call that curation.  It's certainly true they 

tried to adopt certain discriminatory

And if it's now their communication in 

part, do they lose their 230 protections?

different types of speech.  There are the

the way that the platform shapes that expression

 that -- that they're not going to be held liable 

in part because it isn't their expression, it --

they are a conduit for somebody else? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, not at all, 

Justice Gorsuch. I think, you know, to the 

extent that the states are trying to argue that 

Section 230 reflects the judgment that the 

platforms aren't publishing and speaking here, 

there would have been no need to enact Section 

230 if that were the case. 

Congress specifically recognized the 

platforms are creating a speech product.  They 

are literally, factually publishers.  And 

Congress wanted to grant them immunity.  And it 

was for the purpose of encouraging this kind of 

editorial discretion.  That's the whole point of 

the "Good Samaritan" blocking provision, 

230(c)(2)(A). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, 

there's been a lot of talk about the procedural 

posture of the case, how it was litigated below, 

what's available if it -- it goes back, when it

presented our arguments in this case taking the 

way it had been litigated at face value, and

 what that means is that below Florida treated 

this law as though the central provision and

 scope was focused on the -- the true social

 media platforms, the thing that -- the website 

you have in mind when I use that term, things 

like YouTube and X and Facebook.

 And Florida's presentation to the 

lower courts was this law isn't a regulation of 

their speech at all and so it's valid. 

So I understand the force of the 

questions that the Court has been asking today 

about are there other types of websites that 

might be covered, could this extend to direct 

messaging.  You know, we don't really have a dog 

in that fight.  To the extent that there are 

those other applications of the law out there, 

that's not how Florida sought to defend it. 

And to Justice Barrett's question, you 

know, what should the Court do with this, it's 

been litigated one way and now it looks like 

maybe there are other possible applications you 

would have in mind, I would urge the Court to 

take a really narrow approach here.

Florida defended this law on the basis

 that it could control what the true social media

 platforms are doing with respect to their 

expressive websites, and if I were the Court, I 

would really want to reserve judgment on the

 application to e-commerce sites, to -- to

 companies like Uber, which don't seem to be

 creating a comparable type of expressive

 product. 

And I think the Court could save those 

issues for another day or for further factual 

development in this case while looking at the 

decision on the record that was created based on 

those litigation judgments by the parties.

were likely to succeed on their facial

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  They made that

 overarching argument, but they didn't go further

 here's direct messaging.  And it's lawful as

 applied to that --

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Well, do

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think that the 

way Florida litigated this case makes it 

difficult to say that the issue is properly 

before you.  Usually, the Court holds a party to 

the arguments it pressed below and that were 

passed upon below, and there is no court in this

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the record is

 insufficient to allow us to comfortably decide 

whether the facial stand -- facial challenge 

standard or an overbreadth standard is met, 

isn't that the fault of the plaintiffs, and 

isn't the remedy to vacate and remand for all of 

that to be fleshed out, and that would not mean 

-- that wouldn't say anything necessarily about 

what will happen in the near future. 

It would mean that it would be 

litigated and perhaps, if the plaintiffs 

developed the record in the way that Florida 

thinks they should and provides a -- a list of 

all of the -- all of the NetChoice members who 

are covered by this and goes through all of the 

functions that they perform and assesses whether 

the law is unconstitutional in every application 

or whether it has a legitimate scope that is 

constitutional, then they would be entitled to a 

preliminary injunction. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I certainly 

don't want to resist the idea that if this Court 

thinks those issues are properly before it and 

affect the analysis of the facial challenge,

notwithstanding the way the parties litigated

 the case, I -- I don't want to stand in the way

 of that.

 I do think there would be a lot of 

value, though, in the Court making clear that 

with respect to Florida's defense of this law in

 the lower courts, namely, the idea that the 

state really can control the curation and

 editorial function of the true social media 

platforms with respect to their expressive 

product, that seems to me a type of provision 

that is invalid in all of its applications with 

respect to those platforms. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just ask you 

to comment on a few things I understood Mr. 

Clement to say. 

So I understood him to say that an 

email -- that the email function could be denied 

on the basis of -- access to that could be 

denied on the basis of viewpoint.  Direct 

messaging could be denied on the basis of 

viewpoint.  Do you -- do you agree with that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, we disagree 

with that.  We think that both direct messaging 

and email service seems a little more like the

likely put those in the box of the phone 

company, the telegraph company, Internet service 

providers, and so forth.

 We don't think that that's an

 inherently expressive product in the same way as

 the main website that has the news feed and 

that's curating the stories and deciding how to

 prioritize them.

violates the First Amendment?

regulate based on the size of a company is -- is 

always a First Amendment problem.

private party cannot engage in censorship?  Let

law school says that any student who expresses 

support for Israel's war with Hamas will be 

expelled.  Is that -- would that be censorship,

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah.  So I guess

 the first-order question would have to be, is

 there some kind of regulation that prohibits the

 law school from acting in that way?  So, if 

you're thinking about a public accommodations

 law, for example --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No. I'm just saying 

-- I'm just talking about terminology. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Oh, colloquial 

terminology?  You know, I -- I --

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's -- that's not 

censorship; that's content moderation --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I -- I -- I think 

that --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- because it's a 

private party? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- the semantics of 

it don't matter. You could say that the parade 

in Hurley was censoring the -- the GLIB 

contingent that wanted to march or that the 

newspaper in Tornillo was censoring the 

candidate who wanted to publish his speech.

And I think what's clear is -- from

 our questioning -- that that's not true, that

 there are many functions that are expressive

 that we can't say are common carriers.  But, 

even if we did say they were like common

 carriers, it -- the issue would be one of what's

 the level of scrutiny. 

And the State said there's no level of 

scrutiny we're going to address. They basically 

said we can do anything we want to common 

carriers and to any of the expressive 

platforming or deplatforming things. 

But I don't even think that's true. 

They can't come in and -- I -- and I'm not sure 

they can -- do any of these things or some of 

these things even to common carriers if it -- it 

is a sort of content or viewpoint content 

exclusion. 

So a common carrier doesn't have to 

permit unruly behavior.  Doesn't have to permit 

-- it can throw somebody off the train if they 

are threatening somebody else or if they're 

doing other things. 

So I -- I guess what you're saying is 

let's keep the injunction in place, vacate and

but vacate and remand on the application of this 

law and how based on what level of scrutiny

 given the function that's at issue, correct?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So we do think that

 the Court should hold the parties to the way 

they litigated this case and teed it up for the

 Court's review.  And it's uncommon for the Court 

to start considering new arguments that weren't 

presented by the party defending its law below. 

But -- but, if I can respond for a 

moment on the common carrier point, Justice 

Sotomayor, because I think you've put your 

finger on a really important response here to 

many of the arguments that Florida is making. 

They suggest that the designation of a 

platform as a common carrier or not has some 

kind of talismanic significance. But it's 

completely irrelevant to answering the First 

Amendment question because it's not like 

companies that are treated as common carriers 

have no First Amendment rights with respect to 

their expressive activities.

Amtrak and you can regulate it as a common

carrier with the transportation of passengers, 

but if it creates some kind of magazine for 

those passengers to peruse, that's entitled to 

-- to full First Amendment protection.

 And the reason that the

 non-discrimination mandate in the common carrier 

scenario usually poses no problem under the

 First Amendment is there's no speech or 

expressive activity in carrying passengers or in 

carrying communications. 

It's entirely different with respect 

to the activity that Florida is seeking to 

regulate because that is inherently expressive. 

It's putting together literally a website with 

pictures and video and text and arranging it. 

And that looks just like the kind of protected 

editorial and curatorial activity the Court has 

recognized in other cases. 

So whether you say they're a common 

carrier or not we think is entirely beside the 

point.

pretty much what you said. Let's just take that 

as an assumption, which is, you know, when

 Florida is trying to regulate Facebook news 

feed, well, it can't do that because Facebook 

news feed is itself providing a kind of speech

 product.

 But, when Florida is trying to 

regulate Gmail, well, maybe it can do that

 because Gmail is not in the business of 

providing that sort of speech product.  And if 

you take it -- and if we again assume that this 

statute covers a variety of things that are 

Gmail-like, direct messaging and -- and Uber 

and, you know, things that are not creating 

speech products, and we have this First 

Amendment doctrine that says, if you can find a 

legitimate sweep, we can't overrule something 

facially, but you don't really want to keep --

you -- you don't want -- really want to allow 

this law to go into effect because of the 

unconstitutional applications that you're 

talking about with respect to all these 

companies that are creating speech products, 

what do we do?

were confident that the state law had these

 applications and that the particular provisions

 would regulate the kinds of -- of companies that 

you're referring to that aren't creating an 

expressive speech product, then I think that

 that would poke holes in the theory of facial

 invalidity.

 But I don't think you can have that

 certainty because that's not how Florida 

litigated this case below.  It's not as though 

it said this statute is not invalid on its face 

because it applies to Gmail or other --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I take your 

point. We could just say, gosh, we can't -- we 

can't even think about those questions because 

this was litigated in a certain way.  So that's 

one option. 

But suppose we think it's pretty 

obvious that this covers a lot of stuff that 

does not look like Facebook feed and we wanted 

-- I mean, suppose we were to -- you know, we --

we can take notice of that, then what?

at that point, what I would do if I were the

issues Florida did present and that the Eleventh 

Circuit and the district court resolved, Florida 

is wrong to say that it can apply these 

provisions to the social media companies that 

are engaged in creating an expressive product

 and make that much clear.

 Otherwise, I think, if the Court just 

vacates and sends it back, it'll be right back

 up here on -- in an emergency posture, again on 

an as-applied basis, with respect to one of 

those companies.  So I think the Court can 

decide that much.  That was the issue that was 

litigated below and decided. 

And then, if you think that there are 

some additional questions about the scope of the 

Florida law and whether it might have valid 

applications along the lines we've been 

discussing, you know, I -- I don't have a 

particular interest on behalf of the United 

States in what you do with the preliminary 

injunction in the meantime.  I think there's a 

lot of force to the idea that this is backed up 

by $100,000 in penalty per violation, and that 

could have a huge chilling effect on any 

protected speech out there that's occurring.

 state taking over media, like in some other

 countries.  And in Tornillo, we made clear, the 

Court made clear, that we don't want to be that 

-- that country, that we have a different model 

here and have since the beginning, and we don't 

want the state interfering with these private

 choices.

 Now Tornillo then dealt with -- and 

this is my question. Tornillo dealt with the 

idea, well, newspapers have become so 

concentrated and so big that maybe we should 

have a different rule. In Tornillo, in -- in 

the Court's opinion, Chief Justice Burger's 

opinion for a unanimous court talked about those 

-- those changes. I mentioned those before. 

He says, those changes have placed in 

a few hands the power to inform the American 

people and shape public opinion. "The abuses of 

bias and manipulative reportage are said to be 

the result of vast accumulations of unreviewable 

power in the modern media empires.  In effect, 

it is claimed the public has lost any ability to 

respond.  The monopoly of the means of 

communication allows for little or no critical 

analysis of the media."

And then, though, he -- and he says, 

"From this premise, it is reasoned that the only

 effective way to ensure fairness and accuracy to 

provide for some accountability is for

 government to take affirmative action."  And

 then he goes on and explains no, we're not going

 to do that.  The First Amendment stands against

 that. "However much validity may be found in 

these arguments, at each point, the 

implementation of a remedy calls for some 

mechanism, either government or consensual.  And 

if it's governmental, that's just one brings 

about a confrontation with the express 

provisions of the First Amendment.  Compelling 

editors or publishers to publish that which 

reason tells them should not be published is 

what is at issue in this case." 

And so he says for the Court in 1973, 

no, we're not -- we don't have a big exception 

to the idea that the First Amendment 

distinguishes the state from the private sector 

and private individuals. 

Now my -- here's my question.  We're 

50 years later.  How does that principle 

articulated in Tornillo apply to the current

situation, the current bigness?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think that

 Tornillo does establish a bright-line

 proposition that the -- the state, even if it 

has these concerns about market power and

 dominance and control, cannot directly overtake 

the editorial function and prevent a private

 party that's creating an expressive product from 

making those kinds of judgments about how to 

present that product. 

But, at the same time, I think that 

there are legitimate concerns here about the 

kind of power and influence that social media 

platforms wield.  And I want to emphasize it's 

not like the government lacks tools to deal with 

this. It's not as though it can't regulate at 

all. There is a -- a whole body of government 

regulation that would be permissible that would 

target conduct, things like antitrust laws that 

could be applied or data privacy or consumer 

protection, things that we think wouldn't come 

into any conflict with the First Amendment at 

all.

regulate in a manner that's going to affect 

protected speech rights, that's not the end of

 the inquiry. You still have a chance as the 

government to establish that your regulation can 

pass constitutional muster like it did in the 

Turner case that you were referring to earlier.

 So I want to be very clear that we are 

not suggesting that governments are powerless to 

respond to some of the concerns that Justice 

Alito mentioned.  You know, I think one natural 

place to go as a government is to disclosure, to 

ensuring that if you think that platforms have 

Orwellian policies, you at least make sure users 

have information about how they're acting, what 

their policies are, the kind of generalized 

disclosure requirements here that were not 

invalidated by the lower courts and aren't 

before this Court. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On Turner, the key 

was content-neutral there, right? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So Turner 

concluded that the interest -- the governmental 

interest --

 the suppression of expression.

 And the problem here, you know, my

 friend suggested that Florida has precisely the

 same interest.  But, here, the interest that 

Florida has asserted in affecting these content 

moderation choices is to change the speech on 

the platforms. It doesn't like the way that the

 platforms are moderating content and it wants 

them to create a new expressive product that 

reflects the state's judgments about what should 

go on the website, whether that's candidate 

speech or speech by journalistic entities or 

otherwise. 

And that is just not an interest 

that's unrelated to the suppression of 

expression.  So we think the Court should apply 

intermediate scrutiny here and find that the 

State can't get out of the starting gate with 

that interest.

 which Justice Kagan also asked you, and so I

 just want to be sure that I'm understanding

 maybe exactly your answer to Justice Kagan.  It

 was different than Mr. Clement's to me.

 You were pointing out to Justice Kagan 

that if we just vacate and send it back, it's 

going to be right up here in an emergency

 posture on an as-applied challenge. So you were 

encouraging us to address at least this question 

of whether, like, the Facebook news feed or 

YouTube, et cetera, is expressive. 

But, if I think there are real 

problems with some of these other applications, 

which may be legitimate, do you think it's an 

option to say, you know, that we think that some 

of these editorial applications would be 

unconstitutional, but because we don't know 

about these other applications, they might be 

within the statute's legitimate sweep, that 

we're going to vacate and remand anyway and send 

it back for the court to sort out all of those 

other applications? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: So I think that 

would be one possible approach here.  You know, 

I want to express strong agreement with the

 instinct I think that is -- is -- underlies that 

question that the Court shouldn't do more than 

is necessary here with respect to the types of 

applications that we've been discussing,

 e-commerce, you know, Gmail, or -- or websites

 or -- or email servers and that kind of thing.

 I do think they present a really

 distinctive set of issues.  And so, if you think 

that those issues are properly in this case, 

I -- I don't think the Court has received the 

briefing, frankly, to try to take a stab at 

resolving them, but it seems like it would be a 

reasonable thing to do to send it back for 

further factual development and consideration by 

the lower courts. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And one other 

question and this is about Section 230. 

When you were talking to Justice 

Gorsuch, you were pointing out the distinction 

between the post and the post's content for 

which, you know, the -- the platform would not 

be liable, and then the feed, and you were 

saying, well, the speech -- the speech that is 

the platform's is not what's on the post, and 

that's -- you know, the -- the platform can't be

liable for that.

 So could a platform be liable then, 

say, if its algorithm or its feed boosted things

 like, say, the Tide POD challenge?  That's

 different.  Is that within Section 230?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah.  So I -- I

 think that this is, you know, a difficult issue

 about how 230 might apply with respect to kind 

of decisions that the platform is -- is making 

itself with respect to how to structure its 

service. 

And I want to be careful here because 

I have to confess that I haven't gone back 

recently to look at the brief we submitted in 

the Gonzalez case last term that I think touched 

on some of these issues, but I do think that 

there are circumstances where, of course, if the 

thing that's causing harm is the platform's own 

-- own conduct in how it structures its service, 

that's something that might not be immunized 

under Section 230. 

I think all of this is separate and 

apart from the First Amendment issue in this 

case, though, because, here, whether or not you 

think that, you know, recognizing that they have

a speech product affects the proper

 interpretation of the statute under 230 and

 means that there are some situations where they

 won't have immunity, that is a completely 

distinct question from whether they are creating 

a speech product that warrants First Amendment

 protection.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I totally agree.

 But I also think there are a bunch of land 

mines. And if that's a land mine, if what we 

say about this is that this is speech that's 

entitled to First Amendment protection, I do 

think then that has Section 230 implications for 

another case, and so it's always tricky to write 

an opinion when you know there might be land 

mines that would affect things later. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And I -- I 

certainly would think the Court could try to 

carefully cabin it and make clear that it's not 

opining on the specific statutory terms in 230 

or whether this First Amendment characterization 

of the expressive compilation fits within the 

provision that Justice Gorsuch cited earlier 

about creating speech in whole or in part, and 

the Court could very clearly outline that in its

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  General, I hear you 

struggling valiantly to set aside other kinds of 

applications in response to a number of the 

questions, and I guess I can't figure out why 

those other applications aren't in this case. 

I mean, I think Florida defended the 

law as NetChoice challenged it, and NetChoice 

brought a facial challenge.  And I had 

understood that to mean -- I mean, first, I was 

a little surprised that the government's brief 

didn't focus on that, but I had understood that 

-- stood that to mean that NetChoice, number 

one, bears the burden in this case and, number 

two, that NetChoice has to, you -- you know -- I 

guess Mr. Clement and I had a difference of 

opinion as to how you say it, but that burden is 

to show that there's either no valid application 

of this law or that the law has a legitimate 

sweep. 

So, if we can identify other valid

applications, if we see worlds in which Uber 

and, you know, money services or whatnot could

 be regulated, I don't understand why that does 

-- just doesn't mean that NetChoice has not met 

its burden and so that's the answer.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, I think you

 would have to conduct it at a more granular 

level, Justice Jackson, because it's not just 

about what are the universe of platforms out 

there and what functionality do they offer. 

You'd really have to parse the 

challenged provisions of the Florida law and 

ask: Are those platforms, you know, engaged in 

any kind of the relevant conduct?  And I think 

that --

JUSTICE JACKSON: I agree with you 

100 percent, but the question is, isn't it 

NetChoice's burden to have presented the case to 

us in that way?  If we don't have that 

information, again, I say, don't they lose? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I want to say 

again that we don't have a particular stake in 

how you think about their own litigation

about what they called the Big 3 social media

 companies.  That's clearly the central aim of

 this law.  It was focused not on the Ubers of 

the world and their comment boxes but on the

 core function of creating an expressive website

 that principally contains user-generated 

components, the text and the photos and so

 forth, and the -- the provisions that are 

challenged here are the ones that are focused on 

the type of editorial discretion that those 

types of platforms are engaged in. 

So I don't think it's as easy to say 

maybe we can look in the dark recesses of this 

law and peek around a corner and find some 

possible valid application.  That's not how 

Florida sought to defend the law. And I think 

it would go down a complicated road to allow the 

core provisions of this statute to take effect. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I understand, 

General, but the confusion --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I think, is that 

the law on its face is really broad.  We've said 

that. And other people, many people, have, you 

know, noticed that it could apply to all sorts

of things. And yet you say it was litigated

 below as if it was narrow.  I appreciate that. 

But we have a facial challenge on the -- on the

 table.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And to the extent

 the entire law goes, then I suppose maybe these

 other lawful applications would go too. And

 isn't that problematic when you're talking about 

facial challenges? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, you are 

looking at this in the posture of a preliminary 

injunction, so I don't think that the Court is 

definitively resolving and -- and, you know, 

kind of issuing the final say on exactly what 

the status of this Florida law is. 

But -- but, look, I -- I want to 

agree, I have some sympathy here.  In 

preparation for this argument, I've been working 

with my team to say, does this even cover direct 

messaging?  Does this even cover Gmail?  And 

we've been trying to study the Florida law and 

figure it out ourselves.  We think there's a lot 

of ambiguity about exactly what the state law 

provisions require.

I -- I don't think, though, that 

that's a basis to not resolve the central issue 

in the case, which is, with respect to what we 

know the state law does, it would require these 

social media platforms that are creating the

 compilation of third-party speech to

 fundamentally alter their product that they're

 offering.  We think that's an infringement of 

speech and the Court should say so.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY C. WHITAKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. WHITAKER:  First, on the 

procedural posture, the fact that there's no 

record in this case is entirely NetChoice's 

fault. It was NetChoice who insisted in 

district court on litigating the PI very fast. 

In fact, we actually wanted to slow it down and 

take discovery.  And what NetChoice -- and we 

actually even offered to voluntarily stay the 

law while we did that. And NetChoice says, no, 

we want to go fast.  And they -- and the

district court obliged them, went fast. There

 was no meaningful opportunity to take discovery.

 And, in fact, when we appealed, we

 tried to say, hey, let's litigate this case

 while it's on appeal and do discovery.  And they

 said, no, we want to stay discovery even while 

it's on appeal. And the district court obliged. 

So the fact that there's no record in this case 

is not Florida's fault. It is NetChoice's 

fault. 

Second, there are clearly 

constitutional applications of this statute, and 

contrary to what my friend said, it does apply 

to Uber.  And he read you the definition of 

"censorship" on 97a, and right before that is 

the definition of "deplatforming."  And Uber --

if Uber deplatforms a -- a user, that is covered 

by our law.  If users -- if Uber says to a 

journalistic enterprise, I don't like the -- the 

cut of your jib, the broadcast you -- you did 

last week, that is covered by our law. And so 

that -- that is something that is there. 

There -- and there are also -- you 

know, there -- it's not just Gmail.  It's also 

WhatsApp.  There are messaging functions.  Those

are constitutional applications. And the 

consequences of my friend's argument is really

 quite sweeping.  My friend seems to think that 

-- that even a traditional common carrier has a

 First Amendment right, I guess, to -- to censor

 anything.  I guess that means that Verizon can 

turn around tomorrow and have a First Amendment 

right to kick all Democrats or all Republicans

 off of the -- the platform, and that is -- that 

would have sweeping consequences that I -- I do 

not think is supported because Verizon has no 

message in deplatforming or censoring its users. 

And that principle is distinct from 

what my friend from the United States is saying 

because she's talking about, oh, well, they 

arrange material on the site in various ways. 

But that doesn't speak to -- at all to whether 

they have a constitutional right to censor 

because just because you have to carry content 

or carry a particular user, you could still 

arrange it. 

And -- and I think that's the 

fundamental conflation -- conflation that the 

United States does in its brief. It -- it 

ignores the distinction between the hosting
