 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 23-367, Starbucks

 Corporation versus McKinney.

 Ms. Blatt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Section 10(j) authorizes district 

courts to grant preliminary injunctions that 

they deem just and proper.  10(j) thus requires 

district courts to apply the traditional four 

factors as set out in Winter versus NRDC. 

This Court should reverse.  The court 

of appeals held that Winter's four factors do 

not apply under Section 10(j).  All that 

mattered below was whether any facts supported a 

non-frivolous legal theory and whether there was 

harm, not whether that harm was irreparable. 

The government argues that whether a 

two- or four-part test governs, the statutory 

context compels district courts to conduct "a 

less exacting and more deferential inquiry into

the merits," "without undertaking an intensive

 effort to resolve factual issues."  But 10(j) 

contains no language, much less clear language, 

diluting the traditional standard.

           Preliminary injunctions are

 extraordinary and drastic remedies.  Here, the

 Board seeks a coercive injunction backed by 

contempt sanctions, and the Board seeks the very 

same injunctive relief that it would get if it 

won the case. 

Such relief is highly inappropriate 

absent a clear showing under all four factors. 

The government justifies deference because the 

Board, not trial courts, ultimately decide the 

merits at the back end.  But Congress directed 

trial courts, not the Board, to apply the Winter 

factors at the front end. 

The Board hasn't even made any factual 

findings to defer to. Agencies have no 

expertise whatsoever in how courts should 

exercise their equitable discretion.  Indeed, 

the Board in its adjudication will not even 

consider the four Winter factors.  This Court 

has never deferred to an agency's litigation 

position, and it should not start here.

I welcome your questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Blatt, the

 government says that "Petitioner's ahistorical,

 decontextualized approach is inconsistent with

 the statutory text, the basic premises of 

equity, and over a century of caselaw."

 What's your reaction to that?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. BLATT: No. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BLATT: I don't even know where 

they're getting that.  I mean, this Court in 

Winter and a million other cases has said that 

these four factors are longstanding, and the 

clear statement rule goes back to Justice Story. 

But I just think the text on its face, you don't 

have to get too far, says "just and proper." 

That's obviously harks to traditional equity. 

And, here, we have the four factors. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you think their 

real -- their -- the government argues that 

you're -- because they are protecting the 

Board's jurisdiction, as opposed to the courts' 

jurisdiction, that that's a difference. 

MS. BLATT: Not at all.  Not at all.

I mean, a preliminary injunction -- I mean, it's 

assigned to the district court. It has the same

 reasons.  You have to show that there's a

 likelihood of success on the merits.  And,

 obviously, if the harm is recoverable, you're 

not entitled to the injunction at all in balance

 of the equities.

 There's no -- I don't even understand

 the Board's jurisdiction.  There are a multitude 

of contexts where an agency has an adjudication, 

and if it wants a preliminary injunction, it's 

got to make the showing that every other party 

would have to make. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: But this is not just 

the standard preliminary injunction that 

district courts do on a daily basis in regular, 

ordinary cases within their jurisdiction that 

they control.  I mean, this is an injunction 

that is being provided for in a specific 

paragraph of this statute, which I'm sure you 

agree, does, the statute, require some 

consideration of the Board's prerogatives.  The 

Board is the one that is ultimately making this 

unfair labor practice determination in the first 

instance.  Congress is setting up a Board to

take care of these issues.

 So it's -- it's not the ordinary PI

 that the -- that district courts see, correct?

 MS. BLATT: No, not at all. It is an 

ordinary preliminary injunction, and this is an 

ordinary statute with a call to just and proper

 remedies.  And we cite six statutes in the U.S. 

Code that use the "just and proper" standard and 

a multitude of statutes saying "necessary and 

proper" or just "proper." 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand, 

but we are in a particular context, and I think 

the context has to inform how we understand what 

Congress intended with respect to this provision 

of the statute providing for this kind of 

injunction. 

MS. BLATT: Well, maybe we should just 

talk about what we're talking about, and that is 

does anything in that statute or anything in 

common sense say the Board gets to walk in and 

get a coercive injunction on the notion that 

they have a non-frivolous legal theory and the 

-- district court is barred from finding facts,

 presented a joke.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well what -- I guess

 what I'm -- what I'm referring to is that we 

already have a very different context insofar as

 the Board is assigned by Congress with the 

requirement or duty to investigate unfair labor

 practices and make the decision in the first 

instance as to whether or not they occurred.

 That doesn't happen in other PI 

contexts.  So I get that in other PI contexts 

the district court is doing the fact finding and 

all of the things you're talking about.  This is 

a different context. 

MS. BLATT: So, on pages 42 and 44 of 

our brief, we cite SEC, FTC, CPFC -- I'm going 

to run out of the alphabet -- EEOC, a bunch of 

cases where agencies have adjudicatory 

processes.  There's three that we cite on pages 

23 and 42 where it involves you can go to 

district court. 

But, remember, neither the Board nor 

the court of appeals on -- on reviewing of a 

final agency will ever consent or -- consider 

the normal standards for preliminary injunction. 

It -- I mean, we just in terms of

where all this leads you is why would the Board 

get deference when the Board doesn't deserve any 

deference and has no expertise on how equity

 should be -- should be weighed? And in terms of 

-- we could talk about the four factors. At

 most, statutory context, like every other

 injunction, takes account of -- of the statutory

 context.  If we were here because there was

 going to be a nuclear accident, I would think 

that's an important statutory context too. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Blatt, you've 

used in your brief 12 times the description of 

using the stringent version of the four-factor 

test. Is that different than the standard 

four-factor test? 

MS. BLATT: This Court in the Pharma 

versus Walsh and in Winter said "clear showing," 

so -- but, yes, I think that is a stringent --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's different 

than the traditional? 

MS. BLATT: Traditional factor test is 

a clear showing.  And what I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, all right. 

Now you're doing something else.

MS. BLATT: Okay.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understand very 

well why you say we don't give deference to the 

Board on the likelihood of success on the

 merits, which -- there's some language in some 

of the court's decisions below that they think 

they have to, and that's the stuff about not

 weighing credibility, et cetera.

 I -- I do understand why that needs to 

be corrected because, you're right, it's the 

court that has to decide the likelihood of 

merits. 

But, with respect to the other three 

prongs -- irreparable harm, balance of the 

equities, public interest -- in Winter and Nken, 

we talked about that there has to be a 

recognition of the -- the public interest, the 

Navy's interest in doing what it needs to do, 

the -- here, I think it's in the NL -- NLRB's 

interest in making sure that its remedial power 

can be returned after the status quo. 

We have to consider in the balance of 

equities the court below, the harm both to the 

employer but the harm to the union and the harm 

to the NLRB.  And, finally, the public interest

is clear in the -- the Board's requirement.  So

 it's -- I -- I don't know that either Winter or 

Nken or anything else -- the word "deference" is

 just misplaced here.

 MS. BLATT: Well, so we've gotten

 likelihood of success off the table, but on both 

the court of appeals and the trial court refused 

to find any facts even on the irreparable harm. 

So all the Board cited the evidence and only one 

cited the evidence was considered on irreparable 

harm. 

And in terms of irreparable harm, 

that's something that district courts do day in 

and day out.  And what the Board has here and 

has been arguing in all these cases and what the 

court of appeals found is anytime there's an 

unfair labor practice, if you can show evidence 

of chill because people are afraid of being 

retaliated against if they support the union, 

then -- and I'm quoting from the NLRB -- that 

"faith in workplace democracy can never be 

restored." 

And so, in their manual, their 10(j) 

manual, it's basically a playbook and every case

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- it's hard to

 MS. BLATT: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the ALJ who's 

made factual findings here to whom the Court 

will have to eventually give deference found 

that at least two of these union representatives 

should have been fired because they did 

something more than stay after hours. 

MS. BLATT: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There were 

employees there who were staying after hours 

that weren't fired. 

MS. BLATT: Remember, we -- we're here 

on the injunction.  Obviously, the -- the ALJ's 

findings don't deserve any deference.  If 

there's a final decision by the Board and that 

goes to a court of appeals, they get substantial

 standard, if all eight employees commit gross 

misconduct, then there's a -- you know, that's a

 basis for termination.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there were two 

others who didn't union organize that weren't

 fired. 

MS. BLATT: And one union organizer 

didn't engage in the misconduct and wasn't 

fired. But here's --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You -- you don't

that fact that --

MS. BLATT: Sure. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- Justice Sotomayor

weighing whether an injunction's warranted? 

MS. BLATT: Absolutely.  I mean, this 

is a classic case of burden-shifting, was there 

anti-union animus that justified -- that -- that 

prompted the terminations, and Starbucks' 

managers explained that -- and the employees 

conceded this violated company policy, so the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, pretextual, 

and a district court could make that

 determination the way the ALJ did perhaps.

 MS. BLATT: Exactly.  The problem

 in -- in the circuit split is, and in this case

 in particular, both the district court and the 

court of appeals said district courts are barred 

from considering the evidence.  And if you count 

the -- the Board's theory that whenever you have 

a harm to unionization, and their story is union 

support is very fragile, whether it's before the 

union's been voted in or after the union is 

voted in, and any type you -- anytime you have 

an unfair labor practice, that's irreparable 

harm. And we're just saying no.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  You'd be happy with

 that, the balance?

 MS. BLATT: Very happy for Factor 3. 

But Factor 2 is irreparable harm.

Is that the irreparable harm factor you're 

talking about? 

MS. BLATT: Balance of the equities

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Oh, I -- I see. All 

right. So irreparable harm, what -- what is the 

-- what is being addressed there? I thought it 

was the Board's -- whether the Board's remedial 

authority would be harmed, that that's why 

they're seeking a preliminary injunction. 

MS. BLATT: Yeah, and that just is 

empty words without saying what -- what in the 

harm is irreparable, why can't an order of 

reinstatement matter.  And the problem with the

MS. BLATT: -- by definition.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- but you -- you --

you've said that many times and you suggest that

 this is happening all the time.  There's record

 evidence that in the last year the Board has 

sought 14, 14, 1-4, 10(j) injunctions.  So it's 

not as though this is happening a lot. 

MS. BLATT: Well, totally fair, just 

when it happens, but in terms of the --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But what I'm 

saying is, if -- if we're -- if we're worried 

about an abusive Board doing things that it's 

not supposed to be, giving undue deference, it 

seems like the Board is pretty careful when it's 

determining whether or not to even seek these 

injunctions since it's only asked for it 14 

times. 

MS. BLATT: Well, I'd like to take 

that on because I do think that they are relying 

on the fact that they've done a fair 

investigation.  And no matter how much 

investigation and how much careful 

consideration, it's still a litigating position.

It's not the -- the fact finding, the 

adjudication that Congress assigned it.

 And second of all, the Board is asking 

for more deference to a litigation position than 

it would get at the back end. The Board could 

never get this kind of deference even if it had

 gone through the full adjudication.

 And, third, the Board can't have it

 both ways.  Either they're spending so much time 

investigating, maybe they should spend that time 

adjudicating so you don't need these year-long 

injunctions, or if they're saying, well, it 

takes so long for us to adjudicate, maybe 

because it's a hard question. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But I guess what I'm 

saying is they're only saying that in 14 cases. 

I mean, you're right, maybe -- maybe they should 

be going faster.  But they have only asked for 

this kind of injunction in a very, very small 

number of cases.  Twenty thousand complaints are 

filed with the Board.  Seven hundred result in 

Board action, and of those 700 that the Board is 

investigating and doing and determining, they've 

asked for this kind of injunction 14 times. 

So, I mean, I appreciate that maybe

 basis for deference.  And whether or not it's a

 huge problem, what Petitioner wants is just a

injunction, can -- can you please hold that the

irreparable harm part, you say in your reply

remedy the alleged unfair labor practices."  So 

you have no problem with that? 

MS. BLATT: Right, as long as it's --

it's actually irreparable, like there's some --

so let me just see if I can try to be -- you 

know, help here.  Chill can't be -- chill can be 

irreparable, but it has to be chilled from 

something that's about to happen, an event that 

can't be unscrambled.

remedial factors, it can't be faith in workplace

 actually, you know, barricaded the store and

 employees can't get into vote.  Unless we get 

this injunction, you can't recreate the

 conditions.  So that's all we're talking about.

 And, there, the Board's remedial power 

is being frustrated and there's irreparable

 harm, but all the more reason you've -- you 

know, balance of the equities, it may be that 

the employer had to shut down the store because 

it's not making money. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And on the equities 

and the public interest, I mean, I think also in 

your brief you acknowledge that when the -- the 

-- a statute like this is involved and public 

interests are involved, a court is supposed to 

take that into account in a way that's different 

from what it might in a statute between private 

parties -- excuse me, in a case between private 

parties with only private interests. 

MS. BLATT: I -- I think that's 

correct because, by definition, the public 

interest is broader than a breach of contract. 

And if you have, you know, the environment or --

interests, but the case that this originates and 

in the Oakland Cannabis and the Virginia

 Railway, it's public interest as deliberately

 expressed in legislation.  So where the Court 

has been on public interest is saying district 

courts can't reach out the confines of the 

statute either in going too far or too little.

 And that's -- that, I think, does go to public

 interest. 

But I do think our point is this 

public interest wasn't even referenced below, 

except for the district court saying there's a 

public interest in the statute, is that if 

there's not a showing under all three factors, 

the public interest is not served by, you know, 

putting a scarlet letter on an employer and 

having them just live under an injunction that 

they violated the act based on a non-frivolous 

legal theory, with not even their side of the 

evidence being heard.  That is very damaging to 

the public interest in my view.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  It's just that it 

requires more of a showing than the Sixth

 Circuit required here?

 MS. BLATT: Yeah.  So the Sixth

 Circuit three times said, you know, there's

 inherent chill, but they also pointed to 

evidence of chill. And all we're saying is 

evidence of chill needs to be tied to something 

that can't be undone, like the -- we -- we can't 

vote, now that we're chilled from voting, 

there's about to be a vote. 

The court said two things here in 

terms of chill.  They said no one was wearing 

union pins because they were scared, and, two, 

the terminated employees, although they're on 

the bargaining unit, it's not as convenient to 

talk to your -- the fellow employees if you're 

not on the shift. 

And those are harms, but they're not 

harms that are -- they're not the harms that are 

irreparable unless you're going to say anytime 

that you have a allegation there's fear of 

retaliation or an encumbrance, somehow that's

to, when -- whenever there's something against 

unionization effort, that's irreparable harm. 

But, yeah, I don't -- if I were you, I 

would leave this a very short opinion, but

please make clear --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But can I -- can --

MS. BLATT: -- that irreparable harm

 means irreparable.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can -- can I ask you 

about likelihood of success in this situation? 

I know others may have taken it off the table, 

but I'm a little curious as to why the district

 court would not at least have to put itself in 

the shoes of the Board when making this 

predictive judgment. 

I mean, this is why I said context 

matters in my view and that we're in the context 

of a statute in which Congress has given the 

Board the ability to determine the merits and --

at least in the first instance, and the ability 

to make the investigation, to find the facts. 

And in this context, that body has made a 

preliminary determination in these 14 cases that 

an injunction is warranted. 

So -- so is that relevant to the 

district court's determination, or it just comes 

in and handles this as though there was no Board 

or the Board is just one of the parties and it 

doesn't pay any attention --

 MS. BLATT: -- it's totally irrelevant

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Irrelevant or

 relevant?

 MS. BLATT: Totally irrelevant because 

the Board is a prosecuting party. It is a party 

that -- the NLRB is the general counsel. He's 

an adversary even before the Board. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But not according to 

the statute.  The statute -- it doesn't just 

relegate the Board to prosecuting party status. 

The statute says the Board is the one that's 

making the initial merits determination.  And 

so, when you're asking in the context of the 

preliminary injunction what is the likelihood of 

success on the merits, it doesn't seem to me to 

be irrelevant that the Board has determined 

based on its preliminary investigation that an 

injunction is warranted. 

MS. BLATT: Well, it's the general 

counsel, a separate authority under the statute.

 district courts --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, it's not that

 they've made up their mind.

 MS. BLATT: Well, they haven't.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  The question is --

the question is, given this unique statutory 

context in which we have the Board as a fact 

finder and a decisionmaker and also a 

prosecutor, as you've pointed out, right, that's 

what makes this context different than when we 

would ordinarily apply the four factors as a 

court. 

MS. BLATT: And all --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  We have an authority 

here that has made a preliminary determination 

that these facts are such that there's a 

likelihood of success on the merits.  So how can 

the district court ignore that? 

MS. BLATT: Because that, what you 

just said, basically sums to a litigation memo 

that a lawyer wrote to the Board and the Board 

signs off not in its capacity as a fact finder, 

but it's just authorizing litigation.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Is your point here 

that the litigating arm of the Board has brought

powers as the Board has not yet determined

 anything?

 MS. BLATT: And they better not have

 because then they're going to look biased.  But, 

more importantly, the -- the Board -- the -- the 

-- the litigating arm can file this injunction 

and then turn around and change his or her 

theory before the ALJ and the Board.  It's not 

certain --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I understand.  But 

we're talking about a prediction, and so I would 

think that the litigating arm of the Board would 

have a pretty good predictive capacity in terms 

of assessing what the Board might do in this 

case. 

MS. BLATT: Well --

know why that's irrelevant to a district court

MS. BLATT: Okay.  So, if you have a 

pure legal issue, this is completely irrelevant 

because who cares what a lawyer in NLRB thinks.

 I mean, they -- if there's a meaning of the 

statute, it just doesn't matter. In terms of 

this case, which is a question of

 burden-shifting in terms of what caused a 

termination, that is a mixed question of law and

 fact. And if it takes the Board two years to 

figure it out at the back end, it can't be that 

you would get deference when they haven't found 

any fact.  But I --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I suppose otherwise 

we -- a district court might take -- cognizance 

of the fact that agencies almost always win --

MS. BLATT: Well, that's what --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- before their --

MS. BLATT: -- I was going to say. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- their 

adjudicative bodies. 

MS. BLATT: If they have a 90 percent 

success rate, we'll always lose. I mean, 

really, that can predict -- and the Board tells 

courts this, you should know we're going to win 

because we always win. That's in their manual.

 four-part test.

 MS. BLATT: I think the government's 

view is we'll take the traditional test if you

 apply it untraditionally.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Consistent with the

 untraditional context in which we are operating?

 MS. BLATT: Yes, and all I'm trying to 

say is it's not that untraditional to have an 

administrative agency.  There's a lot of them in 

the federal government.  And the -- and the 

Congress authorizes injunctions a lot, and when 

it uses terms like "just and proper," Congress 

knows how to -- and we cite examples in our 

brief -- to give the agencies a leg up. It does 

that -- or at least in the trademark context. 

It does in another context where they'll presume 

irreparable harm.  I think, in the antitrust 

context, there's also special concerns.  So 

Congress knows how to do that. 

But the fact it went to the district 

court, which is completely outside the normal 

process of Board review, suggests that Congress 

expected district courts to do what they do all 

the time, and that is to apply -- to apply

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Isn't the history of

 this that Congress originally took the district 

courts completely out of it and that they just 

kind of brought them in in this one capacity?

 That's what I had understood.

 MS. BLATT: Yeah, that -- that's 

correct, that Norris-LaGuardia basically put a 

-- almost an absolute categorical ban on 

injunctions because courts were too aggressive 

in stopping unions.  And then it shifted in 1947 

pro-employers. So it's a little ironic that the 

government is relying on a statute that was 

supposed to help employers. 

But the district court is, you know, 

supposed to exercise the just and proper 

discretion.  Otherwise, it's banned under the 

stat -- Norris-LaGuardia from entering an 

injunction.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN RAYNOR

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. RAYNOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court: 

I think the question in this case has 

narrowed considerably, so I'll just walk through 

the factors. 

First, on irreparable harm, in its 

opening brief, Petitioner fought the idea that 

the irreparable harm inquiry should focus on 

whether the Board is going to be able to remedy 

the harm at the end of its proceedings.  At page 

2 of its reply, it now concedes the focus is on 

the Board's remedial power.  And I understood my 

friend to further concede that point in her 

argument this morning. 

Second, on harm, the question is not 

whether there is a certainty of harm.  The 

question is whether there's a likelihood of 

harm. The test used by the Sixth Circuit is

 reasonably necessary.  That's the Ahearn case.

 We think that's fully consistent with this

 Court's precedents. 

And as to whether all discharges 

count, we agree that not all unlawful discharges

 necessarily show irreparable harm.  The question 

that the Board looks at and the question that we

 think the Court should look at is whether that

 extinguishes the momentum of the union drive or 

impairs it in such a serious way that an order 

from the Board a year or two down the road won't 

be able to restart the drive. 

Second, on public interest and the 

equities, our basic point here is that when 

Congress makes a judgment about what is in the 

public interest, the court cannot override that 

judgment in weighing the equities at that stage. 

This is the Oakland Cannabis case.  The Court 

says, if Congress has made a judgment that 

something is unlawful, you can't basically make 

that thing lawful at the equities stage by 

refusing to enforce Congress's judgment. 

That doesn't mean that in some cases, 

at the preliminary stage, if there's extremely 

compelling interests on the other side or public

interests on the other side, that an injunction

 will automatically be necessary. But we think 

that in a case like this one, where Congress has

 made a judgment in -- in a run-of-the-mine case, 

there's only going to be purely private profit 

-- profit motive interests on the other side, 

injunctive relief is typically going to be

 warranted.  Again, I think Petitioner concedes 

this basic point at page 13 of its reply. It 

says that courts are not entitled to revise 

Congress's judgment. 

Third, that leaves the merits, which I 

think has been the subject of a lot of 

discussion this morning.  We think that the 

Court should take into account all relevant 

context. One piece of context is the statistics 

that Justice Jackson mentioned.  The Board 

receives 20,000 unfair labor charges every year. 

It issues 750 complaints.  Last year, it 

authorized 14 petitions and filed seven. That's 

seven out of 20,000. 

We think a court can properly take 

account of that in trying to make a predictive 

judgment about how the Board is going to come 

out. This ultimately is a predictive judgment.

How is the Board going to come out?  What is the

 likelihood of success before the Board?  And 

it's relevant that there is substantial 

winnowing that goes on before the complaint is

 filed in district court.

 I think it's also relevant to note 

that the Board has approved the Section 10(j) 

petition. And just to clarify the separation of 

functions within the agency here, the general 

counsel is the prosecutorial arm to the Board. 

The Board members themselves are the 

adjudicative authority. 

But the statute, Section 10(j) itself, 

vests in the Board the power to approve a 

Section 10(j) petition.  So, before a 10(j) 

petition is filed in court, the Board itself has 

approved it.  And that's relevant in making the 

predictive judgment about how this claim is 

likely to come out before the Board.  The 

adjudicator has already preliminarily signaled 

its view of the merits. 

That doesn't mean the Board has made 

up its mind.  It hasn't seen all the evidence. 

But that's a relevant consideration for the 

district court to think about in determining

brought the cream-of-the-crop cases before the 

Board -- this is -- before the court. This is

are the most deserving of relief.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't 

know why the inference --

MR. RAYNOR: -- highly selective.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know 

why the inference isn't the exact opposite, that

 these are the ones you really feel that you've

 got to put, you know, the -- the -- the best

 behind them because these are the ones that are 

going to end up in -- in court, the ones that 

are most vulnerable. 

MR. RAYNOR: But the function of the 

Section 10(j) petition, Mr. Chief Justice, is to 

preserve the Board's remedial authority.  So 

these are the cases where the Board is worried 

about irreparable harm accruing before the Board 

can issue its decision.

 adjudicative authority.

 And as Justice Jackson mentioned, the 

history here is that initially there was pretty

 widespread judicial intrusion into labor 

disputes, and in 1932, Congress cut that off and 

said we're not going to allow district courts to

 intervene.  And in 1935, it centralized 

adjudication of disputes in the Board.

 In 1947, it decided it had to walk 

back its restriction a little bit, and so it 

allowed Section 10(j) relief, but it didn't 

allow Section 10(j) relief for district courts 

to engage in a wide-ranging and intrusive 

involvement in labor disputes.  It allowed 

courts to come in basically as ancillary to the 

agency proceedings and protect the integrity of 

those proceedings. 

And in that context, I do think it is 

relevant that the Board is selective about the 

petitions that it files. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I appreciate 

that point, but would you agree that the 

likelihood of success on the merits inquiry

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  As opposed to other

 MR. RAYNOR: Correct.  It's a focus on

 this particular case.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It has to -- it has

 merits of this case, right? 

MR. RAYNOR: Correct. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And so the Sixth 

Circuit's rule that you can't engage in fact 

finding has to be wrong. 

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Gorsuch, we agree 

that some fact-finding is permissible.  And I 

think there's been a tendency to caricature what 

the Sixth Circuit is doing.  There was a two-day 

evidentiary hearing in this case and there was 

discovery. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, the Sixth 

Circuit said fact-finding is inappropriate. 

MR. RAYNOR: Correct.  It did -- it 

did say that. And I agree that language, if 

taken out of context --

just focusing on likelihood of the merits for a 

moment, we think that there has to be a 

substantial legal theory and that there has to 

be sufficient facts that a reasonable

 fact-finder could find for the Board. And we do

 think that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That doesn't sound

 like the -- yeah.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It doesn't sound 

like likelihood of success on the merits at all. 

MR. RAYNOR: It -- it -- it's -- it's 

likelihood of success of the merits in the sense 

that you're assessing how likely is the Board to 

succeed.  And we think they have to show a 

reasonable probability of success.  That's the 

standard that we think governs here.  And we 

think that's consistent with --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Not likelihood of 

success, reasonable?  What's reasonable?  What 

-- is that -- it's obviously -- is that above 

50 percent?  Is that 30 percent?

 MR. RAYNOR: I think it's consistent. 

For example, you know, Justice Kavanaugh, your

 opinion in Labrador says fair prospect.  I think

 that's generally along the lines of what we have

 in mind.  We don't think reasonable probability 

necessarily needs a percentage to spell it out.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, I'm sorry, are you 

saying it's the same or it's a lower bar than 

the usual likelihood of success standard as 

applied in courts every day under Winter? 

MR. RAYNOR: We think that it is a 

lower standard, principally for the -- the 

factual part which I mentioned, which is we 

think, if a reasonable fact-finder can find for 

the Board, that is sufficient. 

We do think that that's effectively 

the test that the Sixth Circuit has been 

applying.  I could point you to Ozburn-Hessey, 

which is a decision where the Sixth Circuit 

says, look, the Board has put in evidence that 

this --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is the reason for 

this lower standard only that the Board is, you 

know, generally restrained in asking for these

 along the lines that you said, or is there some 

other reason why we should apply -- why courts 

should apply a lower standard?

 MR. RAYNOR: I think it's a structural

 point, which is that Congress intended the Board

 to be the primary adjudicator here.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it did intend 

the Board to be the primary adjudicator, but it 

also gave this power over injunctions to the 

court. 

MR. RAYNOR:  Right.  And -- but we 

think that power has to be exercised cognizant 

of the fact that the Board is going to be 

adjudicating this dispute.  The court is not 

going to get out in front of the Board.  It's 

going to protect the Board's authority.  If you 

-- if you --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I don't see -- I 

don't see why that follows, because it's a 

preliminary analysis.  It's just a quick look. 

And what happens in the merits happens at the 

merits.  And in all sorts of alphabet soup 

agencies, we don't do this.  District courts 

apply the likelihood of success test as we 

normally conceive it.

So why is this particular statutory 

regime different than so many others that your

 friend points out?

 MR. RAYNOR: Well, Justice Gorsuch,

 with respect to the statutes that they identify,

 the case law in the lower courts does not

 uniformly support them.  It's actually quite

 mixed. There's a lot of it that supports our

 position.  In --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  There's a lot on the 

other side too. 

MR. RAYNOR: I acknowledge that it is. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  An awful lot.  And 

-- and I -- I just struggle to understand what 

you're asking lower courts to do and how it 

would be unique to the NLRB context as opposed 

to others, cognizant as well that these 

injunctions often run against employers and for 

the benefit of unions too, so whatever standard 

we come up with here, you know, goose and 

gander, or -- we have to be cognizant of that. 

MR. RAYNOR: I think, to the extent 

you adopt a standard in this case, its 

generalizability will actually be fairly 

limited.  There's only a handful of statutes

they identify that allow injunctive relief

 pending administrative proceedings.  There's

 three in particular:  The FTC, the EEOC, the

 Department of Labor.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right.

 MR. RAYNOR: But other statutes, for

 example, simply involving the federal

 government, the authority to sue to enforce 

federal law, we don't think it would generalize 

because there's not the structural concerns I 

raised with Justice Kagan. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Raynor, is that 

because what we're talking about here is a 

predictive judgment related to what the Board is 

likely to find, that -- that there are 

predictive judgments or there's the preliminary 

relief determination that courts are used to 

making, which is who's going to win, you know, 

from my perspective as between the parties that 

are before me, right? 

Someone's brought a complaint. 

Someone is defending.  I'm looking at this 

preliminarily and making a judgment as to who's 

likely to win on the merits of the legal issue 

that they have brought.

That's the ordinary course of things.

 I think -- and maybe I'm wrong and you can --

that -- that the predictive judgment here is not

 that.

 The predictive judgment here is the 

Board is seeking injunctive relief to protect 

its remedial authority and what -- to the extent

 we're applying the four factors, it's the 

likelihood that the Board is going to decide 

that there is an unfair labor practice in this 

situation and reverse the stakes on the ground 

or whatever.  Is -- is -- is that right? 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes, I do think that's 

correct.  The Board is the principal adjudicator 

here. We're trying to predict how they're going 

to come out. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I don't --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: They're not the 

final --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- see how that could 

possibly be, Mr. Raynor, that, you know, a court 

is supposed to say, well, I have one view of the 

law, but I'm just going to assume that the Board

MR. RAYNOR: Well, I took the premise

 of Justice Jackson's question to be, for 

example, if there's NLRB precedent that the

 Court hasn't weighed in on yet.  We -- but we 

know that precedent is going to apply before the 

Board. It would have to think about the fact 

that that precedent --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, sure, if there's 

NLRB precedent, that -- you know, that's the 

reigning -- that's the governing law, the court 

is supposed to think about that. 

MR. RAYNOR: Correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because that's the 

governing law. 

MR. RAYNOR: Correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's just supposed 

to think about that as a court doing what courts 

normally do, which is applying the law as the

exactly the same way in this case that it does 

in others, I still would submit that it would be 

easier for the Board to satisfy that test, 

principally because, as I mentioned earlier, the

 Board has already approved the petition.  It has

 signaled its preliminary view of the merits.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But that means we're 

giving the Board a boost because of the 

screening function that it's engaged in and 

we're saying, well, you know, the Board clearly 

thought it was meritorious when it had its 

prosecutorial hat on, so we should assume that 

when the Board has its adjudicatory hat on, that 

it's going to rule in favor of itself. 

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Barrett, I 

acknowledge that the Board could change its mind 

once it has all the evidence before it. It 

doesn't have the evidence before it, the ALJ 

hearing evidence, for example, at the time it 

approves the petition. 

But I would dispute the notion that 

it's acting in a prosecutorial role at this 

stage. It's approving the petition -- the 10(j) 

petition to protect its adjudicative authority. 

And Congress hasn't given it -- for example, the

way that district courts have the authority to

 issue a PI to protect their own authority,

 Congress hasn't given that to the Board and said 

you have to ask the district court.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Because the district

 court is an independent check, right?  Because

 this is a big deal --

MR. RAYNOR: Correct.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- to have the 

injunction in place no matter who it enjoins. 

So the district court is an independent check, 

so it seems like it should be just doing what 

district courts do since it was given the 

authority to do it. 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes.  We -- we 

acknowledge this isn't a rubber stamp, and I 

think the success statistics in the various 

circuits bear that out.  And we do think that 

there has to be an inquiry into the merits. 

Ozburn-Hessey, again, is an example where the 

Court said the evidence is over -- overwhelming 

against the Board.  We're not going to blind 

ourselves to that.  We're not going to grant 

relief here.

 check. The only question is what -- to what

 extent it should be a check.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let me -- let me see 

if I can put it this way. So the district 

court's supposed to ask likelihood of success on 

the merits. Is it supposed to ask what I think

 are the likelihood of success on the merits 

objectively as best I can come up with, as 

neutral a judgment as I can muster?  Or is it 

supposed to ask, well, I don't think you're 

likely to succeed, but I think the Board will? 

Is that what -- is that -- is that --

that seems to me the delta between the positions 

here. And, you know, I -- I -- gosh, I -- it's 

clear to me that your -- you know, your -- your 

friend's going to win, but the Board's going to 

rule otherwise.  Is -- is that -- you know, is 

that really supposed to be what a district judge 

is supposed to do? 

MR. RAYNOR: Well, Justice Gorsuch, 

I'm not sure, I guess, in the hypothetical what 

would be the basis for the discrepancy.

the fact that boards tend to win in front of 

boards. They sometimes lose in later review, 

but they win at least in front of the board.

 And I guess, if we're going to take 

account of statistics, why not also ask how

 often the NLRB gets reversed?  You know, I mean,

 where -- where does it end? And -- and why, 

again, shouldn't a district judge just ask, as

 best they can muster, with relevant NLRB 

precedent in mind, all of the law, all of the 

facts? And it may have different facts before 

it too than -- than the Board did when it 

authorized the 10(j).  It's going to hold a

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Thank you.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why -- so why do 

you think it's a lower standard?

 MR. RAYNOR: Justice Jackson, again, I 

think it's a couple things, but it's principally

 structural.  We think the Board is -- is the 

adjudicator here. The role of the district 

court is -- to protect and facilitate the 

Board's adjudication --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And that's in the 

statute from your view -- it's not your view of 

just sort of how it should be? 

MR. RAYNOR: Correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  You -- you see --

you read the statute as set -- as setting up 

this structure? 

MR. RAYNOR: Yes, exactly.  This --

this is the function of a Section 10(j) 

petition.  The board -- the 10(j) petition 

expires when the Board issues its order.  At 

that point, there's a different statutory 

authority that allows the Board to enforce its 

order in court.  And so all we're talking about

is a petition that's specifically designed to 

protect the Board's adjudication.

 And, again, the historical record 

supports this in the sense that Congress didn't

 want wide-ranging district court involvement in

 labor disputes.  It wanted to give a limited 

district court authority to protect the Board's

 adjudicative authority.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why do you think 

Congress did that? 

MR. RAYNOR: I think the reason is 

that in 1932, when it passed the 

Norris-LaGuardia Act, it imposed very stringent 

restrictions on district court ability to issue 

injunctions.  And in the post-war period, there 

was essentially a lot of labor unrest that 

courts weren't able to step in expeditiously and 

stop. And the court thought that was necessary. 

And so, if you look at the legislative history, 

Congress says, look, it sometimes takes the 

Board a while to rule and there might be a lot 

of harm inflicted in the meantime, so we need to 

give district courts the authority to prevent 

that harm while Board proceedings are ongoing.

full considerations of equity brought to bear

 rather than a looser standard that's -- results

 in more judicial interference in labor affairs.

 MR. RAYNOR: I -- I recognize that 

that's one way to think about it, but our view 

is that ours is actually a more modest

 conception of the judicial role, which is that

 it's protecting the Board's adjudicative

 authority rather than engaging in its own 

free-ranging exploration of the merits. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  In this context, 

consistent with the kind of injunction that 

we're talking about here, it's not sort of 

protecting the parties in general; it's 

protecting this particular interest, which is 

the Board's authority? 

MR. RAYNOR: Exactly.  And there's 

public -- we are not suing on behalf of any 

private parties.  The Board is suing to protect 

public rights only.  And we do think, to the 

extent this is generalizable, it's actually a 

relatively limited set of statutes to which our 

rule here would apply. 

If the Court has no further questions?

rule.

example, the government simply has the ability

 May. Exceptions have been filed.  How -- how 

long is this going to take? 

MR. RAYNOR: The -- the statistics are 

that, typically, from complaint to final Board 

order is about two -- two years. It varies 

somewhat every fiscal year, but about two years. 

So we're coming up on when you might expect the 

Board to rule on that basis. 

The -- the complaint --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the injunction 

lasts until then or lasts until what? 

MR. RAYNOR: It lasts until the Board 

issues its order.  At that point, there's a

Board can go get preliminary relief --

I'm not privy to what the Board's timing will

if the Board were to rule before this Court were

 of mootness because the petition would expire --

the injunction would expire by its own terms.

that's pretty much not at issue now and that the 

real question in dispute is whether the

 likelihood of success inquiry is ratcheted down

 somewhat.

 Is that what you understand the only

 issue in dispute to be?

 MR. RAYNOR: I think so, Justice 

Kagan, assuming that the way we understand 

irreparable harm is that it focuses on the 

Board's remedial authority and there only has to 

be a reasonably likely showing of irreparable 

harm. And then, on the public interest, our 

view is simply that Congress has said what the 

public interest here is.  If you think there's 

been a likelihood of success on the violation, 

however you want to define that, by the time we 

get to public interest and weighing of the 

equities, it's going to have to be a pretty 

compelling private interest on the other side to 

overcome Congress's judgment that this kind of 

conduct should be illegal. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And then, with respect 

to the likelihood of success, you're not arguing 

as I understand it that somehow the Court is 

supposed to say, well, let's pretend I'm not a

court is supposed to do what a court does.

 Is that correct?

 MR. RAYNOR: Yes, Justice Kagan.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Look at the law and

 make the best decision on the law.

 Now you have a different standard that 

you think that the court ought to apply when the 

court looks at the law and makes the best 

decision on the law, and I understand that 

difference, but this isn't something where 

you're saying, like, the court is supposed to 

pretend to be the Board? 

MR. RAYNOR: Justice Kagan, I think 

that's generally correct with a caveat we do 

think it's relevant that the Board has approved 

the petition. And we do think, in circumstances 

where there may be a law or a rule that applies 

to the Board but not to the district court, the 

district court would have to take that into 

account, for example, NLRB precedent.

 preliminary injunction.  So it -- it doesn't 

have reference to another actor that may or may

 not have approved preliminary relief.

 In this case, we know the Board is the

 ultimate adjudicator, and we know that it has 

signaled its preliminary view of the merits by

 approving the petition.  That type of structural 

relationship isn't present when the district

 court is issuing the preliminary injunction 

without regard to an agency request. 

I don't want to overstate this point. 

As I've mentioned, the Board can change its mind 

once it hears the evidence.  It hasn't 

prejudged, but we do think this is relevant to 

the predictive inquiry about how this case is 

going to come out, what the likelihood of

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. BLATT: Thank you. May it please

 the Court:

 Just a couple things.  On page 91 of 

the district court, the district court said, in 

terms of likelihood of success, my next inquiry 

focuses on whether there are any facts

 supporting each allegation without resolving 

conflicting evidence.  So there's no question 

there was none of that. 

And in terms of the standard that as 

long reasonable facts support the Board's theory 

that should be enough, if that sounds familiar, 

it's because it's the standard for summary 

judgment, and that obviously is not the standard 

for an injunction. 

And it's a little bit ironic that 

that's the standard from summary judgment 

because, if you can survive summary judgment, at 

least we get a trial.  So this is even worse 

than a party would have at summary judgment. So 

they should have to prove their case like any 

other party. 

In terms of -- so the likelihood of

 success, just another thing to keep in mind, the

 only evidence that the district court is going 

to have is the evidence before the district

 court.

 In terms of the legal theory, the --

the Board has been very, very aggressive on some 

of its legal theories, including in a case where 

Starbucks sought discovery, the Board turned

 around and called that an unfair labor practice 

and then told the district court they had to 

defer to it. 

The Board also says that you have to 

bargain with unions that have been decertified. 

So these are very serious legal questions that 

do come up. 

And the other thing, if they want 

deference on to their -- their investigative 

decision, then why aren't they producing their 

litigation memo?  I mean, really.  If they --

that's what you're supposed to do when you get 

deference is show your work. 

And this is obviously a privileged 

document and their manual is a cookie-cutter 

thing saying here's how you get your litigation 

memo, here's how you get Board approval.  So at

 least disclose it.

 In terms of getting out in front, 

obviously, the district court's findings aren't

 binding on the ALJ or the Board.

 And in terms of lower courts, the only 

thing I'll add is that almost all the cases that 

kind of water down the standard are pre-Winter.

 There was one post-Winter case that didn't cite

 Winter, and then the Ninth Circuit, the 

government relied on and cited the court said 

this is in tension with Winter. 

We'd ask that the judgment be 

reversed. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.  The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:31 p.m., the case 

was submitted.)
