 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument next in Case 22-666, Wilkinson versus

 Garland.

 Ms. Santos.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAIME A. SANTOS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SANTOS: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Non-citizens who have lived here for 

10 years, have good moral character and a clean 

record, can seek immigration relief if their 

removal will cause exceptional and extremely 

unusual hardship to a U.S. family member.  If 

the agency concludes that the facts don't 

satisfy that standard, the question here is 

whether courts have the power to review that 

decision. 

They do. The INA limits review of 

denials of discretionary relief, but it permits 

review of questions of law.  And as this Court 

held in Guerrero-Lasprilla, the statutory term 

"questions of law" includes the application of 

legal standards to settled facts.  Even the

 Board agrees that exceptional and extremely

 unusual hardship is a legal standard.  So, under

 Guerrero-Lasprilla, the agency's application of

 that standard is reviewable.

 The government argues that 

Guerrero-Lasprilla's holding applies only to 

common law standards and offers a different test

 for statutory standards.  And while 

jurisdictional tests are supposed to be simple, 

the government's fashioned an elaborate and 

amorphous framework that won't provide clear 

answers. 

First, courts should see whether the 

standard has a common law origin.  If so, the 

government suggests it's probably reviewable but 

doesn't commit either way. 

Next, courts should scour current and 

prior versions of the statute for any hint that 

Congress wanted the agency to have discretion, 

even if it later deleted the 

discretion-conferring language. 

If that doesn't somehow answer the 

question, courts should ask whether the standard 

requires evaluation and fact-weighing.  They 

should then traipse through any version of the

U.S. Code that -- that has ever existed looking 

for similarly worded standards and see if courts

 have ever labeled those discretionary.

 Taking these factors together, courts 

can then deem the standard a discretionary

 one -- a reviewable mixed question or an 

unreviewable discretionary one. It would be bad

 enough if the government were urging this test 

only for cancellation, but courts would have to 

apply it to dozens of INA standards, including 

whether a non-citizen has been rehabilitated, 

subjected to extreme cruelty, or violated the 

terms of a visa.  I tried making a complete list 

last week and stopped count at 75.  In other 

words, the government's test promises a 

never-ending supply of judicial review cases for 

this Court's merits docket. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  We're allowed to 

certainly review questions of law, and, of 

course, the Court said that includes mixed 

questions of law.  But, in -- in -- in some of 

these cases, if we're looking at fact-finding, I 

think we agree that's not reviewable.  On the 

other hand, if we're looking at legal standards,

that is reviewable as they're applied to these

 facts.

 How does that work in your case?  I

 didn't understand it -- how it was work in

 some -- worked -- how it would work in some of 

the earlier cases. But if you could walk 

through how it would work here, how we would 

separate a review of a legal standard from a

 review of the facts in a case involving mixed 

questions of fact and law. 

MS. SANTOS: Happy to walk you through 

that, Your Honor.  So, here, we don't think that 

the -- the question of whether something is a 

challenge to a fact finding would really come up 

because the immigration judge credited all of 

the testimony and evidence that Mr. Wilkinson 

provided. 

But, in a typic -- typical case, what 

would happen is a court would open up the blue 

brief, see if there are any challenges to 

findings of fact made by the IJ, and, if so, the 

court wouldn't review any of those.  And if the 

only challenge is to the IJ's or the BIA's 

ultimate determination that the standard wasn't 

satisfied, that would be reviewable.

So, here, for example, Your Honor, our

 submission before the Third Circuit on remand 

would be that while the IJ credited all of the

 facts and evidence and while the IJ recited the

 right legal standard in a -- in a boilerplate 

section of its decision, it then, when applying

 the standard, disregarded all of the facts and 

factors that render this case exceptional and

 extremely unusual. 

And I would point to, for example, the 

fact that Mr. Wilkinson's son, M, has a serious 

medical condition that places him in the 

hospital with some frequency, that his mother 

has depression that renders her unable to care 

for M for days a time, that M has learning and 

behavioral challenges that have been exacerbated 

by Mr. Wilkinson's detention, and -- and that 

Mr. Wilkinson is not only the sole financial 

provider for M but also has -- is his only male 

role model and has been a consistent support 

emotionally and a physical presence in his life.

you tell us how many people have a similar list 

of hardships in the whole group of people who 

are subject to the same immigration laws as this

 individual was? 

MS. SANTOS: I cannot, Your Honor.  I

 think, in the immigration context, as in many

 contexts, there will be a lot of different facts

 that will be case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

-- the statutory standard is exceptional and 

extremely unusual, not burdensome, not 

difficult, not very unfortunate.  Unusual, which 

requires a comparative analysis. 

And I don't see how doing the best you 

can to determine what that number is and given 

the size of it, I don't -- maybe it's 3 percent 

of the whole population, maybe it's 20,000 

people -- it seems to me that that -- it's hard 

to determine whether something's extremely and 

exceptionally unusual other than -- I mean, it's 

not a purely factual question. 

The government talks a lot about 

discretion in determining what weight should be 

given the factors you mentioned compared to 

other determinations.  Maybe somebody has a

difficulties that they have encountered are as 

-- as challenging as the ones here.  But which

 one do you categorize as -- does that make them

 both unusual?

 MS. SANTOS: Well, Your Honor, we

 think that all of the -- the -- the points that 

you just raised, the fact that IJs see more of 

these cases, have more experience, all of that 

would probably cash out in the standard-of-

review analysis.  But it -- it just -- those 

types of practical considerations don't have 

anything to do with whether they are -- whether 

the -- the determinations are reviewable at all. 

And I think that what courts would do 

when reviewing these types of determinations is 

something similar to what the -- what the Board 

does. It -- it would interpret the language. 

It might note, for example, that exceptional and 

extremely unusual hardship is a different 

standard than extreme hardship, which appears 

elsewhere in the statute.  So it would look to 

text, it would look to precedent, it would look 

to ordinary dictionary definitions.  And -- and 

that's exactly what the Board did --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- putting 

that aside, let's say they come up with a

 particular number.  I mean, what percent of

 people with the same sort of challenging

 circumstances that you mentioned or similar --

 substantially similar ones are -- are there?  Is

 it 1 percent?  Is it 2 percent?  And what 

constitutes extremely and exceptionally unusual? 

Those -- those are judgments that call for a 

high degree of discretion on the part of the 

immigration judges. 

MS. SANTOS: Well, I -- I agree with 

Your Honor that -- that they require a -- a -- a 

degree of judgment and experience and common 

sense. But the standard does -- does not ask 

for a quantitative assessment.  The standard, as 

interpreted in Monreal-Aguinaga, says that you 

-- the -- the hardship doesn't need to be 

overwhelming; it has to be substantially greater 

than is kind of incident to a -- a -- a family 

member leaving the country. 

And so -- so those types of judgments 

might warrant a more deferential review.  But it

of discretion, and so --

MS. SANTOS: So I am -- I am not going

 to push back on the fact that I -- I'm virtually 

certain it would be deferential. I think that

 virtually every court on our side of the split 

has agreed that it would be a -- a deferential 

standard of review, and I think all of those 

practical considerations go to that point.

 But one thing that I think is 

critically important is that those practical 

considerations the Court said expressly in 

Guerrero-Lasprilla may be relevant to standard 

of review, but they're not relevant to whether 

there's judicial review at all. 

And I think the reason for that is 

important.  That's because standard of review 

and reviewability have just totally different 

frameworks.  Reviewability looks at -- it's just 

purely an exercise in statutory construction. 

So you're looking at the canons of statutory 

interpretation. 

But, when you're looking at standard 

of review, you use different decision-making 

criteria.  So you'll look at for one thing is 

there a long and a consistent history of 

appellate practice.  And then you'll look at the

giving more deference to one decision-maker or

 the other.  But that just doesn't enter into the

 framework for looking at judicial review.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But don't we have a

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Would you concede --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But another way to

 think about the Chief Justice's question is to 

say that what he was talking about really does 

go to whether it's a legal question at all, 

including a mixed question, because, in a 

typical mixed question, you know, you look at 

the law and you look at the facts and then you 

look at the law again and you see how it all 

matches up. 

But, in this question, you're not 

really looking at the law at all.  I mean, you 

sort of say, okay, it says unusual and 

exceptional, but the -- the essential project is 

to look at one factual situation and compare it 

with many other factual situations. 

And so, when you think of the 

essential project as that, it starts looking not 

like a legal question at all, not just -- so

separate out there are lots of legal questions 

that involve judgment and gray areas and all of 

that, but this, because of what it tells you to 

look at, which is compare this factual situation 

to many others you've seen, you -- you have --

where is the law in that?

 MS. SANTOS: Well, Your Honor, I would 

make two points to that. The first point is 

that I think that that was essentially the 

government's exact argument in 

Guerrero-Lasprilla, that due diligence 

determinations involve essentially no legal work 

and it's just the application of the standard to 

facts, and yet this Court still held that 

constitutes a question of law. 

And I think it's because -- I think 

you might be getting caught a little -- caught 

up a little bit in the kind of colloquial use of 

the term "question of law."  That term is kind 

of thrown out in -- in different contexts and 

used in different ways. But, here, we're 

talking about the specific statutory term that 

this Court interpreted to include the 

application of law to fact or a mixed question. 

Mixed questions are sometimes reviewed

de novo, they're sometimes reviewed for clear 

error, they're sometimes reviewed for abuse of

 discretion, but they're still all mixed

 questions.

 And I think that comparative analysis

 that Your Honor points to is very similar to

 extraordinary circumstances determinations under 

-- for untimely asylum petitions and due

 diligence.  I think it's also similar to 

exceptional case determinations under the Patent 

Act and the Lanham Act.  But that doesn't make 

it not a mixed question and it doesn't make it

still a statutory term that Congress chose,

 right? So this is the standard that Congress 

set. So I think you'd still have to determine

 what Congress was intending to -- what -- what 

Congress meant when it -- when it used these

 specific terms.  So that's still --

JUSTICE ALITO:  It meant what the

 terms mean.  These are ordinary terms.  You can 

look them up in a dictionary. 

MS. SANTOS: And that is --

JUSTICE ALITO:  People don't even need

MS. SANTOS: And -- and -- and that's 

essentially what the Court said in -- in other 

cases involving similar kind of common ordinary 

meaning terms like "exceptional case 

determinations" or -- or even "undue hardship" 

under Title VII, but it's still a -- an 

exercise -- still a legal exercise to apply that 

standard to the facts as found by the IJ. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But is it the type 

of legal exercise that Congress was intending?

comparison of these facts to other facts, I

 guess my question is, when we look at Congress's 

intent in this area, you know, it -- it's about

 the division of labor and to what extent did

 Congress intend for the court to be the one to

 make -- make that comparison.  On what basis

 could the court be making that comparison?

 And can't we say, given the clear

 jurisdiction-stripping provisions as later 

interpreted by Patel, that really Congress 

wanted the agency to be the one to do that kind 

of comparison and not the court? 

MS. SANTOS: No, Your Honor, we can't, 

and I'll -- I'll explain why, and it has to do 

with the way that the -- structure of the 

statute works. 

So every single determination in the 

INA that is specified as being discretionary, it 

all falls within the scope of Section 

1252(a)(2)(B).  So that's the 

jurisdiction-stripping provision. 

But what subparagraph (D) -- that's 

the limited review provision -- does is it 

trumps that designation.  So it says nothing in 

subparagraph (B) or (C) or any other provision

of -- of this chapter shall be construed to 

preclude judicial review of questions of law.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  I appreciate that.

 But I understood that the enactment history was 

such that Congress put that in in response to 

St. Cyr and the concern that if it did what it 

wanted to do, which was get the judiciary out of 

this and give it to the agency, that there might

 be constitutional problems. 

And so Congress puts in this 

additional language that you're talking about 

but only to the extent that we have a 

constitutional question or -- and I take your 

point that it says questions of law, and we, you 

know, suggested in or held in a subsequent 

opinion that that includes mixed questions --

but, if we read mixed questions to be so broad 

that it is essentially, you know, supplanting 

the agency's decision-making, I find it hard to 

make the statute make sense. 

MS. SANTOS: Well, I think you can 

look to what the Court said in both 

Guerrero-Lasprilla and Patel about what would 

remain unreviewable after you apply the limited 

review provision and layer it on top of

 And what the Court said in

 Guerrero-Lasprilla is that the -- the limited 

review provision would still forbid appeals of

 findings of fact.  And in Patel, the Court said

 the same thing.  If we apply both statutes

 together, the -- major remaining category of 

determinations that are unreviewable are factual

 findings.  There was just no --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I understand, but 

why would the -- why would Congress want it to 

be that way in the statute?  Why would it have a 

statute that has the agency making the factual 

determinations and the ultimate cancellation 

decision, but the court swoops in to just 

review, you know, the agency's actual function 

with respect to determining eligibility? 

MS. SANTOS: I think for a few 

reasons, Your Honor.  Number one is, by doing 

so, the -- the -- by -- by enacting the limited 

review provision the way it did, it still cut 

out any judicial review of findings of fact, 

which, in many cases, in many cancellation 

cases, will completely control the -- the 

conclusion.  You won't always have cases like

 testimony and evidence that the non-citizen

 provided.

 And I think the second reason is that

 by -- by enacting that provision, it got rid of

 an entire layer of habeas review.  So district 

court habeas proceedings are still completely

 unavailable.

 But the typical role of an appellate 

court to -- to review that application of the 

legal standard to facts, whether under a 

deferential standard or not, would still be 

maintained.

Wouldn't you say -- and I guess I'd 

push back a little bit on your characterization 

of Wilkinson's claims in particular below as

 being of that variety because, you know, I

 looked at the record.

 His claims, you know, the immigration

 judge, he claimed that the immigration judge 

wrongly speculated about the care and support 

the child would receive if the Petitioner was 

removed.  They all read like weighing ones. 

He found, while Wilkinson does provide 

emotional support, removing him would result in 

minimal emotional hardship because his son 

clearly has lived without Wilkinson's daily 

presence for most of his life because the mother 

had primary custody. 

So doesn't it seem like you're just 

seeking or that your client was seeking a 

reweighing of those facts and so that under 

Patel, they really would be not subject to 

review? 

MS. SANTOS: So all -- the -- the 

specific factual points that you pointed to, I 

agree with you.  Those would be unreviewable.

MS. SANTOS: But what would be 

reviewable is the ultimate determination of 

whether that satisfies the statutory standard.

 And it -- it -- it is often the case, for

 example, that -- that -- that, you know, when --

when you're challenging -- potentially

 challenging the weighing of -- of various 

factors and facts, an agency or -- or a court of 

appeals can't just supplant its view of the --

of the evidence for that of the agency.  But, 

still, the ultimate question of whether those 

facts satisfy the standard remain a question of 

law. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it seems to me 

-- I mean, I've looked at some of these cases 

and the Sixth Circuit sides with you -- but, 

when it reviews these cases, it says that a lot 

of these claims about, well, you just didn't 

understand the strength of the emotional bond or 

you didn't accurately predict what life would be 

like for my child if I were deported or -- or 

removed or my spouse, what the court says is 

those kinds of things are factual.

 flowing from Guerrero-Lasprilla, it's hard for

 me to see looking at these cases very many that 

aren't essentially factual challenges.

 MS. SANTOS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I 

agree with you that all of those things you just 

pointed to, that you cited from the Sixth

 Circuit cases, those are unreviewable.  And --

and kind of weeding out unreviewable findings

 and fact are -- are things that appellate courts 

do all the time. They have to do so in every 

interlocutory appeal of a qualified immunity 

decision.

then that there would probably be only a very

favor would make judicially reviewable and

MS. SANTOS: I -- I think it depends 

on what the Board does in any given case.  I 

agree with Your Honor that if the IJ makes 

adverse factual findings or if all the non- --

non-citizen is doing is challenging factual 

findings on appeal, those won't be viable 

claims.  But what would be reviewable is the --

 those facts satisfy the standard.

 And, here, I'll just point out 

briefly, Your Honor, that I think the Third

 Circuit clearly understood Mr. Wilkinson's 

challenge as being one to that mixed question

 because it said -- and you can see this on page

 3a of the petition appendix -- that Mr.

 Wilkinson argues that the hardship his son faces

 is indeed exceptional, that's not reviewable 

because it's discretionary.  The court did not 

say Mr. Wilkinson is challenging findings of 

fact, and under Patel, those findings of fact 

are unreviewable. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you agree that 

credibility determinations are factual for these 

purposes and, therefore, unreviewable? 

MS. SANTOS: Yes, Your Honor.  We 

don't think that credibility determinations 

present mixed questions of law and fact, and 

that's because -- and just to kind of make sure 

we're all on the same page, the -- the statute 

that the government points to is one that says, 

considering the totality of the circumstances 

and all relevant factors, the finder of fact 

when determining credibility can consider -- and

 That doesn't fall within the

 definition of a mixed question.  A mixed 

question involves applying a standard to

 undisputed or settled facts and -- and 

determining whether the standard is satisfied.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, here, the 

BIA doesn't review the IJ's findings on -- on

 this being an exceptional case with deference. 

It reviews it de novo. So the BIA believes 

there's a legal standard, correct? 

MS. SANTOS: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

And, in fact, when EOIR promulgated clear error 

review for the first time in 2002, it actually 

used exceptional and extremely unusual hardship 

as an example of something that wouldn't be 

reviewed for clear error because it's not a 

factual finding.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- can I just ask,

 though, whether Guerrero-Lasprilla is helping us 

with a particular nuance that I see happening,

 right? We've said in other scenarios that not 

all mixed questions are the same. So, even if 

we assume that Guerrero, as I'll call it, says

 mixed questions count for questions of law, is 

it possible that there are certain kinds of

 mixed questions that Congress intended to 

include here and other kinds that it didn't? 

So my example is a scenario in which 

the defendant or the -- the petitioner is 

challenging the BIA's own rules with respect to 

how it applies this extreme and unusual 

hardship.  So you say in your brief the BIA has 

looked at the statute and it has come up with 

factors that it says the IJ should be applying 

when it does this. If someone makes the claim 

that the BIA's factors are inconsistent with the 

statute insofar as they're applying it in this 

way in this case, I guess you could say that's a 

mixed question perhaps.  Maybe it's closer to 

the -- the question -- a pure question of law, 

but at least you're -- you're challenging the 

BIA's interpretation of the statute with respect

to the factors that it has created.

 Justice Barrett has come up with a

 different kind of scenario where we agree on the

 facts of this case and we agree on the 

standards, the factors, that everybody's saying,

 hooray, BA -- BIA, you have it right with 

respect to what the IJ is supposed to be looking 

at, but the claim is that the IJ has not weighed

 these factors appropriately, that it has put 

more stock in a certain, you know, segment of it 

than another, and, the Court, we really think 

you should reweigh it differently. 

Now that might be a mixed question 

too, but it seems to me that it's of a different 

variety.  And if we could interpret Guerrera --

Guerrero to be talking about the former and not 

the latter, maybe it doesn't have to be 

overruled. 

MS. SANTOS: So I don't think there's 

any way to principally read Guerrero-Lasprilla 

that way. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mm-hmm.

two reasons.  Number one is because of the way 

that the case was litigated.  The government's

 Guerrero-Lasprilla was that, for -- first, no

 mixed question should be considered questions of

 law.

 Justice?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MS. SANTOS: And, second, that at the

 very least, super fact questions shouldn't be 

considered questions of law, and the Court 

rejected that, and in doing so, its opinion did 

not distinguish any particular mixed questions. 

And it drew from a variety of contexts, 

including constitutional mixed questions, 

statutory mixed questions, and common law mixed 

questions.

 perhaps a question of law?

 MS. SANTOS: Your Honor, I believe

 that the -- that the application of any statute 

-- any legal standard to facts qualifies as a

 mixed question.  It may sometimes be driven by a 

particular factual finding, but the application

 of law to fact, I think, is. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- and that's what 

every judgment does, right?  It applies the law 

to a particular set of facts. 

MS. SANTOS: It -- I guess it depends 

on the way you -- you -- what you mean by the 

term "judgment," which I know is a whole issue 

in Patel, and I don't want to get caught up in 

that, but -- but, yes, I think that any 

conclusion about whether a statutory standard is 

satisfied is the application of law to fact, and 

that presents a mixed question. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And 1252(a)(2) 

precludes reviewing judgments, so your argument 

is that although it precludes reviewing 

judgments, in fact, every judgment is reviewable 

because it's a mixed question of law and fact?

MS. SANTOS: Well, Your Honor, our 

position is that 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) precludes 

judicial review over any judgment regarding the 

granting of relief, but if you look up two

 lines, it says except as provided in 

subparagraph (D), and if you look down a couple 

paragraphs, it says nothing in subparagraph (B)

 shall be construed as precluding review of -- of

 questions of law. 

So, yes, I think that the plain text 

of subparagraph (D) trumps a designation of --

of a -- of a judgment as discretionary --

JUSTICE ALITO:  It swallows up the 

exception completely. 

MS. SANTOS: It -- it doesn't, Your 

Honor, because it still precludes the judicial 

review of questions of fact, as this Court said 

in Guerrero-Lasprilla and Patel, and it 

precludes any -- any first-line habeas review, 

any habeas review at -- at all, which removed an 

entire layer of judicial review.

 Alito has made, and that was one of his

 criticisms of the majority opinion, wasn't it?

 MS. SANTOS: It -- it was.  It was

 that the -- the -- the majority opinion was 

categorical when it could have been narrow.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I think 

Justice Thomas pointed out what Justice Jackson 

noted, that there are different kinds of mixed

 questions of law and fact and that the majority 

had ruled those -- that out as a reason. 

MS. SANTOS: That's right, Your Honor. 

I also think even beyond -- I mean, I know that 

sometimes dissents are written broadly, but I do 

think that's an accurate categorization or -- or 

-- or characterization of what the majority 

decided. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? 

Justice Gorsuch? 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Can we agree that 

the ultimate discretionary decision rests with 

the Attorney General and is unreviewable too? 

MS. SANTOS: It's unreviewable as a 

question of law, absolutely, because it doesn't 

involve the application of law to fact. It 

still would be subject -- subjected to

 MS. SANTOS: -- that may exist.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sure.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  In response to

 Justice Jackson, when you said Guerrero rejected 

that kind of line-splitting of a mixed question 

from more factual mixed questions, one of the 

reasons we did that, I think, is because there 

would be, as your brief says, a morass trying to 

do that across the board and it would be years, 

if not decades, of litigation trying to resolve 

that question when, if you just do a deferential 

standard of review, you know, the -- the Board's 

going to get affirmed most of the time but not 

always but most of the time and you don't have 

this collateral litigation. 

MS. SANTOS: Yes, that's right, Your 

Honor. And -- and I think that pushing --

pushing this into the merits bucket doesn't mean 

that -- that we're just kind of repeating the 

same analysis.

I think standard-of-review analysis is

 actually way simpler than the government's

 framework.  And, also, waiver rules would apply, 

and courts can always say something like, under

 any standard of review, I would still reverse or 

affirm. So we think it will be much simpler and

 more streamlined.

 And, of course, there will be judicial 

review, which is really important, particularly 

in an immigration context, where an error can 

have disastrous consequences by -- by tearing 

apart families. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Because I think we 

thought about that in Guerrero and decided it's 

not worth the candle, but, in any event, another 

question about the limits of your argument, 

which is -- and this follows Justice Gorsuch's 

question. 

If the IJ said or the Board said we're 

going to assume arguendo eligibility, but as a 

matter of discretion -- exercising our 

discretion, we would deny cancellation of 

removal in any event, that determination would 

be unreviewable, correct? 

MS. SANTOS: Correct, Your Honor.

There -- there -- this Court does have a

 precedent on point.  It's something like

 Rumsmanabad, I can't recall, but, yes, there is 

a specific precedent on point that says exactly

 that.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice?

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I too just have some

 questions about the limits of your argument. 

So, in our colloquy earlier, did I understand 

you correctly to say that even if this is a 

mixed question, even if -- even if in theory 

Guerrero-Lasprilla applies here, permitting 

judicial review of the application of law to 

facts, that there's still a category of claims 

that a non-citizen might press on review that 

really are purely factual? 

MS. SANTOS: I -- I don't think that's 

what I was intending to say, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Oh. 

MS. SANTOS: My -- my -- my argument 

was that if in -- in a court of appeals a 

non-citizen presses purely factual, you know, 

challenges findings of historical fact, those 

will be unreviewable and a court of appeals can

support, you know, but I also accept that his 

grandmother cares for him, say, and so I just 

don't weigh it that heavily, is that a factual 

question or is that a mixed question?

 MS. SANTOS: I -- I don't think that 

is a factual question. I think it has to go 

into the overall analysis whether the

 non-citizen established exceptional and

 extremely unusual harm.  So I think that that --

that, you know, weighing might be viewed very 

deferentially because of the proximity of the IJ 

to the facts and experience, but it wouldn't 

make it unreviewable. 

And I think, here, for example, we 

might -- we would say, Your Honor, that the IJ 

really erroneously boiled the entire analysis 

down to economic detriment, which is not the way 

that you're supposed to apply the statutory 

provision. 

But -- but those -- any type of 

weighing would certainly be viewed 

deferentially.  I just don't think they'd be 

unreviewable because, if so --

don't understand that. I mean, I agree with you

if -- if say the IJ said, listen, all that 

matters is economics, and we'd say, well, that

 was a miss -- a misunderstanding of what the

 hardship standard requires.  I mean, I can see 

why that's a question of law.

 But, when you're talking about the 

weighing, I mean, let's say, yeah, I credit your

 testimony that you have a strong emotional bond

 with your son and vice versa.  I also have 

testimony here that I also credit that the 

grandmother cares for him -- I'm just making 

this up, I know it's not your case -- but that 

the -- the grandmother cares for him and there's 

a strong emotional support there, and so I just 

think given those two, you know, I -- I just 

don't think that the emotional support is 

enough of -- that the father provides is enough 

of a reason to say hardship. 

But you're saying that's a legal 

question, that kind of weighing?

constitutes a question of law --

 MS. SANTOS: -- as -- as the INA uses

 that term and that it would -- all of that would 

cash out under the standard-of-review analysis.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And then last 

question. You have said in response to Justice 

Kavanaugh's questions that the standard of

 review would be deferential, and you initially

 said abuse of discretion. 

And so I just want to clarify, is that 

what your position would be? 

MS. SANTOS: So there are various kind 

of articulations of deferential review.  We 

haven't briefed that.  And so I -- I suspect it 

would be abuse of discretion, but yes. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  But you're 

not -- you're not making a commitment, you're 

saying you suspect, but maybe it's clear error? 

MS. SANTOS: It -- it -- it might be. 

I mean, Your Honor, I -- I would just say that 

-- that that would I'm sure be briefed and has 

been briefed in other cases and we just haven't 

here, but I -- I do believe that it would be a

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So can I just go 

back to Justice Barrett's last hypothetical

looked at the factors and has said, I don't --

you know, I understand and accept your 

credibility about the strength of your emotional 

bond, but I also have testimony about the 

grandmother caring for your son, and at the end 

of the day, my conclusion, based on weighing all 

of these different factors and considering the 

evidence, is not met, this particular element. 

You, I think, say that's reviewable. 

I'd like to know what is the legal 

standard that I use as the court to review that 

determination and say yes, you're right, or no, 

you're wrong.  Am I looking at what?

IJ's determination, so we're affirming what the 

IJ has said about applying our own precedent to

 this circumstance?

 MS. SANTOS: Well, Your Honor, I don't

 makes it kind of extra special.  I think

 especially here --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, no, no, I'm just 

asking what the Court --

MS. SANTOS: Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- is supposed to do 

because we don't have a body of law that is 

existing outside, I think, of what the BIA has 

interpreted this to mean.  And so the Court --

MS. SANTOS: Right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- would have to 

say, I guess, BIA, you're wrong about your own 

view of whether your standard applies in this 

situation? 

MS. SANTOS: Well, so the -- the Court 

would be first starting with a standard that 

Congress set, right, and then it could decide 

whether it agrees with how the Board has 

interpreted it.

staying within the bounds of what Congress said. 

That's what this Court said in cases like Taylor

 you one more question.  In terms of the --

 Congress's intent -- and it's possible that you

 Guerrero, I was -- wasn't on the Court at that 

time, so I just want to be clear. 

MS. SANTOS: Sure. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I'm interested in 

the sort of idea that what is left here is 

precluding questions of fact and habeas review, 

and it just strikes me as a really convoluted 

way for Congress in writing this statute to 

achieve that result. 

They say several times no court shall 

have jurisdiction to review judgments in this 

area. And if really Congress just wanted to 

say, you can't review factual determinations of 

the agency, it seems to me there was a lot 

simpler way to go about that. 

So can you just help me with my --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- nagging concern 

that maybe this is not what Congress was

 intending?

 MS. SANTOS: Happy to do so, Your

 Honor, and this was specifically addressed both

 in Guerrero-Lasprilla and Patel. And I think 

what the Court said is a couple things. Number

 one, that this provision, the limited review

 provision, applies to a whole bunch of 

provisions throughout the INA.  So it applies to 

forms of relief under subsection (B).  It 

applies to criminal alien final orders for 

removal under (C).  It says it also applies to 

the entire rest of the INA. 

So I think what the Court said is, you 

know, Congress was trying to loop in a whole 

bunch of different things and it -- and it --

and it did it this way because it would apply to 

numerous different statutory provisions.  And, 

yes, perhaps, it might make more sense in some 

situations to say we just forbid findings of 

fact, but then it may have to kind of go 

provision by provision and explain when that was 

the case.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF COLLEEN SINZDAK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SINZDAK: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 The plain text of Section

 1252(a)(2)(B) and (D) requires courts to 

distinguish between reviewable constitutional 

claims and questions of law, which includes 

mixed questions, and any other judgment 

regarding the denial of non- -- of discretionary 

relief.  And in Patel, this Court was very clear 

that "any" meant "any." 

That included subjective and objective 

determinations.  That included the 

quintessentially discretionary determination of 

the -- at the second step as to whether an 

eligible non-citizen is -- should receive 

cancellation of removal.  But it also included 

credibility determinations, which the Court 

recognized required some objective fact-finding 

but also some exercise of discretion.  And it 

included simply finding historical facts.  This

 non-citizen has been in the country for 11 years

 and meets the continuous presence requirement.

 Now, in order to figure out whether 

any of those statutory determinations -- and all 

of the examples I just gave you are statutory 

determinations, they're made pursuant to a

 statute.  In order to figure out whether those

 statutory determinations fall within the

 exception that permits judicial review of 

questions of law and constitutional claim --

claims, the Court has to look at the statute and 

say: Okay, is this a statute that's asking for 

a legal conclusion, like fair use, or is this a 

statute that's saying find a fact or -- like in 

Pullman-Standard where we had intention to 

discriminate, pure question of fact, or is it a 

statute where the terminology is saying make a 

discretionary decision like in Williamsport Wire 

Rope, where we had the term "exceptional 

hardship" and the Court said that's requiring a 

-- a discretionary decision. 

And the Court has to figure that out 

in order to honor the plain text of Section

 statutory text says.

 And we think that if you apply the

 standard tools of -- statutory interpretation --

that's text, history, and precedent, that's the 

complicated framework that I think my friend is

 referring to -- if you apply those tools, you'll 

figure out that exceptional and extremely 

unusual hardship, that is a factual 

determination and that's an exercise of agency 

discretion.  That is not a legal conclusion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead.

It has said this is what we think the statutory

 text means.  It means make a decision about 

whether you think this non-citizen's facts are

 substantially beyond what you would get in an 

ordinary case. So the BIA has said make that 

discretionary judgment, make that predictive and

 comparative judgment, and -- and that's it.

 That's -- there's no legal element to that

 conclusion. 

So it's just a weighing of evidence. 

It's sort of -- it really reminds me of the 

credibility determination and the way that the 

Court talked about it in -- in Patel recently. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. -- Ms. --

Ms. Sinzdak, it strikes me that everything that 

you just said is -- is pretty much a 

relitigation of the issue that was raised in 

Guerrero, that the government came in, basically 

made the same argument.  The government said, 

you know, there are mixed questions and then 

there are mixed questions.  There are mixed 

questions that are really super factual. 

And we accepted that distinction when 

it came to standards of review in Lakeridge, but 

we specifically did not accept it when it came

to this question. We said, you know what, we

 don't really care if it's primarily factual.  We

 don't really care if it involves a lot of

 judgment calls.  We don't really care if you 

have to really kind of search for the legal

 standard in the inquiry.  As long as there is 

that legal standard and as long as all the

 fact-finding that you do and all the

 fact-weighing that you do eventually has to 

satisfy that legal standard, and the question is 

whether it does, it's a mixed question and it's 

reviewable.  That's how I read that decision. 

You're just, you know, basically 

saying you don't like it. 

MS. SINZDAK: No.  To be clear, we 

accept the holding of Guerrero-Lasprilla, and we 

are not up here saying that mixed questions are 

unreviewable.  So, if -- if we thought that the 

exceptional and extremely unusual hardship had a 

legal component, even if it was mixed in with 

the facts, then it would not be reviewable. 

But what we are here saying is just 

because a statute is -- is -- a term is in a 

statute, that doesn't mean that it -- it 

establishes a legal standard in the sense that

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, here's the --

here was the -- I mean, the question in Guerrero 

was this equitable tolling question, which is 

primarily a question of whether extraordinary

 circumstances prevent a litigant from doing what

 she should have done. 

I mean, it's the exact same thing. Is 

-- are there extraordinary circumstances here? 

Well, we're going to, you know, think about 

facts a real lot.  You know, what were those 

circumstances? And how extraordinary were they 

when they're compared to other circumstances 

that make it difficult to -- to do what the 

legal rules tell you you have to do? 

I mean, I don't really see any 

distinction in the nature of the inquiry here. 

MS. SINZDAK: I -- I -- I disagree. 

And I first just want to point out that there 

was no debate in Guerrero-Lasprilla that the 

Court was dealing with a mixed question.  So 

what -- what concerns -- what constituted a 

mixed question wasn't before the Court.

for that is I think exactly what Justice Alito 

was speaking about earlier, which is that due

 diligence is a legal concept.  It's a -- it's a

 creature of the law.  It's a --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, you can say

 that, but what it asks a -- a -- a fact -- what

 it asks a decision-maker to do is say how

 extraordinary were the circumstances that

 prevented you from following the rules. 

And that's exactly the nature of the 

question here.  How extraordinary are the 

circumstances that -- that -- that -- that --

that -- that were involved in a particular case? 

MS. SINZDAK: Now you are correct that 

there is some overlap and there are some similar 

things that adjudicators are being asked to do. 

I have to say what I find a little bit 

unsatisfying but it's just the facts here is 

that distinguishing questions of law from 

questions of fact and discretion is often a 

matter of history.  So one of the things that 

the Court repeatedly has done is just said, is 

this the type of analysis that the courts have 

done? It is a question of law.  And we see that 

in Teva.  We see that in Oracle.

Is this the sort of thing, question 

that has been decided by juries or by fact

 finders?  Then it's not going to be --

 considered a question of law.

 And I really do think that the common 

law history of the due diligence inquiry that 

this is something that had -- was a judge-made 

inquiry that was always decided by judges,

 elaborated by judges --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That sounds very 

complicated.  I mean, Ms. Santos says there are 

75 of these, and we're going to do that analysis 

as to whether each of them is reviewable or not 

reviewable?  We're going to look into the 

history, we're going to look into the source of 

law, we're going to look into, you know, who 

primarily has prerogative over this issue.  It 

seems like Guerrero, when it came down to it, 

this is what Justice Kavanaugh said, is that is 

not worth the candle. 

You know, of course, these are going 

to be reviewed extremely deferentially, but if 

there's a legal standard at issue, if the 

conclusion that the Court comes to is in the end 

do these set of facts as found, as weighed,

satisfy this legal standard, then the better 

course is just to call it a day and say it's 

reviewable and not have to go any further.

 MS. SINZDAK: So I want to make a

 couple points here.  The first is that you're

 going to have to perform what you're referring 

to as a complicated analysis, which I would 

refer to as simply statutory interpretation and 

what the Court does every time it decides a 

standard of review and -- and here's the --

where I'm getting to -- you're going to have to 

perform this analysis under Petitioner's 

framework because Petitioner is saying the 

standard of review is going to turn on whether 

this is an exercise of discretion.  I think 

she's saying abuse-of-discretion review.  So 

it's going to -- to -- to turn on whether it's 

an exercise of discretion or it's a factual 

finding or it's a question of law. 

And what we're saying is, look, that's 

not the right analysis because the -- the 

statute says, no, it has to be a question of law 

for it to be reviewable at all.

you're going to avoid it.  You're just going to

 get these questions --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, but --

 standard-of-review framework.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- on the -- on

 the standard of review, there are lots of 

different framings you can put on it. It's --

there are two main buckets, though, deferential 

or de novo, and I think what she was saying is 

it's going to be deferential. 

MS. SINZDAK: I -- I'm not sure --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And -- and so I 

don't know that, you know, you can frame it a 

lot of different ways, but, basically, as -- as 

counsel said, I think correctly, the usual 

analysis when you're doing these, and we've done 

a lot of these, is has the agency jumped the 

rails of reasonableness in how it determined 

whether a given set of facts constituted 

something extremely unusual. 

MS. SINZDAK: I -- I think the -- the 

problem here is that questions of law are

reviewed de novo. That's sort of blackletter

 law. And, in fact, the Fourth Circuit has 

reviewed a number of these exceptional and 

extremely unusual circumstances findings de novo

 because they've said, well, we know the only --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, that's not 

-- I mean, that's probably not correct to do it 

de novo in those circumstances, is what counsel 

acknowledged and I think correctly, like Judge 

Murphy said in the Sixth Circuit opinion, I 

think was, okay, it's reviewable, what changes, 

perhaps not much in terms of bottom line because 

it's going to be deferential review, right? 

MS. SINZDAK: We -- we think the 

problem again is that the only thing that 

Congress made reviewable is a question of law. 

So, as long as you're talking --

 reviewing something that's not a question of 

law, so de novo review is obviously not 

appropriate, I think you're in a little bit of

 trouble because it seems like actually now we're

 talking about discretion, we're talking about

 fact-finding.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, this is now

 Groundhog Day from Guerrero because we talked

 about the history of St. Cyr and how the 

decision there recognized and the subsequent 

congressional history recognized that 

applications of law to fact would be considered 

questions of law even though I'm with you as a 

first principle, I might not have gone down that 

road that Congress did, but that was, I think, 

the clear understanding of what questions of law 

covered, and we said as much in Guerrero, so 

that kind of ended that discussion at least as I 

thought about it. 

MS. SINZDAK: No, again, what Guerrero 

said is that when you have a mixed question, so 

that assumes that there is a legal component, 

but what you have to be pointing to is what is 

the legal question, and there isn't a legal 

question there.

judges all the time that, yes, the district 

court has ample room of discretion and discovery 

in undue hardship, in due diligence, in lots of 

things, but there are boundaries set by law that 

they cannot exceed.  The guardrails are wide, 

but they're there.

boundaries, they've erred as a matter of law,

 right?

 MS. SINZDAK: I -- yes, but I want to 

say you have to articulate what that boundary

 is. So, if Petitioner was here --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, I just want to

 make sure I -- I heard the first part of the

 answer was yes? 

(Laughter.) 

MS. SINZDAK: The first part of the 

answer is if -- yes, because we have conceded if 

Petitioner says, as the -- the law says 

exceptional and unusual circumstances, and 

exceptional does not mean, for example, unique 

and, here, the agency has said it means unique. 

That's an error of law.  That's a 

misinterpretation of the statute.  And that's a 

guardrail, you're right, that's a boundary.  An 

agency cannot do something that the statute 

doesn't permit it to do.  And if the statute --

if -- if -- if they do and if a non-citizen says 

you have transgressed the boundaries that the 

statute sets, then that's a question of law.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No, in Patel, he's 

saying -- no, no, no, no. In Patel, he's saying 

you're wrong, you know, I was credible.  That's 

different.  That was one fact.  This is saying 

here are guardrails, I'm entitled for my 

eligibility determination to say that I'm 

eligible if I can show hardship required by the 

statute, and I have shown something that by any 

measure would be extreme and unusual, and you 

have said applying that statutory standard to my 

circumstances, that it's not. 

MS. SINZDAK: So I think there, if 

you're making it a legal question, if you're 

saying the term "exceptional and extremely 

unusual circumstances" --

 situation where you're saying no reasonable --

no reasonable adjudicator who understood the law 

or who understood that -- that -- what 

credibility meant could have reached this 

conclusion. 

And that is exactly what the 

petitioner in Patel was saying, and the Court 

still said no, it's a question of fact and so 

it's not reviewable. 

And what we're saying is it's the same 

for questions of discretion.  When the agency is 

being asked to make a comparative or a 

predictive judgment, that is something that was

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let me try it

 this way.  Suppose that the -- the judge says --

recites the legal standard and then has another 

sentence and said this means it has to be a

 one-in-a-billion case.

 Now you would say that that's

 reviewable, and we could say no, the judge got

 it wrong, correct?

 MS. SINZDAK: Because that's the wrong 

-- a misinterpretation of the statutory text, 

that's correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So I think what 

Justice Barrett is suggesting is that the -- the 

judge is doing the exact same thing.  The judge 

doesn't say this -- it has to be a one-in-a-

billion case, but the judge is acting as though 

it has to be a one-in-a-billion case. 

And what Justice Barrett is suggesting 

is, well, in that case, again, there's been a 

legal error.  The Court has looked at some set 

of facts and reached a conclusion that is 

utterly inconsistent with the legal standard 

that is supposed to be applied. 

MS. SINZDAK: So it's not a legal 

standard.  I -- it's a --

you say discretion or legal error. So can I

 just focus in on Justice Kagan's example to

 explain what I see as the distinction?  And you 

can tell me if I'm wrong.

 So, when the court -- the IJ says, I 

look at this statute, extreme and unusual, and I 

think that means that this has to be a

 one-in-a-billion case, the IG has stated a rule 

of interpretation, it's interpreting that 

language and it's now applying this rule, I'm 

looking for a one-in-a-billion case. 

All right. You would agree that 

that's a legal question.  If someone is claiming 

that that's the wrong rule, that it doesn't have 

to be a one-in-a-billion case, that we've got a 

legal dispute, correct? 

MS. SINZDAK: Exactly.  Correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Is there 

a difference between that and a situation in 

which we accept that it -- the IG is correct in 

his rule.  It has to be a one-in-a-billion case. 

But the IG in applying that rule looks at this 

constellation of facts that has been presented, 

finds the facts, and we all agree on the facts,

 different factors and things, I think this is

 not a one-in-a-billion case, all right?

 And then the Petitioner says:  I agree 

with his legal rule, I agree with all the 10

 facts that he's found, but I think, Court, this

 is a one-in-a-billion case.  Decide.

 Is that second thing the same kind of

 legal issue, is it presenting a legal issue?  I 

hear you saying it's not.  And so can you 

explain why not? 

MS. SINZDAK: Right.  That's an 

exercise of discretion.  That's exactly our 

point. That is an exercise of discretion.  Like 

when the -- the IJ says, you know, this 

non-citizen has satisfied the eligibility 

factors.  Now I need to look at all of these 

facts and exercise my discretion to decide 

whether it -- I -- this is an appropriate case 

for cancellation of removal. 

So it's the same thing.

 critical facts:  child dying of cancer, sole

 Are you willing to tell me on that 

record that that's not a one-in-a-million case? 

Isn't that an error of applying facts to -- to a

 legal standard?  There's no discretion in that.

 MS. SINZDAK: So I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it's an

MS. SINZDAK: -- I agree that if what 

the Court says is the Board obviously 

interpreted the statute to require a

it's an abuse of discretion, but on what basis 

is the Court able to make that determination? 

What I think as Justice Jackson looks abusive?

 What am I pointing to to make that decision?

 MS. SINZDAK: Yes.  That's exactly

 right. So the statute entrusts that

 discretionary determination, that judgment call, 

that prediction about how much hardship will 

this particular non-citizen's relative likely 

face, how does that compare?  Those are judgment 

calls. Those aren't -- those --

facts, that a judge doesn't have the ability to 

say, you know, that immigration judge, we know 

that they're overworked, we know that they do a 

great job on 99 percent of the cases, but that

 judge just got it wrong.

 MS. SINZDAK: That's the determination 

that Congress made in 1996 when it barred review

 of any decision --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The determination that 

Congress made --

MS. SINZDAK: -- regardless of a 

denial of discretionary relief. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- was to give legal 

questions to judges.  And -- and this is a 

question where -- where the -- the -- the 

fundamental inquiry is do those facts, as found, 

as weighed, meet the legal standard?  And this 

judge got it wrong, this judge being in not this 

case but in Justice Barrett's hypothetical. 

MS. SINZDAK: Again, if you can point 

to a legal error, so if you can say looking at 

these facts the judge must have misinterpreted 

the statute, must have said this is a 

one-in-a-million case, that's a legal error.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you agree --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why -- why isn't

 that exactly Justice Barrett's case?  Because 

the BIA, for example, has said that the 

standard, high as it is, doesn't require it to

 be unconscionable.  That's -- that's the BIA's 

own standard.  It doesn't have to be the 

one-in-a-billion case. It's something less than 

that. And, here, we have in Justice Barrett's 

hypothetical basically the one-in-a-billion 

case, right?  That -- let's assume that, okay? 

And why -- why couldn't, again, a 

court say, as Justice Kagan keeps trying to ask, 

in those circumstances, you have effectively 

misread the legal standard?

trying to tell Justice Kagan that if -- it --

 error which raises a question of law, then

 review is permissible.

a court can say it doesn't have to be a one in a

denies relief, it erred.

demanding than that.  A court can say no.  The

 misinterpreted the statute, then it's

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Does "questions of 

law" in the statute include application of law

 MS. SINZDAK: It includes legal

 errors.

application of law to fact? 

MS. SINZDAK: Yes, and I'm explaining 

to you what that -- what that --

So, in that way, in that -- in those cases, it 

was actually like a bankruptcy --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No, but I think 

what Justice Gorsuch is getting at is -- at

 least in my administrative law experience, abuse

 of discretion is probably a distracting term.

 Let's call it an unreasonable application of law 

to fact. That's something we did all the time. 

Now unreasonable application of law to 

fact means wide discretion, but deference is not 

abdication is often said.  And so there should 

not be abdication.  There should be deference in 

the review of application of law to fact. 

MS. SINZDAK: But Congress was doing 

something when it said that denials of 

discretionary relief, judgments involving --

regarding denials of discretion are off limits. 

And if you're --

 MS. SINZDAK: Okay.  What you're

 saying, I think, is sometimes the -- the --

the -- an agency exercises its discretion in a 

way that just seems totally inappropriate.

 But -- but, again, what -- what Congress did was 

take off the table the review of discretionary 

determinations. It just took that wholly off 

limits.

make, but one might say, look, all right, here's 

Guerrero-Lasprilla.  It involved the application 

of a standard that only a lawyer can understand.

 would be, for example, submitted to a jury 

without elaborate instructions or perhaps would

 not be submitted to a jury at all.  And that's

 one way to read Guerrero-Lasprilla.

 If you read it for all it's worth, as 

broadly as some of the questions suggest, it has

 the effect of making everything reviewable.  And 

-- and that is a strange way to read a statute 

that begins by saying that judgments are not 

reviewable. 

If -- so the test would be this, and 

it isn't really all that complicated.  If what 

is involved in a particular case -- and, you 

know, you could say abuse of discretion and 

unreasonable application, but, look, anybody 

who's litigated cases or has seen what willful 

judges can do knows that if you allow that 

little toe in the door, an awful lot can be done 

with it.  That might be right or wrong.  Judges 

love judicial review.  Congress was less 

enamored of it when it enacted this statute. It 

says no, no review at all, not abuse of 

discretion. 

So the test could be restated as if it 

is the sort of thing that would be submitted to

involves ordinary terms like "exceptional and 

unusual hardship," that is not something that

 falls within the exception.

 MS. SINZDAK: Yes.  And I -- I -- I

 think that actually dovetails very neatly with 

what the Court already said in Pullman-Standard, 

where it said, you know, intention to

 discriminate, right, you can -- you -- that's a 

statutory requirement.  You might say there 

could be questions about what that means.  And 

the Court said it could have, Congress could 

have been trying to refer to some legal 

presumption, some legal concept of 

discrimination or intention to discriminate, 

but, instead, what it said:  No, look, apply 

statutory construction.  What actually Congress 

was telling us to do here was just to find out 

actual motive. 

And, here, it's the same thing. 

Congress wasn't making this new legal concept, 

exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. 

Congress was saying: Agency, make a judgment 

call. Make a predictive and comparative 

judgment call about how the circumstances of

No, it's not mixed at all because --

lawless.  Basically, that's what you're saying, 

because you can't call a standard a standard, 

exceptional, due diligence, undue hardship, you 

can't put words on a piece of paper and call the 

words meaningless.  They have to set a standard. 

And once you set a standard, you're 

going to have to judge whether the facts fit 

that standard.  Once you do that, 

Guerrero-Lasprilla said that's a mixed question 

of law that's reviewable by the Court.  We may 

not like the number of cases that come up, but I

 Justice Barrett points out that the

 cases are rare, but they still exist, meaning

 that's why we have judicial review.  It's rare

 that federal convictions are overturned.  I

 think it's probably 5 percent or it was a very

 low number of federal convictions were ever 

overturned, yet we still permit review of them. 

We permit review not for the majority 

of cases.  We permit review for the exceptions. 

And so I don't know how we get to where you want 

us to go unless we reject our precedent --

of discretionary relief is unreviewable unless

 it involves a legal question.

 But, when it doesn't, when it's an 

exercise of discretion, as it -- the Court said 

in Williamsport Wire Rope, which is also this 

Court's precedent, that exceptional hardship, 

that was a discretionary question, and 

discretionary questions we know under Patel, we

 know under the plain text are unreviewable. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? 

Justice Gorsuch? 

Justice Kavanaugh? 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I do have a few 

questions.  If the Court concludes that the BIA 

or the IJ misapplied Board precedent that 

existed, what's -- is that reviewable or not? 

MS. SINZDAK: So the IJ is bound to 

follow Board precedent, so if the IJ has 

discarded Board precedent, that's a legal error. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  And then I 

agree with a lot of what Justice Alito said 

about going back to the beginning, but I think 

St. -- St. Cyr talked about what was available 

in habeas and said specifically that it's not 

only legal questions but the erroneous

 application of statutes or interpretation.  It

 distinguished those two things.

 Then Guerrero picks up on that and

 says "English cases consistently 

demonstrate...", consistent with St. Cyr, "that 

the 'erroneous application of statutes' includes

 the misapplication of a legal standard to the 

facts of a particular case" and then says that

 Congress took up that suggestion and then, when 

it put questions of law in, included erroneous 

application of law to the facts of a particular 

case. 

Do you disagree with any of that? 

MS. SINZDAK: No.  Again, when there's 

been a legal error and that all of the cases 

that you are talking about involve legal errors, 

then, yes, it's reviewable. 

But, unless you're saying that the 

argument that someone was a -- the -- about 

whether someone was continuously present for 10 

years, that the determination that he was in the 

country for nine years rather than 10 --

application of law to fact.

 MS. SINZDAK: So then we know -- then

belabor this part, but what a legal standard is.

 You're -- you're saying this is not a legal

MS. SINZDAK: I -- I'm saying the 

statutory determination, just because it's a 

statutory determination, doesn't mean that its

say. 

Now I think that -- that that means 

that a legal standard is not synonymous with a

has explained to you how you can tell, once you 

have a statutory determination, which statutory 

determinations only require fact-finding, only 

require discretion, only require a mix of those 

two, and which -- present legal conclusions.

 statutory determination is reviewable.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  And then 

last one, you've emphasized repeatedly, I think

 correctly, that the statute's about discretion

 ultimately.  And I agree with that, but that

 discretion is at the -- as I've understood it,

 is at the second step. So, after you determine 

whether someone's eligible for cancellation of 

removal, then the Board has complete discretion 

to say, you know what, you're eligible or I'll 

assume you're eligible, but you're not getting 

it. You're not getting it.  And that is totally 

unreviewable.  So that -- there's where --

that's a huge amount of discretion for the 

Board. That's where the discretion is, not in 

doing the 10 years, extremely unusual.  Those 

parts are the eligibility requirements.  That's 

not as discretionary. 

MS. SINZDAK: So, in Jong -- Jong Ha 

Wang --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah. 

MS. SINZDAK: -- this Court said that 

when a court of appeals usurped the Board's 

right to determine what was an extreme hardship 

in that case -- that was before this change --

that that deprived the Board of a good portion 

of the discretion that had been vested in it.

 So I think this Court has already recognized

 that exceptional -- or extreme hardship, now

 exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,

 that's discretionary.

 And I would also point to -- to -- to

 Octane, which recognizes that "exceptional" is a

 term that itself conveys discretion. 

So I think just because there's 

discretion at the second step doesn't mean 

there's not also discretion at the first step.

 hardship down the road, for example.  And the 

courts of appeals have said, well, that's 

speculation and, you know, that was within the 

IJ's authority to find that fact.

 So, if you lost and if we said under

 Guerrero that mixed questions are reviewable and 

so the application of law to fact in the kind of

 hypothetical I gave would not be subject to the 

jurisdictional bar, do you agree that a lot of 

the questions will still be -- a lot of the 

cases will still be unreviewable on appeal 

because they will still essentially be factual 

challenges barred under Patel? 

MS. SINZDAK: Absolutely.  And to be 

clear, I think the government is -- is fine with 

a ruling that says where there is a legal error 

that is -- that is revealed through the Board's 

determination, that's reviewable. 

What's not reviewable is -- I mean, 

you can call it fact-finding, you can call it 

discretion.  I think, as we make this -- this 

point at, I believe, page 42 of our brief, that 

a lot of times in the administrative context, 

what counts as a fact is -- can look pretty

 stuff actually is reviewable?

 MS. SINZDAK: I -- I agree, and I

 think this is a really important point.  I 

think, if the Court is going to say facts are

 unreviewable, but there's some legal component, 

I think it's going to be very important for the 

Court to spell out what are the facts.  And I'm 

-- I'm not sure, to be honest. I think the 

Court is saying that -- or I -- I -- I hear Your 

Honor to be saying that if it's a -- a 

prediction about the future, that might be -- be 

included.  It has long been concluded as a fact, 

again, like forecasts about lost earning 

potential.  That's a classic fact. 

So I think the Court's going to need 

to say, like, a prediction.  I think the Court 

should look at cases like Williamsport Wire Rope 

and say a comparison where you're looking at, 

you know, is this non-citizen going -- more 

likely than another to experience hardship, I 

think those are going to be facts.

to need to be very careful to give the Court the 

-- the Board the guidance that it needs to say

 what is a fact.  And I do think that we've given 

you sort of a framework of how the Court in the 

past has looked at that law/facts divide, and we 

-- we admit the Court has said there's not one

 principle, right?  It's a framework.  You've got 

to look at the history.  You've got to look at

 different things. 

But, yes, I mean, if the Court wants 

to say just apply that law -- that -- that 

law/facts divide and put all of the things like 

predictions, like comparisons on the fact side, 

we'd be very happy.  We do think that the -- the

guidance.

there -- there was some back and forth with your 

friend on the other side suggesting that you've 

-- you're going to open up a can of worms and 

theirs is better. So can you just speak to

 that?

 MS. SINZDAK: So, first of all, I

 think this is the way that most courts are 

already handling a lot of these things. So it's 

not going to open up a can of worms in that 

regard. 

The other thing that I'd say is this 

is just a matter of statutory construction, so 

you just need to look at whether we're dealing 

with a question of law.  And I actually think 

courts are -- are pretty experienced in knowing 

what questions of law look like. This is, 

again, the standard-of-review analysis.  Every 

time they have to say am I dealing with a 

question of law, am I dealing with a mixed 

question, or am I dealing with, you know, 

something discretionary or factual?  And I don't 

think that's like a --

MS. SINZDAK: Absolutely.  Exactly.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- the other side's

 test?

 MS. SINZDAK: So that's -- that's the

 second point.  And I'd also note that we've --

we -- sort of talking to our lawyers who 

litigate these cases, exceptional and extremely

 unusual hardship, that's the big one.  That's

 what comes up again and again.  But, beyond 

this, they've pointed to maybe four or five 

things that are getting -- that -- that are 

getting litigated. 

So I -- I think that maybe Petitioner 

has kind of gone through the law books and said 

what might I possibly make some kind of argument 

that this is a little bit mixy, mixed, a little 

bit legal.  But that's not what's happening on 

the ground.  We're talking about maybe like a 

few other -- other things, and I think, if this 

Court provides enough guidance as to how you 

distinguish between law and facts, how you 

distinguish between a mixed question and a 

question regarding discretion or fact, I think 

that's going to clear up any confusion that's 

left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAIME A. SANTOS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SANTOS: Thank you, Your Honor.

 I have about 42 points I'd like to 

address on rebuttal, but I will settle for about 

five. 

First, I think that my friend on the 

other side has mistakenly focused a lot of her 

argument on what Congress did in 1996.  This 

case is about what Congress did in 2005 when it 

created an exception to Section 1250 --

1252(a)(2)(B) and it -- it amended both 

(a)(2)(B) and (a)(2)(D) to make clear that the 

limited review provision trumps the designation 

of a particular determination as discretionary. 

Second, Your Honor, I think all of my 

friend's arguments about this not being a legal 

standard really run smack into the Board's own 

understanding of what the -- the hardship 

determination is.  The Board said itself no more 

than -- no less than a dozen times in its

 precedential decision in Monreal-Aguinaga that

 this is a standard.  It used its -- its

 purported authority under Chevron to interpret 

that standard using the canons of statutory 

construction that courts use day in and day out. 

And it said the meaning of that standard can be

 further given -- given -- shed light on it

 through case-by-case adjudication, which is all 

we're asking for federal courts to have the 

power to do. 

I think that the -- the notion that 

it's not a legal standard just makes no sense. 

And I think the same is true with the notion 

that this is discretionary. Neither IJs nor the 

BIA understand themselves to have discretion 

when deciding whether someone is eligible for 

cancellation.  And you can see this in cases 

like Monreal-Aguinaga, where the Board says 

things like, you know, if we only had 

discretion, we would absolutely -- grant 

cancellation, but Congress has put these 

constraints on us, so we don't have the power to 

do so.

a fair bit of discussion about the expertise

that the agency has that makes it well 

positioned to make these determinations I think 

in both sides of the argument. But the same

 could be said of every decision that immigration 

judges make, that patent ALJs make, that

 district judge make -- district judges make

 during sentencing.  But appellate review is 

still a core and fundamentally important way

 that -- that appellate courts make sure that 

agencies and district courts stay within the 

guardrails, as -- as several Justices have 

mentioned. 

And I think that's true even where 

appellate review involves deference.  In cases 

where court -- courts adopt deferential review 

for mixed questions like Cooter & Gell and like 

Village of Lakeridge, the Court still takes 

pains to emphasize that if appellate -- if -- if 

district courts or agencies are -- are going 

outside the guardrails, that appellate courts 

will be able to intervene and correct 

misapplications of law, misunderstandings of 

law, and inconsistent applications of law.

immigration decisions, where the risk of error

critical. And I would point you to the former 

IJ and BIA brief to talk about the -- that --

that talks about the enormous resource 

constraints that the agency is under. These

 officials are doing their best every day, but 

when you have 3,000 backlogged cases on your 

docket, mistakes are going to happen.

 And the -- the government's position 

incredibly is that as long as an IJ or the BIA 

just recites the right standard in a boilerplate 

section of its decision, it can go on to 

egregiously, arbitrarily, or completely 

inconsistently apply that decision and courts 

are powerless to intervene.  I think that 

Guerrero-Lasprilla squarely rejected that 

extreme result, and -- and the government has 

pointed to no reason for a different result 

here. 

Last, Your Honor, I -- I would point 

to the -- the history test that -- that my

historical test, but the point of jurisdiction

 decide if you have power to hear a case.

 And even if some kind of historical 

approach were appropriate, the government's test

 here wouldn't be it. In the standard-of-review 

context, courts look for a long and consistent

 application -- appellate practice over an entire

 genre or class of decisions.

 They don't scour the U.S. Code to look 

for a single statute with one or two words in 

common and use that as a smoking gun for the way 

the -- the government tries to use a World War I 

era tax statute here.  And even under -- and 

under the kind of standard-of-review-type 

analysis, the government certainly can't point 

to any long and consistent history of appellate 

practice. 

At best, it has this 1919 tax statute, 

which wasn't reviewed.  That -- that was 

exceptional circumstances.  It points to 

exceptional case determinations of the Patent 

Act which were reviewed for abuse of discretion.

reviewed de novo.  So, even under a

 argument that -- that it wouldn't make any sense 

for the standard of review to be mismatched with 

judicial review is exactly the argument that the

 government made in Guerrero-Lasprilla and it's 

exactly what the majority's opinion expressly

 rejected.  And I think that most of my friend's 

arguments today were -- were the same arguments 

the government made there. 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:34 p.m., the case 

was submitted.)
