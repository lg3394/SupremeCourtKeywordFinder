 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 argument this morning in Case 23-5572, Fischer

 versus United States. 

Mr. Green.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Congress enacted 1512(c) in 2002 in 

the wake of the large-scale destruction of 

Enron's financial documents.  The statute 

therefore prohibits the impairment of the 

integrity or availability of -- of information 

and evidence to be used in a proceeding.  In 

2002, Congress hedged a little bit and added 

Section (c)(2) to cover other forms of 

impairment, the known unknowns, so to speak.  It 

was, after all, the dawn of the Information Age. 

Until the January 6th prosecutions, 

Section 1512(c)(2), the "otherwise" provision, 

had never been used to prosecute anything other 

than evidence tampering, and that was for good 

reason.  This Court has said that "otherwise,"

when used in a criminal statute, means to do 

similar conduct in a different way.

 The government would have you ignore 

all that or disregard all that and instead 

convert (c)(2) from a catchall provision into a

 dragnet.  One of the things that that dragnet

 would cover is Section (c)(1).  Our construction 

of the statute at least leaves (c)(1) and (c)(2)

 to do some independent work. 

The January 6th prosecutions 

demonstrate that there are a host of felony and 

misdemeanor crimes that cover the alleged 

conduct.  A Sarbanes-Oxley-based, Enron-driven 

evidence-tampering statute is not one of them. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Green, how do we 

determine what these two provisions have in 

common?  Do we look after the "otherwise" or 

before and why? 

MR. GREEN: We -- you look at before, 

Justice Thomas, and you look at the kinds of 

manner in which documents and records are to be 

impaired, and then you look after to see what 

the effect is. But I would submit that the 

effect is the same, right, in order to cause the

impairment of the integrity of the evidence 

that's to be used in a proceeding or to prevent

 its availability.

 So we look back and we look forward.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Wouldn't it be just

 as easy to look at (c) -- at the (c)(2) and then 

ask what it has in common with (c)(1) and use 

(c)(2)'s provisions as the basis for that

 similarity? 

MR. GREEN: No, because in -- in --

(c)(2) speaks to the effect of the actions that 

the "otherwise" clause covers.  So, in other 

words, we look at (c)(1) and we see that 

Congress is concerned about documents and 

records and other objects and things that are 

done to those to impair the integrity of those, 

and the effect of that is to obstruct.  And so 

(c)(2) omits that object and verb section. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But you could just as 

easily say that Congress is really concerned 

about things that obstruct, influence, or impede 

official proceedings, and that's (c)(2).  So why 

isn't that the basis for the similarity? 

MR. GREEN: Well, because of the -- of 

the -- the presence of the "otherwise"

 provision.  So "otherwise," as I mentioned 

-- and -- and "otherwise," this Court has said, 

means to do similar conduct in a different way. 

So what we've got here is -- is the impairment 

of evidence being done in a different way.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I -- I 

thought was, yes, doing it in a different way,

 so let me give you an example.  There is a sign 

on the theater: You will be kicked out of the 

theater if you photograph or record the actors 

or otherwise disrupt the performance. 

If you start yelling, I think no one 

would question that you can be expected to be 

kicked out under this policy, even though 

yelling has nothing to do with photograph or 

recording.  The object that the verb is looking 

at, the verbs are looking at, is the 

obstruction.  It's not the manner in which you 

obstruct; it's the fact that you've obstructed. 

Isn't that the structure of this 

provision? 

MR. GREEN: It is, Your Honor.  It --

it's -- it's in part the structure of the 

provision.  But what -- what your hypothetical 

omits is that there is a specific retriculation,

I guess it's called, of all of the different

 sorts of things that might be done to evidence

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that --

MR. GREEN: There's a long --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what's 

fascinating about (1), which is not about (2), 

is that (1) doesn't require you to have actually

 impeded the proceeding.  (1) requires you to 

have that intent, but you don't actually have to 

accomplish the intent.  (2) requires you to 

accomplish the intent.  And so that's a very 

different articulation of what the object of (2) 

is. The object of (2) is the actual disruption 

of the proceeding. 

MR. GREEN: Well, I would respectfully 

disagree because, I mean, both --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why?  Look 

at the language. 

MR. GREEN: Yeah. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  "Alters, destroys, 

mutilates, or conceals a record."  I do that in 

my home, and I do it anticipating that it might 

be needed.  All I have to do is have the intent 

to impair.  By that very language, I don't have

 MR. GREEN: I guess I'm -- I -- I

 guess I'm a little confused, Justice Sotomayor,

government would say that any attempt at (1) is 

also covered by the statute, and I'm not sure 

that I would disagree. So I'm not -- I -- I 

don't think that there has to be an actual 

impairment. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I do think, 

under (1), you don't need an actual impairment. 

Under (2), you do. 

MR. GREEN: Okay.  Well, or --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you read it --

MR. GREEN: But -- but (2) says or 

attempts --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the -- the verb 

requires you to actually obstruct the proceeding 

in (2). Nowhere in (1) do you actually have to 

obstruct.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, can I ask

 you whether -- let's -- let's imagine that we

 agree with you.  On remand, do you agree that 

the government could take a shot at proving that 

your client actually did try to interfere with 

or, under (c)(1) -- or, actually, no -- sorry --

under (c)(2), obstruct evidence because he was 

trying to obstruct the arrival of the 

certificates arriving to the vice president's 

desk for counting?  So there would be an 

evidence impairment theory? 

MR. GREEN: I'm quite sure that my 

friend would take a shot, Your Honor, but I 

would -- I would -- I would say no, and the 

reason why is that this statute prohibits 

operation on -- on specific evidence in some 

way, shape, or form. 

Attempting to stop a vote count or 

something like that is a very different act than 

actually changing a document or altering a 

document or creating a fake new document.

 mean, he's not actually altering the -- the vote

 certificates, which is why I corrected myself 

and said under (c)(2). I mean, would that be 

different than someone, say, in a trial or a 

criminal proceeding trying to prevent evidence 

that was going to be introduced in the

 proceeding from making it there? So I'm -- I'm

 imagining him acting on the certificates, not 

the act of counting them. 

MR. GREEN: Well, again, I think they 

could try it, but I -- I don't think that we're 

talking about trying to impair just anything 

other than the evidence itself.  We're trying to 

obstruct a proceeding, and there's questions 

about what "proceeding" means here, as Your 

Honor doubtless knows. 

But what the government would 

essentially be doing, as you noted, is 

converting what they've charged in (c)(2) to a 

(c)(1) type of crime. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, no, no, no, 

no. (c)(2) -- I mean, as I -- maybe I'm 

misunderstanding your argument, but I thought 

your argument was that (c)(2) picks up other

 evidence-related.

 So, in the hypothetical I'm giving

 you, it's evidence-related because it's focused

 on the certificates, but it's obstruct, obstruct 

or impede, say, the certificates arriving to the

 vice president's desk insofar as the goal was to

 shut down the proceeding and therefore interfere

 with the evidence reaching the vice president. 

MR. GREEN: I -- I still -- that's 

closer.  It's definitely closer. But, if you 

zoom out and look at all of 1512 in order to 

understand what kinds of impairment we're 

talking about, we are talking about or Congress 

is prohibiting the kinds of impairments that 

actually change documents that actually affect 

their integrity. 

If it's just impeding or delaying, 

we'd submit actually that that is not part of 

1512(c).  Delays are mentioned in five other 

parts of 1512 but not in (c).

only the theory of (c)(1) and you're saying that 

you have to make it into (c)(1) in order to

 be -- you know, to have this statute apply.

 So can -- can you help me at least 

understand under your theory what additional

 thing does (c)(2) offer? 

MR. GREEN: Let's -- let's look at the 

verbs of (c)(1), which are "alter," "destroy,"

 "mutilate," and "conceal," and let's think about 

their antonyms.  So one instead of "destroy" 

would be actually to create.  So one could use 

some sophisticated computer program, we've heard 

an awful lot about AI, and we've heard about the 

possibility of deepfake photographs. 

So I -- I think you would violate 

(c)(2) if you created a photograph that 

established your alibi in -- in some extremely 

sophisticated way that would get it admitted 

into evidence or make it -- or you submit it for 

evidence would probably be where the crime 

occurs. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you're saying 

there are other things other than particularly 

altering, destroying, mutilating, or concealing, 

but it has to be limited to a record?

MR. GREEN: Not necessarily, because, 

I mean, one other example if I might, Your 

Honor, would be not to conceal but to disclose. 

So, if I disclosed a witness list in a large

 multi-defendant drug trial, my purpose in doing 

that, though I haven't altered the document, 

would be to intimidate the witnesses or prevent

 their attendance.  That, on our submission,

 would also violate (c)(2). 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Can I 

just ask you one other question just so that I 

can fully understand your theory?  You keep 

using the term "evidence," and that does not 

appear in the statute.  The statute, (c)(1) says 

"record, document, or other object." 

Now I appreciate that, you know, 

evidence can be such a thing, but you can 

imagine a world in which those two are 

different.  So where does evidence come in in 

your theory and why is it there? 

MR. GREEN: Well, the -- the -- the 

title of the statute refers to tampering with 

witnesses, victims, and informants.  But along 

with wictims -- excuse me, witnesses, victims, 

and informants comes evidence that they provide,

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand. 

But the statute, the provision we're talking 

about here, does not use the term "evidence."

 And so -- and instead or in addition, it uses 

the term "official proceeding," which is

 elsewhere defined not in terms of, you know,

 court proceedings or investigations.  It's just 

a proceeding, you know, before Congress. 

So is it your -- is it your argument 

that the only thing that this provision covers 

is something that is tantamount to evidence in 

an investigation or trial? 

MR. GREEN: It -- it is, Your Honor. 

And we're not limiting it -- our -- our position 

does not limit it to documents or records. I 

would submit (c)(1), which we say carries into 

(c)(2) through the "otherwise" clause, when it 

says "other object," is pretty broad. 

And it need not be -- as -- as -- as

 "otherwise spoils evidence."

 And you're using it to say "otherwise 

spoils evidence" with, you know, "spoils" being

 all those verbs.  But it doesn't say that.  It

 says "otherwise obstructs a proceeding."  There 

are plenty of ways to write the statute that you

 want to write.  You could just say otherwise 

affects the integrity or availability of 

evidence in an official proceeding. You could 

combine official proceeding with evidence in 

other ways, you know, one with -- you could 

replicate the mens rea that (c)(1) has. 

I mean, there are ways in which (c)(2) 

-- multiple ways in which the drafters of (c)(2) 

could have made it clear that they intended 

(c)(2) to also operate only in the sphere of 

evidence spoliation.  But it doesn't do that. 

All it says is "otherwise obstructs, influences, 

or impedes." 

MR. GREEN: It -- it -- certainly, the 

statute could be written more precisely.  Any 

statute could be written more precisely. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's not a 

question of precisely.  The question is what is 

this "otherwise" -- this is what Justice Thomas

said at the beginning -- what is this

 "otherwise" taking from (c)(1)?  Of course, 

there's commonality that's involved in an

 "otherwise."  There's both commonality and

 difference.

 But what is the commonality that

 (c)(2) is drawing from (c)(1)?  It tells you 

what the commonality is. The commonality is

 that the things that fall into (c)(2) also have 

to obstruct, influence, or impede.  But what 

(c)(2) does not say, really does not say, is 

everything in (c)(2) also has to spoil evidence. 

MR. GREEN: But this Court has said 

that "otherwise" in a criminal statute means 

similar conduct, so we --

carrying out that similar conduct, which is 

obstruction of a proceeding. 

The statute tells you what the similar 

conduct is right on its face.

Justice Kagan, the statute tells you what the 

effect is. The conduct that's specified in

 And so a drafter of this statute could 

easily omit something like that and would omit 

something like that for the sake of economy and

 also to hedge because we know that what comes 

before might not be exactly the same as after, 

so we're not going to repeat what we said there, 

but we're going to use a connector like

 "otherwise" to -- to demonstrate that we're 

talking about similar conduct.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What's your best case 

for this, like, going backward and trying to

best case for sure.

You know, Begay said we look back at this other 

-- at this thing that Congress did, you know, 

did not use in the "otherwise" provision and we 

derive various things from it and we put it in. 

It was "purposeful, violent, and aggressive." 

And then, a few years later, we said, where did

 that come from?  We made it up, and we get rid 

of the whole thing.

 So that's not a great advertisement 

for rewriting a statute to -- to -- you know, to 

take an "otherwise" provision that says what it 

says and turn it into an "otherwise" provision 

that says something else. 

MR. GREEN: We would submit that Begay 

was abrogated on other grounds, Your Honor, and 

the other grounds are the Court -- the members 

of the Court could not decide between an 

assessment of the types of things that came 

before "otherwise" versus the level of risk. 

And when that began to play out in 

complicated cases like Chambers and many others 

involving escape from a halfway house, it became 

a -- an -- the Court said, an untenable 

proposition to figure out what a potential harm 

to another person might be looking at what came

MR. GREEN: That doesn't --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry, Mr. -- Mr.

 Green. Go ahead, finish your sentence.

 MR. GREEN: Yeah, but that doesn't --

that doesn't mean that the Court's holding about

 how to construe a statute and its significant

 holding about "otherwise" was abrogated in and 

of itself as a result of the cases that came 

after Begay. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I'm not a 

fan of Begay.  Some of us perceived at that time 

that there were problems, different problems, 

with what the Court did there. 

But I -- I think there -- there's a 

point in the colloquy that you've been having. 

The specific types of conduct that are 

enumerated in (1), alter, destroy, mutilate, 

conceal a record, document, et cetera, et 

cetera, have two things in common.  One, they 

all involve documents or objects, and they also 

all involve the impairment of the object's 

integrity or availability for use in an official 

proceeding.

So the similarity could be either of

 those things.  And so I -- I think that you may 

be biting off more than you can chew by

 suggesting, if -- if you are indeed suggesting, 

that the "otherwise" clause can only be read the 

way you read it. One might say it can certainly 

be read the way the government reads it, and 

that might even be the more straightforward

 reading. 

But it is also possible to read a 

clause like this more narrowly, and Judge Katsas 

provided an example of that in his opinion. If 

you have a statute that says anyone who kills or 

injures or assaults someone or otherwise causes 

serious injury, commits a crime, you wouldn't 

think that that applies to defamation. 

So it could be read your way. So then 

I think you have to go on to some other 

arguments and explain why your reading is better 

than the government's reading. 

MR. GREEN: Certainly. And I -- I 

would submit, Your Honor, that there are plenty 

of other reasons why our reading is the better 

reason.  And I'm not going to contest or bite

government's reading of (c)(2) is implausible.

 We think it's unsound, but it's 

unsound for the additional reasons that if one

 zooms out and looks at what the prohibited

 conduct is in 1512 generally, we are talking

 about interference or operation on forms of 

evidence and testimony that -- that obstruct a 

proceeding. That's what 12 is all about

 generally. 

And I would submit, Your Honor, too 

that as the briefing indicates, ejusdem generis

venerated Latin canons, also operate in our 

favor here, as well as the broader context of

Judge Katsas's opinion, as you did, in 

particular in the Joint Appendix at page 88, 

which lists out all of the different provisions

 in Section 1512.  Fifteen of the 21 would be 

subsumed by the government's reading of (c)(2).

 The government's reading of (c)(2), I 

remind the Court, is so broad that it would

 cover anyone who does something understanding 

that what they are doing is wrong in some way 

that in any way influence, impedes, or obstructs 

an official proceeding of any type.

everybody knew it was going to be superfluous 

because it was a provision that was meant to 

function as a backstop.  It was a later-enacted 

provision. Congress had all these statutes all 

over the place. It had just gone through Enron. 

What Enron convinced them of was that 

there were -- there were gaps in these statutes. 

And they tried to fill the gaps. They tried to 

fill the particular gap that they found out

about in Enron.  And then they said, you know, 

this is a lesson to us. There are probably

 other gaps in this statute.

 But they didn't know exactly what

 those gaps were.  So they said, let's have a

 backstop provision.  And this is their backstop 

provision. And, of course, in that circumstance 

-- I mean, superfluity is very often a good

 argument when it comes to statutory 

interpretation, but it's not a good argument 

when Congress is specifically devising a 

backstop provision to fill gaps that might 

exist -- they don't exactly know how they exist, 

but they think that they probably do exist -- in 

a preexisting statutory scheme.  And that's what 

this provision is intended to do. 

MR. GREEN: Respectfully, Your Honor, 

a close reading of Yates, both the majority 

opinion and the dissenting opinion, demonstrates 

that this Court thought that 1519 was the 

backstop.  That was supposed to be the omnibus 

provision.  And the Court was fighting over what 

the meaning of "tangible object" was in 1519. 

But that was meant to plug the hole that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I -- I 

have such a hard time with the superfluidity

 argument because this entire obstruction section

 is superfluidity.  There isn't one provision you

 can point to -- you just said it, you can point 

to 1512 and you have 1519, which says

 destruction of evidence.  How are they

 different?  They're really not.  You can point

 to any series -- any provision and point to 

superfluidity in this -- in this -- in this 

section, 1512 and otherwise. 

So we go back to Justice Kagan's 

position, which is what you don't have is a 

freestanding "otherwise obstructs, influence, or 

impedes any official proceeding."  I don't see 

why that's not the backstop that Congress would 

have intended and it's the language it used. 

MR. GREEN: Well, it's an awfully odd 

place to put it, isn't it, I mean, in a 

subsection of a subsection in the middle back of 

the statute, to -- to include a provision --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The one thing that

 Justice Kagan pointed to, which is clear, they 

wanted to cover every base, and they didn't do 

it in a logical way, but they managed to cover

 every base.

 MR. GREEN: Well, I think you can 

reconcile -- I mean, again, that's what the 

Court said about 1519 in -- in Yates.  And I 

don't understand how it is that the government 

can come before you today and say we need yet 

another catchall, yet another omnibus crime that 

will sweep in all kinds of others.  We didn't 

get what we wanted in Section 15, so now we'll 

go to 1512(c)(2) and see if we can expand that 

in this way to cover something that it has never 

covered before.

Courthouse problems in -- in -- in -- in -- in 

Portland, Oregon.  But let's -- let's also look 

at what the Court has said in so many different

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, there, there 

was a difference in the use of words.  Here, 

"otherwise obstructs, influences, or impede," 

you might have a problem with breadth.  And the 

government can address that.  But it's not 

unclear what those words mean.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If it were just 

the language in (c)(2) and so said "whoever

 corruptly obstructs, influences, or impedes," 

(c)(2), without the word "otherwise," if that

 were the whole provision, do you acknowledge 

that the language would then be applied properly 

to a situation like this? 

MR. GREEN: Unfortunately, no, and the 

reason for that is that, again, applying all the 

other canons and -- and applying the whole-text 

canon and zooming out and looking at the -- at 

1512, we would submit that (c)(2) should still 

be read in the way we have suggested that it be 

read, as something that is an evidence 

impairment statute. 

I think also, as I mentioned, the 

Latin canons, the surplusage problem that (c)(2) 

would create, all of those would still obtain if 

it sat there by itself without the "otherwise." 

The "otherwise" is the icing on the cake.

being what the Court adopts when there's an

but, if you -- if you do the operation that I 

talked about earlier, which is we're just going

 to use "otherwise" to replace the verbs and the

 nouns in (c)(1), then -- then the statute makes

 perfect sense.

 With respect to intent, I mean, I

 think Your Honor makes an excellent point, which 

is that this intent is a specific form of

 intent.  The "corruptly," which has been

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I'm just still

 wondering if your theory about this provision 

might be too narrow in a sense because you've 

got evidence going and spoliation in a sense.

 What I -- what I'm trying to work out

 in my mind is whether you would still have a 

decent argument if this 1512 language is read to 

prohibit the corrupt tampering with things that 

are used to conduct a -- an official proceeding 

with the intent of undermining the integrity of 

the thing or access to the thing and thereby 

obstructing the proceeding. 

It's not just evidence.  It's an 

official proceeding.  (c)(1) is an example of, 

you know, the corrupt tampering with certain 

things.  And (c)(2) broadens it out a bit.  It's 

not just documents and records. 

What do you think about that? 

MR. GREEN: Well, I think -- I think 

that's -- that's a correct reading, Your Honor. 

I mean, we're -- is -- as -- as 1512(f) 

demonstrates, it doesn't -- you know, 1512(f) we 

would submit actually supports our position 

because it says the evidence need not be

 Justice Barrett posits a scenario in

 which you have someone who is impairing the

 availability by doing something to prevent the 

object from getting to the proceeding. Why

 wouldn't that count under (c)(2)?

 So this is -- this is, you know, 

preventing Congress from counting the electoral 

votes, for example.  Let's say it's being done. 

She says it's in an envelope going to the -- the 

vice president's desk and someone does something 

to impair or prevent that from happening.  Why

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 On January 6th, 2021, a violent mob 

stormed the United States Capitol and disrupted 

the peaceful transition of power. Many crimes 

occurred that day, but in plain English, the 

fundamental wrong committed by many of the 

rioters, including Petitioner, was a deliberate 

attempt to stop the joint session of Congress 

from certifying the results of the election. 

That is, they obstructed Congress's work in that 

official proceeding. 

The government accordingly charged 

Petitioner with violating Section 1512(c)(2), an 

obstruction offense that directly reads onto his 

conduct. 

The case as it comes to this Court 

presents a straightforward question of statutory 

interpretation:  Did Petitioner obstruct, 

influence, or impede the joint session of 

Congress? 

The answer is equally straightforward. 

Yes, he obstructed that official proceeding.

The terms of the statute unambiguously encompass

 his conduct.  Petitioner doesn't really argue

 that his actions fall outside the plain meaning 

of what it is to obstruct. Instead, he asks

 this Court to impose an -- atextual limit on the

 actus reus.  In his view, because Section 

1512(c)(1) covers tampering with documents and

 other physical evidence, the separate 

prohibition in Section 1512(c)(2) should be 

limited to acts of evidence impairment. 

But that limit has no basis in the 

text or tools of construction.  His reading 

hinges on the word "otherwise," but that word 

means in a different manner, not in the same 

manner.  And the two prohibitions in Section 

1512(c)(2) aren't unified items on a list where 

you could apply associated words canons. 

They're separate provisions.  They have their 

own sets of verbs and their own nouns.  They 

each independently prohibit attempts, which 

would be duplication that makes no sense on 

Petitioner's reading.  And Congress included a 

distinct mental state requirement in (c)(1) that 

it chose not to repeat in (c)(2). 

Section 1512(c)(2) by its terms is not

 limited to evidence impairment.  Instead, it's a

 classic catchall.  (c)(1) covers specified acts

 that obstruct an official proceeding, and (c)(2) 

covers all other acts that obstruct an official

 proceeding in a different manner.  The Court 

should say so and allow this case to proceed to

 trial. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, there have 

been many violent protests that have interfered 

with proceedings.  Has the government applied 

this provision to other protests in the past, 

and has this been the government's position 

throughout the lifespan of this statute? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It has certainly 

been the -- the government's position since the 

enactment of 1512(c)(2) that it covers the 

myriad forms of obstructing an official 

proceeding and that it's not limited to some 

kind of evidence impairment gloss.  With --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Have you -- so have

Official 

Now I can't give you an example of 

enforcing it in a situation where people have 

violently stormed a building in order to prevent 

an official proceeding, a specified one, from

 occurring with all of the elements like intent

 to obstruct, knowledge of the proceeding, having

 the corruptly mens rea, but -- but that's just

 because I'm not aware of that circumstance ever

 happening prior to January 6th. 

But just to give you a flavor of some 

of the other circumstances where we have 

prosecuted under this provision, for example, 

there are situations where we've brought (c)(2) 

charges because someone tipped off the subject 

of an investigation to the grand jury's 

hearings.  There was another case where someone 

tipped off about the identity of an undercover 

law enforcement officer. 

And in those situations, there's no 

specific evidence, no, you know, concrete 

testimony or physical evidence that the conduct 

is interfering with.  Instead, it's more general 

obstruction of the proceeding. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So --

mentioned the Reich case as well, and that's 

another one where it was a forged court order 

that prompted the litigant to dismiss a mandamus 

petition. But that didn't have anything to do 

with the evidence that was going to be

 considered in that proceeding. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: So what role does 

(c)(1) play in your analysis?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So we understand 

1512(c) to split up the world of obstructive 

conduct of an official proceeding into the 

(c)(1) offense and into (c)(2).  (c)(1) covers 

everything it enumerates.  It's the acts of 

altering, concealing, destroying records, 

documents, or other objects.  And then (c)(2) 

would only pick up conduct that obstructs an 

official proceeding in a different way. 

So there's no duplication or 

superfluity on our reading.  Instead, Congress 

was taking this universe and dividing it up into 

the two separate offenses. 

And I think that's actually a virtue 

of our reading as compared to Petitioner's 

because I have not heard him articulate anything 

that would fall within (c)(1) that wouldn't also

really does just swallow (c)(1) whole.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, I mean, in the 

way you're reading it, (c)(1) -- (c)(2) almost 

exists in isolation, certainly not affected by

 (c)(1).

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We don't deny at

 all that there is a relationship between the two 

provisions, Justice Thomas, but it's --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What is that 

relationship? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And the 

relationship is the one Congress specified in 

the text.  It's what follows the word 

"otherwise."  That is the relevant degree of 

similarity.  What both (c)(1) and (c)(2) have in 

common is that they -- they aim at conduct that 

obstructs an official proceeding.  (c)(1) does 

so in one way, tampering with records and 

documents; (c)(2) does so with respect to all 

other conduct that in a different manner does 

that. 

And I think that this has to be the 

road the Court goes down to look at what 

Congress actually prescribed with respect to

similarity because, in contrast, if you take up 

Petitioner's invitation to come up with some

 atextual gloss from (c)(1) to port over into 

(c)(2), I don't understand what the Court could 

look at to guide its determination of exactly 

what the relevant similarity would be.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yeah --

General, I'm sure you've had a chance to read 

our opinion released Friday in the Bissonnette 

case. It was unanimous.  It was very short. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it 

explained how to apply the doctrine of ejusdem 

generis, and -- and it -- what it said is that 

specific terms, a more general catchall, if you 

will, term at the end, and it said that the 

general phrase is controlled and defined by 

reference to the terms that precede it. 

The "otherwise" phrase is more 

general, and the terms that precede it are 

"alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a 

record [and] document." 

And applying the doctrine as was set 

forth in that opinion, the specific terms 

"alters, destroy, and mutilate" carry forward

into (2), and the terms "record, document, or

 other object" carry -- carry forward into (2) as

 well, and it seems to me that they, as I said, 

sort of control and defined the -- the more

 general term.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, Mr. Chief

 Justice, I think that the statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I'm sorry.

 Just to interrupt --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Oh, yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- so I could 

put out exactly what -- and -- and the 

"otherwise" means in other ways. It alters, 

destroys, and mutilates record, document, or 

other objects that impede the investigation and 

otherwise, in other ways, accomplishes the same 

result. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think the 

problem with that approach with respect to 1512 

is that it doesn't look like the typical kind of 

statutory phrase that consists of a parallel 

list of nouns or a parallel -- list of verbs 

where the Court has applied ejusdem generis or 

the noscitur canon.

prohibitions that have their own complex,

 non-parallel internal structure. And I think,

 actually, the best evidence that it's hard to 

figure out how you would divine a degree of 

similarity between them just based on the word 

"otherwise" is that there -- there are multiple

 competing interpretations at issue in this case. 

You know, Justice Alito touched on them, and 

they're reflected in the competing 

interpretations between Judge Katsas on the D.C. 

Circuit and Judge Nichols on the district court. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Competing 

interpretations of what, which phrase? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So -- and it 

relates to exactly the -- the question you asked 

me, which is that Judge Nichols thought that 

(c)(1) should limit (c)(2), and he looked at it 

and said, well, the relevant thing about (c)(1) 

is it deals with records, documents, and other 

objects, and so that means (c)(2) should be 

limited only to other acts that impair physical 

evidence. 

Meanwhile, Judge Katsas looked at the 

specific intent requirement in (c)(1), to take 

action that impairs the availability or use of

the evidence, and he divined a broader gloss to

 put on (c)(2) and said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but

 that's simply saying --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- it should be

 other impairment of all other evidence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they're 

just applying the same doctrine to different

 aspects of it. And I think you do that as -- as 

well. What are the common elements?  Alters, 

destroy, and mutilates a record or document. 

You have the first few, what you're doing, and 

what you're doing it to. 

And you -- and you apply both of those 

in -- as it said in Bissonnette, controlling and 

defining the term that follows so that it should 

involve something that's capable of alteration, 

destruction, and mutilation and -- and with 

respect to a record or a document.  That --

that's how you -- that's why --

when you apply that doctrine, again, as we did

concerns that have been raised about how broad

 (c)(2) is. You can't just tack it on and say 

look at it as if it's standing alone because

 it's not.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So let me respond 

to that in two ways. I do want to have a chance

 to address any concerns about breadth.  But the 

-- the more fundamental point, I think, is that 

I don't even understand Petitioner to be 

suggesting that you can mix and match the verbs 

and the nouns from (c)(1) and (c)(2) in this 

way. 

Judge Nichols had a more limited view 

that it -- that (c)(2) exclusively focuses on 

physical objects.  It wouldn't apply to things 

like testimony because of the limitation that he 

gleaned from (c)(1).  Judge Katsas, I think, 

maybe in line with your question, would 

interpret it more broadly. 

And the -- the basic point as a 

textual matter is that there is nothing in the 

text of (c)(2) itself to disclose what the 

relevant similarity from (c)(1) ought to be. 

Instead, we think the relevant similarity is 

obstruction of an official proceeding because

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  General --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- if that's -- if

 that's -- if that's the case, what work does 

"otherwise" do on your theory? Because I think

 I -- I might, as I'm hearing you, think that 

"whoever [...] corruptly obstructs, influences, 

or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts 

to do so" stands alone.  And the "otherwise" --

I'm not hearing what work it does.  Can you 

explain to me what work it does on your view? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So the work 

that "otherwise" does is to set up the 

relationship between (c)(1) and (c)(2) and make 

clear that (c)(2) does not cover the conduct 

that's encompassed by (c)(1). 

Now I acknowledge that there would 

have been --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Beyond that --

beyond that, beyond saying, okay, (c)(1) does 

some things and the whole rest of the universe 

of obstructing, impeding, or -- or influencing 

is conducted by (c)(2).  Is that a fair summary 

of your view?

 wouldn't be something the government could

 charge or prove as 1512(c)(2) beyond a

the requirement that the defendant's conduct be 

wrongful and committed with consciousness of

 wrongdoing.  And this traces to the Court's 

decision in Arthur Andersen, where the Court 

said this is a term with deep historical roots, 

with a settled meaning, and that it connotes not 

just knowledge of your actions, which is, you

 know, the intent to obstruct in this case, but

 further requires that it be done corruptly. 

And just to give you a more concrete 

example of how this has played out in the 

January 6th prosecutions, I'd point to the jury 

instruction in the Robertson case, which we 

refer to and quote in part on page 44 of our 

brief. There, the jury was instructed that in 

order to show the defendant acted corruptly, the 

jury had to -- to conclude that he had an 

unlawful purpose or used unlawful means or both 

and that he had consciousness of wrongdoing. 

So I think that that is an 

encapsulation of what the jury is asked to 

decide on top of the mere intent to obstruct.

you a -- an -- a specific example which is --

with respect to one of the -- the examples that

 Justice Gorsuch provided.

 So we've had a number of protests in

 the courtroom.  Let's say that today, while 

you're arguing or Mr. Green is arguing, five 

people get up, one after the other, and they 

shout either "Keep the January 6th

 insurrectionists in jail" or "Free the January 

6th patriots." And as a result of this, our 

police officers have to remove them forcibly 

from the courtroom and let's say we have to --

it delays the proceeding for five minutes. 

And I know that experienced advocates 

like you and Mr. Green are not going to be 

flustered by that, but, you know, in another 

case, an advocate might lose his or her train of 

thought and not provide the best argument. 

So would that be a violation of 

1512(c)(2)? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: I think it would be 

difficult for the government to prove that. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  At the outset, we 

don't think that 1512(c)(2) picks up minimal, de 

minimis, minor interferences.  We think that the

"impede" in Webster's is "to interfere with" or 

get in the way of the progress of, to hold up. 

In the OED, it is "to retard in progress or

So it doesn't require obstruction. It 

requires the causing of delay.

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, again, why

 wouldn't that fall within -- now you -- you can 

say, well, we're not going to prosecute that. 

And, indeed, for all the protests that have 

occurred in this Court, the Justice Department 

has not charged any serious offenses, and I 

don't think any one of those protestors has been

 sentenced to even one day in prison.  But why 

isn't that a violation of 512 -- of 1512(c)(2)? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We read the actus 

reus more narrowly.  Now perhaps you could look 

at some of the broader dictionary definitions 

and adopt a broader understanding of the actus 

reus. Still, there would be the backstop of 

needing to prove corrupt intent. I think that's 

a stringent mens rea, and in the concept of --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's not a 

corrupt intent?  They -- they -- it's wrongful. 

Do you think it's not wrongful to --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I could imagine 

defendants in that scenario suggesting that they 

thought they had some protected free speech 

right to protest.  They might say that they 

weren't conscious of the fact that they weren't

 allowed to make that kind of brief protest in

 the Court. 

And I think it's in a fundamentally

 different posture than if they had stormed into 

this courtroom, overrun the Supreme Court 

police, required the Justices and other

 participants to plea -- flee for their safety, 

and done so with clear evidence of intent to

 obstruct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well -- yes indeed, 

absolutely.  What happened on January 6th was 

very, very serious, and I'm not equating this 

with that.  But we need to find out what -- what 

are the outer reaches of this statute under your 

interpretation. 

Let me give you another example. 

Yesterday protestors blocked the Golden Gate 

Bridge in San Francisco and disrupted traffic in 

San Francisco.  What if something similar to 

that happened all around the Capitol so that 

members -- all the bridges from Virginia were 

blocked, and members from Virginia who needed to 

appear at a hearing couldn't get there or were 

delayed in getting there?  Would that be a 

violation of this provision?

But still, the Court has required a 

nexus, and that's been the requirement in cases 

like Marinello, Aguilar, and -- and Arthur

narrowing work because you have to show that the

 But, Justice Alito, the other thing I

 would say to this set of concerns is that there

 are other obstruction provisions, including in

 1503, 1505, the tax obstruction statute, 7212, 

that use this exact same formulation that the

 Court has characterized as an omnibus clause and

 never suggested could be subject to an evidence

 gloss. 

So I don't think that to the extent 

you have concerns about those hypotheticals, 

your -- your question about what would happen in 

this courtroom could be covered by 1503. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  And interpreting 

this statute ordinarily --

the purpose of causing unnecessary delay or

 needlessly increasing the cost of litigation.

 And in a particular case, the judge

 imposes Article -- Rule 11 sanctions and says,

 this caused a lot of trouble.  I can tell you

 it -- it -- it caused at least five work days

 with -- for me personally, all of this 

unnecessary paper, and it delayed the progress 

of this litigation, so I'm imposing Rule 11 

sanctions. 

Why doesn't that fall within your 

interpretation of this provision? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Congress created a 

specific safe harbor in 1515(c). It's reprinted 

at page 17A to the appendix of our brief that 

specifies that advocacy or legal representation 

that is conducted as part of a proceeding 

shouldn't be understood as obstruction. 

So I think Congress was itself trying 

to draw some lines around participation in a 

proceeding on the one hand versus external 

forces that obstruct the proceeding on the other 

hand. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It falls within -- but

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So the January 6th 

prosecutions require us to show first that the 

defendants had knowledge that Congress was 

meeting in the joint session on that day. We 

have to show that the defendant specifically 

intended to disrupt the joint proceeding. 

And then, with respect to using 

unlawful means with consciousness of wrongdoing, 

we have focused on things like the defendant's 

threats of violence, willingness to use violence 

here. We allege that Petitioner assaulted a 

police officer.  We have focused on things like 

preparation for violence, bringing tactical gear 

or paramilitary equipment to the Capitol. 

And I want to emphasize, Justice 

Kagan, that this is a stringent mens rea

 1,350 defendants with crimes committed on 

January 6th, but we've only had the -- only had 

the evidence of intent to bring charges against

 350 for a 1512(c)(2) violation.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So how do you make 

that decision? How do you decide which 

defendants get charged under this statute as 

opposed to not? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The dividing line 

has hinged usually on the evidence we have of 

intent.  So we're looking for clear evidence the 

-- defendant knew about the proceedings that 

were happening in the joint session in Congress 

that day, clear knowledge of the official 

proceeding. 

We've looked for evidence that the 

defendant specifically intended to -- to prevent 

Congress from certifying the vote and so used 

his actions to obstruct that proceeding. 

And then also, as I had mentioned, the

conduct can come about with respect to 

particular preparations that the defendants have

made.

 And, you know, there are a number of

 cases where, even though we thought we had the 

evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, there have

 been acquittals because there was, you know,

 testimony that was credited that the defendant 

thought the proceedings were over and wasn't

 intending to obstruct, or one person thought and 

said he thought that law enforcement was waving 

him into the building. 

So even in situations where we think 

we have amassed the evidence, we still haven't 

always been able to sustain these convictions, 

and it's because of the stringent mens rea. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  General, can I ask 

you about your obstruction theory because you 

said that you see 1512(c) as dividing the world 

of obstruction and that the -- the nexus between 

(1) and (2) is the official proceeding and the 

obstruction of -- of -- of an official 

proceeding. 

I guess what I'm concerned about is 

how you then account for the rest of 1512, where

as obstructing the official proceeding, like 

killing or threatening or intimidating

 witnesses, is covered so that if we read (c)(2)

 to be obstructing a -- an official proceeding, I

 don't -- I don't understand what happens to the

 rest of those provisions.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So, to the extent

 you're pressing on the idea that there's

 surplusage, I -- I don't think that that's true. 

There is certainly overlap or duplication. 

That's true on both of the readings in this 

case. 

I think, in -- in part, it might even 

be more true on Petitioner's reading because he 

says that (c)(2) is likewise focused on all of 

the evidence impairment ways to obstruct, 

interfering with testimony, interfering with 

documents and so forth, and so that very same 

duplication is going to be present on his 

reading. 

But, with respect to superfluity, our 

interpretation doesn't create any technical 

superfluity, and that's because each of those 

other provisions that you cited and -- and, in 

fact, each of the other provisions of the

obstruction laws cover situations that

 1512(c)(2) wouldn't cover.

 There are three principal

 distinctions.  The first is that some of them

 have less than a corruptly mens rea.  So, for 

many of the provisions, they can be violated in 

ways that wouldn't require the government to 

prove "corruptly," and it might mean that we 

could charge particular applications of those 

provisions under them and not under (c)(2). 

The second thing is that some of the 

provisions sweep more broadly than an official 

proceeding.  They apply in a wider range of 

circumstances.  So that would enable us to 

charge in those situations where we can't 

actually prove the official proceeding element. 

And then, third and finally, some of 

the provisions have a -- a higher penalty 

specifically because they target more culpable 

conduct.  And that's like 1512(a), the one you 

referenced about killing a witness.  There, the 

government would charge under that provision 

because it's subject to higher penalties than 

(c)(2).

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So there's no

 actual superfluity.

 JUSTICE JACKSON: -- can I ask you,

 would the -- would the government necessarily 

lose in the sense that they would not be able to

 bring charges against some of the people that 

you have described with Justice Kagan if we 

looked at (c)(2) as being more limited, perhaps 

not all the way to evidence, but related to 

conduct that prevents or obstructs an official 

proceeding insofar as it is directed to 

preventing access to information or documents or 

records or things that the official proceeding 

would use? 

I -- I explored with Mr. Green, and --

and as did Justice Barrett, the idea that to the 

extent that there were people who knew that the 

votes were being counted that day and that's 

done in a, you know, documentary way in our 

system, their interfering by storming the 

Capitol might qualify under even an evidence or 

document interpretation of (c)(2).

 think about that?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, I think that 

if the Court articulated the standard that way,

 these would likely be viable charges.  And as we 

note in the last footnote of our brief, we --

 we've preserved an argument that we could

 satisfy even an evidence-related understanding 

of (c)(2), in part because the very point of the

 conduct, when we have the intent evidence, was 

to prevent Congress from being able to count the 

votes, from being able to actually certify the 

results of the election. 

Now we'd obviously need to evaluate 

whether these charges can go forward based on 

whatever this Court says, and I would very much 

caution the Court away from any holding that 

would require specific evidence by the 

government of, you know, precise electoral 

certificates or that kind of thing. 

Here, the -- the point of it would be 

that the -- those who came to the Capitol and 

engaged in this criminal conduct to displace 

Congress violently from -- from where it had to 

be to count those votes acted with an intent to 

impair Congress's ability to consider that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, the 

district court and the dissent below had a

 different variation on the statute and how to 

read it. You were starting to explain that to

 Could you do it if we accepted the

 district court's view? I -- I presume that you 

could do it if we accepted the dissent below, 

correct?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah.  But your 

whole response to Justice Ketanji -- to Justice

it -- it assumes the dissent's view? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I thought that 

Justice Jackson was potentially proposing even a 

broader view, including focusing on the 

availability part and making clear that when the 

whole point is to prevent the proceeding, 

including the consideration of evidence in the 

proceeding, from happening, that could qualify.

view and especially harder on the Judge Nichols

 view, and that's precisely because Judge --

 Judge Nichols seemed to think that to prove 

obstruction, it had to be limited to taking 

action with respect to the documents themselves. 

And that would be a difficult standard for us to

 satisfy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You read our

 discussion on "corruptly" yesterday.  It's 

clear. You've endorsed the Robertson view. 

Could you tell me what you feel about 

the Walker view? Judge Walker being part of the 

majority below.  I -- I assume you know that, 

but --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  So Judge 

Walker articulated an idea that "corruptly" has 

to turn exclusively on the government being able 

to show that the defendant sought to secure an 

unlawful advantage for himself or someone else. 

We certainly agree that that's one way 

for the government to prove corrupt intent. 

It's a way that has traditionally been deployed 

in the tax context because the very theory of 

the case is that the defendant is violating the 

tax laws or taking efforts to secure an unlawful

 advantage under the tax laws.

 But I think that it would be incorrect 

for the Court to suggest that that's the 

exclusive mechanism for the government to try to

 prove "corruptly."  You know, there are various 

other ways where we might have evidence of, as 

we think we do here, unlawful means, committed 

with consciousness of wrongdoing, and there's no 

basis in the common law or in how the term 

"corruptly" has long been understood to limit 

the government's ability to prove it only with 

that one specific way that Judge Walker pointed 

to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The draw in this 

case appears to be the fear that reading the 

government's view of either yesterday's case or 

today on its plain terms would make it so broad 

that somehow that presents a problem.  I think 

the judges below struggled with that by saying 

that gets addressed in the word "corruptly" and 

in the nexus requirement, which is the point 

you've made today. 

But neither of those two issues were 

resolved below because that wasn't the question 

below, correct?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.  The 

only issue that the D.C. Circuit resolved was 

the meaning of the actus reus.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the only issue

 between us is whether we read the words -- how

 we read these words?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right, but I 

don't want to lose sight of the fact, as your 

question touched on, that there are inherent 

constraints built into the other elements of the 

statute.  The nexus constraint is a really 

critical one.  It is the -- the paradigmatic 

constraint the Court has pointed to to ensure 

that obstruction statutes don't sweep too 

broadly and scoop up everyday conduct that might 

be happening out in the world. 

It has to have that tight connection, 

the relationship in time, causation, or logic, 

with the official proceeding.  And, of course, 

"corruptly," we think, sets a very high bar, as 

evidenced by the fact as, as I said to Justice 

Kagan, it's not like we can even prove it with 

respect to everyone who was in the riot at the

JUSTICE BARRETT:  General, are you 

putting a violence requirement as an overlay on

 "obstruct, influence, impede"?  And I'm -- I'm 

thinking of some of your answers to Justice

 Alito's hypotheticals.  It seemed like you kept

 emphasizing the aspect of violence that was

 present on January 6th.  So am -- am I 

understanding you to say there has to be some 

sort of violence or no? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, we don't think 

that's a requirement under the statute.  I think 

it will clearly be easier for us to satisfy 

things like the corruptly mens rea when we can 

point to action here, like assaulting a police 

officer, that is obviously wrongful, unlawful 

conduct, and everyone knows that that's a crime 

and you cannot do that. 

What I was trying to say to Justice 

Alito is, in situations where hypotheticals 

press on the idea that people are engaging in 

conduct that maybe they think is 

constitutionally protected, they might be wrong 

about that, there might not be a First Amendment 

right that they think they have, but that can 

demonstrate that they don't have the requisite

 couldn't prove an obstruction charge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

 counsel.

 I'm not quite sure I understood an 

answer you gave earlier about whether or not

 you've previously used (c)(2) in -- in this type

 of case.  Have -- have you done that before or

 not? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We have charged 

(c)(2) in situations that don't involve evidence 

impairment, and the litigating position of the 

Department has long been that, as its plain 

language suggests, it covers myriad ways of 

obstructing.  I'm not aware of any other factual 

circumstance or event out in the world where we 

could have proved all of the elements of Section 

1512(c)(2) beyond the cases where we've brought 

those prosecutions.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- and 

just so I understand, the prosecutions are 

limited in what way? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  They're limited to 

a requirement that the specific people had in 

mind an official proceeding.  So that would take

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- where, you know,

 maybe you're protesting a branch of government, 

you're outside this Court, but you don't have

 this specific argument in mind.

you know, situations where maybe someone's --

in the case but is just prompting the litigant 

to dismiss a pending mandamus petition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and

 your friend's point -- your friend points to an 

Office of Legal Counsel opinion from 2019 that 

-- I haven't looked at it yet, but I will --

that says it is consistent with Judge Katsas's

 opinion below.  You --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So that -- that 

advice that was offered to the Attorney General 

and never adopted as a formal position of the 

Department of Justice related to distinct issues 

that arose out of the special counsel 

investigation and distinct issues that involved 

the Office of the Presidency. 

I don't think that it would be right 

to suggest that the memo took any firm stand, 

although it did suggest that maybe 1512(c)(2) 

should be understood more narrowly, but it 

didn't -- it certainly didn't represent any 

formal adoption of that position, and that would 

have been inconsistent with how the government 

has always litigated under (c)(2).

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I should probably 

know the answer to that one as a matter of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, I should

 too, but --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- of DOJ policy,

 but what -- what I can tell you is the reason 

I'm saying that wasn't an official position is 

because it specifically said there's no need to 

go down the road of even deciding exactly what 

1512(c)(2) covers because, even assuming that it 

covers the full range of obstructive conduct, 

the allegations, according to the memo, didn't 

satisfy the standard there.  So it ultimately 

just punted on the issue and said it's not 

necessary to engage with that issue further. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 

Justice Thomas? 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  General, the -- you 

said, as I understand it, that you have applied 

(c)(2) in previous cases? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's right.

evidence impairment model that Petitioner is 

urging on the Court here.  And it's not just

 not clear as to whether or not -- the specific 

instances in which you have used (c)(2) because 

you seem to think that (c) -- or argue that 

(c)(2) is a standalone provision almost. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  We think that it 

covers the full range of obstructive conduct 

that's not covered by (c)(1), of course, limited 

by the requirement of an official proceeding. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So, if -- if you have 

applied (c)(2), have there been previous, other 

than the D.C. Circuit, previous courts of 

appeals that have looked at this? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  And the 

uniform consensus among the court of appeals has 

been that (c)(2) is not limited by this kind of 

evidence impairment gloss that Petitioner is 

asking the Court to read into the statute.

There has been no court of appeals that's gone

 the other way.  We cite a string cite of them 

that have recognized looking at the plain 

language of this provision that it sweeps in the

 myriad forms of obstructive conduct.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So much of your 

argument seems to hinge on this being fairly

 clear, the -- the -- your interpretation of

 (c)(2). 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, we certainly 

think we have the best of the plain text. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. If we think --

if -- if -- if -- if I happen to think it's more 

ambiguous, what would your argument be? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So what I would say 

is I think that if you look at the terms in the 

statute themselves, that the plain language of 

the statute supports our view, but it doesn't 

end there.  And I was -- I have mentioned 

several times the other provisions in 1503, 

1505, but we think that's actually really 

relevant because Congress wasn't writing on a 

blank slate when it enacted 1512(c)(2).

influences, or impedes." That wasn't taken out

 of the ether.  That was a well-established term, 

verb phrase, in obstruction law drawn from those

 other statutes.

 And as this Court has said many times, 

when Congress takes a phrase like that, it 

brings the old soil with it. And so Congress 

would have clearly known that the courts, this

 Court and lower courts, had interpreted the 

omnibus clause in those other statutes to 

encompass the full range of obstructive conduct. 

That's also consistent with all 

precedent, as I mentioned to you earlier, so I 

think, when you put it all together, there's no 

real ambiguity here.  We -- we clearly have the 

best reading. 

And the only other thing, the icing on 

the cake if I could --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Yeah. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  -- is that if, 

actually, what Congress wanted to do was write a

 It would not have used this oblique 

reference of "otherwise" and then used a term 

that had a well-settled meaning in obstruction 

law to sweep more broadly to try to convey that

 type of limited scope.  It would just be

 nonsensical for Congress to draft that way 

because it would be so readily misunderstood. 

And, in fact, every lower court has understood 

Congress to have legislated more broadly here. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But that's beginning 

to sound more like a contextual argument, which 

you seem to eschew in this case. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, no, I -- I 

think, actually, that the statutory context and 

history does bear weight here, and we think that 

the roots of this language in those other 

obstruction provisions help fortify or reinforce 

how the Court has always understood the plain 

language. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You argue that there's 

a -- an exception for conduct that has only a 

minimal effect on official proceedings.  Where 

does that come from in the text?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That comes from the 

verb phrase "obstruct, influence, or impede," 

which we think, if you look at dictionary

 definitions, conveys the type of action that 

blocks, hinders, makes difficult, persistently 

interferes with. You know, this is the kind of 

-- the verbs themselves, we think, inherently

 contain this limitation.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  There can't be a minor 

impediment? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think as a 

colloquial matter, yes, maybe, but, you know, I 

-- we think that if you look at what Congress 

was trying to do as a whole, the lead term here 

is "obstruct."  These were various ways of 

trying to capture the world of obstructive 

conduct, and I think that that adequately 

conveys the idea that some kind of very minimal, 

de minimis interference doesn't qualify. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it didn't stop 

with "obstruct."  It -- it added "impede." 

But what is the meaning of -- how 

would you define a -- a minimal interference?  I 

suppose a jury would have to be charged on that.

committed more than, caused, or intended to

 cause more than a minimal interference.

 How do you define it?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think, you 

know, to the extent that this would come up in

 actual prosecutions -- and I'm not aware of

 any -- but, if this came up, then I think that 

it would be the defense theory, it's possible 

that the Court could decide it as a matter of 

law if, in fact, it was so minimal it doesn't 

fit within the statutory terms themselves. 

And I recognize that maybe there could 

be gray areas about the nature of the 

obstruction and whether it really satisfies the 

actus reus.  I think that is properly a subject 

for the jury. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  What about 

the example I gave you about the five protestors 

in the courtroom?  Is that minimal? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR: I think that sounds 

minimal to me. I mean, it sounds to me like, if 

it hasn't actually forced any substantial halt 

to these proceedings, it seems like that 

wouldn't pick up and track.  But, you know, this

-- the same issue would arise under 1503, which

 likewise refers to "obstruct, influence, or

 impede."

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You haven't said

 anything about the surplusage arguments.  Let me 

just ask you a question or two about that. 

Suppose someone commits conduct that

 falls squarely within 1512(d), the person

 intentionally harasses another person and 

therefore dissuades that person from attending 

or testifying in an official proceeding.  So 

you've got a square -- you know, a clear 

violation of 1512(d) punishable by no more than 

three years in prison. 

But, when Congress added 1512(c)(2), 

which seems to cover exactly that conduct, it 

said: Well, the punishment shouldn't be -- you 

could punish that person for up to 20 years. 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  There's a key 

difference between 1512(d) and 1512(c) in that 

(d) doesn't require the intent to obstruct.  And 

so the effect of the defendant's harassment 

action is to prevent the testimony or the 

production of the document. 

But the government has not read that

statute to require an actual intent to obstruct,

 which I think means there are certain factual 

scenarios where the government might be able to

 prove a 1512(d) offense without satisfying

 (c)(2).  But I do want to be responsive to the

 broader concern that there's something anomalous

 about the 20-year penalty here.

 Let me say at the outset that no 

matter which statute the -- the government 

charges under, with respect to all of the 

relevant obstruction statutes here, they would 

be funneled through the same sentencing 

guideline.  So the charging decision wouldn't 

make a difference with respect to the sentencing 

range. 

And the concern you have with the 

hypothetical arises equally on Petitioner's 

reading because so too everything that would be 

covered in 1512(d) falls within his evidence 

impairment limitation.  So I don't think the 

existence of a statutory max when there's no 

mandatory minimum should drive intuitions about 

how to interpret this provision. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm not sure 

that's the correct interpretation of -- of

 How about 1512(b), which also has a

 20-year penalty, but it seems to be completely

 subsumed by (c)(2).

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I think there is a 

lot of overlap between (b) and (c). I -- I

 don't deny that.  Again, that would be true on 

either reading because (b) is paradigmatic

 witness tampering.  And so, even on Petitioner's 

understanding of the statute, there would be 

equal duplication there. 

What I would say is there's no actual 

superfluity because there are ways of violating 

(b) that wouldn't fall within our understanding 

of (c)(2), including acting in a misleading 

manner towards someone, which wouldn't 

necessarily satisfy a corrupt intent definition. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Really?  You think you 

could knowingly threaten or corruptly 

persuade -- corruptly mislead someone?  I -- I 

don't understand that argument.

is that there are multiple different means of 

carrying out that offense.  Of course, something

whether an adverse employment action has to be 

significant or not. 

And you said no, it doesn't have to be 

significant because, "The text likewise admits 

of no distinction between discrimination that 

results in a significant or insignificant 

disadvantage." 

So, in Muldrow, you told us no, don't 

read in an atextual requirement of significance,

got to read in an atextual requirement of

 something that's more than minimal.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Green referred a

that's supposed to be the catchall provision, 

the omnibus provision.  You know, why are you 

asking 1512 to do the same thing that 1519 is 

supposed to do?  So that's one question I have 

for you.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  If -- if we go down

 Mr. Green's road in terms of importing other 

limits from other places in the statute, are any

 of those likely to be challenged in the same 

kind of way, or are they written sufficiently 

differently so that we wouldn't have to worry 

about that? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So let me take the 

questions in order. 

With respect to Petitioner's reliance 

on 1519 as the catchall here, I understood the 

Court's decision in Yates to say precisely the 

opposite.  In fact, Yates drew a direct 

comparison between 1519 on the one hand, which 

it said was a more narrow obstruction provision 

based on some of the contextual clues there, and 

1512(c)(1) on the other hand, which has the 

phrase "record, document, or other object," and 

said, well, that's the broad obstruction 

provision.  That's the one that's intended to be 

codified in this broader prohibition that's

aimed at official proceedings, and that (c)(1) 

language is actually quite broader and would

 scoop up the entire world of physical objects, 

in contrast to the narrowing interpretation the

 Court accepted in Yates.

 So I don't think the idea that 1519 

was the broad catchall can in any way be squared 

with what that statute says or how this Court 

interpreted it in Yates. And, instead, I think 

that the -- the example to draw from Yates or 

the lesson to learn from it is that this Court 

recognized that Congress was plugging the 

specific hole in the Enron scandal and it did so 

with overlapping provisions, 1512(c)(1) and 

1519, but it was 1512 that the Court pointed to 

as the place where you would sensibly locate 

this broader provision that aims at the full 

range of obstructive acts to catch the known 

unknowns. 

With respect to the question -- I'm 

sorry. Now I'm forgetting the second question. 

Oh, about the other statutes and whether they 

would be endangered.  I would be concerned about 

that. I'm sure defendants would try to make 

arguments.  The language, the verb phrase is

exactly the same or in different order 

sometimes, but it's "obstructs, influences, or

 impedes," and so the relevant verbs in the actus

 reus would be similar.  There are different

 direct objects there.  For example, in 1503, 

it's the due administration of justice. In

 1505, it's the administration of the power of 

Congress's inquiry and investigation.

 But it's not clear to me whether --

whether defendants might seek to try to now 

artificially limit those -- those clauses beyond 

their plain terms, even though these kinds of 

provisions have been in the obstruction law, I 

think it traces all the way back to 1830, and 

they've never been understood to have that kind 

of narrow limitation to evidence impairment or 

anything else.

seem to trigger ejusdem generis under the Begay

 precedent.  And you've used the phrase a few 

times, "catchall provision," as does your brief.

 And the Scalia-Garner book describes ejusdem 

generis as how you interpret catchall

 provisions.  So does ejusdem generis apply here

 or not?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  No, we don't think

 it can sensibly apply here.  So the Court has 

said many times that "otherwise" is a natural 

way for Congress to create a broad catchall 

category.  And I certainly don't dispute that 

there can be situations where you have a 

parallel list of nouns or a parallel list of 

verbs where the Court might further think that 

ejusdem generis principles apply. 

But that's just not how 1512(c) is 

structured.  It has, as I've mentioned, its own 

complex internal structure.  You know, you've 

got the mens rea requirement that's unique to 

(c)(1), and Congress did not transplant that 

into (c)(2).  That triggers the other canon that 

when Congress uses disparate language in two 

adjacent provisions, usually it means something 

by that.

So I think that this just isn't the 

kind of situation where the Court could sensibly

 apply ejusdem generis.

 And the other thing I would say is

 that, you know, if the Court goes down the road 

of trying to glean some kind of requirement from 

(c)(1), the other reason the canon is 

inapplicable here is that it's not evident on 

its face what the common attribute would be, and 

-- and that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, that -- that

out what the common link among the words in the

that distinguish -- that point I don't think 

distinguishes this case from other ejusdem 

generis cases.  But you can respond to that.

usually the common link or the connective tissue

 is the language that follows the word

 "otherwise."  That's the congressionally

 approved similarity.  That's what (c)(1) and

 (c)(2) have in common.  They both relate to 

obstructing an official proceeding.

 And, you know, I -- I recognize that

 Petitioner has invoked Begay.  Your question 

touched on it. But the statute in Begay, which 

we think is not the model of -- of statutory 

interpretation to follow here, the statute 

itself was -- was relevantly different. It had 

a list of nouns, and so it was the kind of 

statute where potentially ejusdem generis could 

apply. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What about the 

contextual points, a couple of them that I think 

have come up, but I just want to make sure you 

have a chance to respond, that it would be odd 

to have such a broad provision tucked in and 

connected by the word "otherwise." 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  I don't think that 

the placement in the statute is odd at all for a 

couple of different reasons.  One is the point I

Court's own recognition that 1512 is one of the

 big obstruction statutes.  This is the statute 

that is aimed generally at official proceedings.

 It's not more discrete.  And there are other

 provisions like 1519 and some of the ones that 

come right before it that are more narrowly 

confined and are in -- intended to reflect

 discrete circumstances.  That doesn't describe 

1512 at all. So, when Congress was trying to 

broadly prohibit obstruction of official 

proceedings, 1512 was exactly the right place to 

go. 

Then Petitioner says, well, Congress 

buried it in the middle of the -- of the 

statute.  But I -- I think it's actually quite 

explicable when you look at how the other 

provisions are structured.  1512(d), which I was 

discussing with Justice Alito, has a much more 

minimal penalty and doesn't require the intent 

to obstruct.  So it made sense to put 1512(c) 

before it but also after 1512(a), which is the 

most serious obstruction, like killing a 

witness, punishable by 30 years or up to life. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Last question. 

There are six other counts in the indictment

 contact with the -- the victim, assault,

 entering and remaining in a restricted building,

 disorderly and disruptive conduct, disorderly 

conduct in the Capitol building. And why aren't

 those six counts good enough just from the

 Justice Department's perspective given that they

 don't have any of the hurdles?

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Because those 

counts don't fully reflect the culpability of 

Petitioner's conduct on January 6th.  Those 

counts do not require that Petitioner have acted 

corruptly to obstruct an official proceeding. 

And, obviously, Petitioner committed other 

crimes that we've charged and that we're seeking 

to hold him accountable for. 

But one of the distinct strands of 

harm, one of the -- the -- the root problems 

with Petitioner's conduct is that he knew about 

that proceeding, he had said in advance of 

January 6th that he was prepared to storm the 

Capitol, prepared to use violence, he wanted to 

intimidate Congress.  He said they can't vote if 

they can't breathe.  And then he went to the 

Capitol on January 6th with that intent in mind

 enforcement officer. 

That did impede the ability of the 

officers to regain control of the Capitol and 

let Congress finish its work in that session.

 And I think it is entirely appropriate for the

 government to seek to hold Petitioner

 accountable for that conduct with that intent.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And are the 

sentences -- the sentence available is longer 

for this count than for any of the other counts 

or all of them together? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  The statutory 

maximum is higher, but, after a recent decision 

in the D.C. Circuit which held that a particular 

sentencing enhancement doesn't apply, that was 

the Brock case, I believe the sentencing range, 

the guidelines range, for the assault count 

would actually be a higher guidelines range. 

And just to give you a sense for a 

typical January 6th defendant, someone who 

doesn't have a prior criminal history and who 

committed violent conduct at the Capitol, 

accepting responsibility, I think the average

yield is 10 to 16 months of imprisonment. For 

someone who didn't commit violence, it would be 

six to 12 months of imprisonment.

 We've looked at the average sentences

 here. There are about 50 that have gone to

 sentencing -- conviction and sentencing on just 

a 1512(c)(2) as the only felony. So I think 

that's the best way to gauge it. This was when 

the sentencing enhancement did apply, so the 

ranges were higher.  The average sentence among 

the approximately 50 people is 26 months of 

imprisonment, and the median has been 24 months. 

So there's -- there's no reasonable 

argument to be made that the statutory maximum 

here is driving anything with respect to 

sentencing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  General, I want to 

ask a clarifying question about the distinction 

in the government's charging decisions between 

(c)(1) and (c)(2).  Actually, let me make that 

stronger.  Not charging decisions; like what you 

could charge under the statute.

So, as you pointed out to Justice 

Kavanaugh just now, you know, (c)(1) has this

 additional mens rea requirement. But, you know,

 there is overlap.  If you read "otherwise 

obstructs, influences," et cetera, broadly, it

 would encompass -- you know, frankly, even on

 the other reading, it would encompass things

 like "alters, destroys, mutilates," et cetera.

 But you wouldn't have to prove the 

extra mens rea.  I thought I heard you say, and 

I just want to clarify, to Justice Jackson 

earlier in the argument that the government 

could not charge an alteration, mutilation, 

concealing a document or physical object under 

(c)(2).  Am I --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  That's correct.  We 

usually charge the specific paragraph and so, if 

the conduct fits within (c)(1), we would charge 

it under (c)(1), and that would be the proper 

place to locate the charge. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And is that 

charging, is that prosecutorial discretion, or 

do you think the statute would permit you to 

charge it under (c)(2), thereby escaping the 

specific intent requirement?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Well, let me say

 that there is a specific intent requirement

 under (c)(2).  So there's no distinction between 

them in that regard.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it's

 different than the -- yeah.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  It's the intent to

 obstruct the official proceeding.  So you're 

right that we wouldn't have to prove intent to, 

you know, mutilate a document or something, but 

we -- we would still have to show the intent to 

obstruct the proceeding. 

You know, this is pressing on honestly 

what's a difficult question about means versus 

elements, and I think the best look at -- the 

best reading of the statute is that these are 

different elements because they have these 

different actus reus, they have the different 

mens rea require -- the mens rea requirement 

that's specific to (c)(1).  They each 

independently prohibit attempts. But it's a --

it's a hard question ultimately. 

And if we charged under the wrong 

paragraph accidentally, I think we could usually 

say that that was harmless error or else

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Let me ask 

you a question that kind of gets at some of the

 same points that Justice Alito's questions were

 getting at.

 So what if on January 6th the Capitol 

itself had not been breached, the protest is 

going on outside the Capitol, "Stop the Steal, 

Stop the Steal," police are, you know, in 

megaphones saying, "Disperse, disperse," they're 

too close to the Capitol, their goal is to 

impair, impede, stop the proceeding, stop the 

counting of votes. 

Does that violate the statute in your 

view under this "impede" language? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I think -- I 

think that one relevant question would be 

whether we could satisfy the nexus requirement 

and show that actually the natural and probable 

effect of that conduct would be to have some 

effect on what's going on in the Capitol, and in 

the mine run --

 Now, as I mentioned before, even with

much more serious breach, we don't have that 

evidence of intent for everyone. 

But, if we had, for example,

limiting construction of the verbs "obstruct,"

 "influence," or "impedes," to have this extra

 element.

 Tell me why I shouldn't be concerned

 about the breadth of the government's reading

 just relying on "corruptly" and the nexus

 requirement.  Should I be concerned or -- or

 could you just embrace it and say, yeah, there 

might be some as-applied First Amendment 

challenges or that sort of thing? 

I mean, can I -- can I be comfortable

You certainly don't have to agree with us that a

thought that this was unqualified and swept 

broadly to any kind of hindrance whatsoever, 

there would still be really important limits in 

the statute.  Obviously, you'd have to have the

 You'd have to show that the defendant

 knew that the natural and probable effect would

 do that.  You'd still have to show the corruptly

 mens rea.  And as you mentioned, even if you 

could show all of that, if it were a 

circumstance that really did infringe on First

 Amendment rights, there would always be the 

backstop of an as-applied constitutional 

challenge. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Do you think it's 

plausible that Congress would have written a 

statute that broadly?  I mean, let's say that I 

think that Justice Alito's example of the 

protestors in the courtroom, you know --

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yeah. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- it's -- it's --

let's say it's corrupt, and it -- and it impedes 

the proceeding because we have to go off the 

bench and things are stopped. 

Let's say I think that that's covered 

by the word "impedes" and let's -- there's the 

nexus, then it's corruptly.  Is it plausible to 

think Congress wrote a statute that would sweep 

that in?

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes.  I think that

 there are a lot of legitimate ways to -- to try

 to voice your dissent if you disagree with what 

the Court is doing, but one of the ways you

 cannot do it is come into this courtroom, halt 

the proceedings, force the Justices to leave the

 bench, and do it with the intent and the corrupt

 mens rea.  I think that Congress could think 

that is a severe intrusion on the functioning of 

our government and want to protect against that. 

And, again, the 20-year statutory max, 

of course, is just a max.  There's no mandatory 

minimum.  So Congress would have recognized that 

sentencing courts would use their discretion to 

tailor the actual sentence to the facts of the 

that specific offense. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice 

Jackson? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So you've emphasized 

several times that Congress wasn't writing on a 

blank slate in 1512(c).  But do you dispute that

real-world context?

 document destruction, and, you know, there was 

nothing as far as I can tell in the enactment 

history as it was recorded that suggests that 

Congress was thinking about obstruction more

 generally.  They had this particular problem and

 it was destruction of information that would

 have -- could have otherwise been used in an

 official proceeding. 

So can you just give us a little bit 

more as to why we shouldn't think of this as 

being a narrower set of circumstances to which 

this text relates? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Sure.  And, you 

know, I'd start by saying that we, of course, 

acknowledge that the immediate impetus for 

adding 1512 to the statute was to close the 

Enron loophole.  It was a -- a glaring loophole 

in the coverage of the obstruction laws that it 

wasn't a crime for you personally to destroy the 

document and the government had to charge people 

for instead persuading other people to destroy 

documents. 

So that was front of mind for 

Congress, and Congress wanted to address it.  It 

did address it with (c)(1) and with 1519

 separately.

 But I think the best way to look at 

what Congress was doing in light of that context 

is to consider the fact that Congress went

 further and enacted (c)(2).  The broader lesson

 Congress took away from Enron is that when you

 set out in advance to try to enumerate all the

 various ways that official proceedings can be 

obstructed, things will slip through the cracks. 

You can't always foresee it. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Let me just ask you 

this. Was (c)(2) enacted at the same time as 

(c)(1)? 

GENERAL PRELOGAR:  Yes, it was. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And so why couldn't 

the broadening relate to other ways in which one 

might prevent a proceeding from accessing 

information? 

So one is documents, records, and 

other objects.  But the known/unknown, we don't 

know, you know, could it be intangible, for 

example, that (c)(2) is sort of getting at when 

one gets at physical objects?

from what's happening in (1) in the context in

which it was actually enacted to all of 

obstruction in any form.

 GENERAL PRELOGAR:  So I -- I think the 

reason why we wouldn't suggest that the context

 could bear that narrower reading is because of 

the actual language that Congress used. If it 

was really just worried about other kinds of

 record-based, proceeding-based, evidence-based 

ways of obstructing, then there were easy 

templates to add that in as a residual clause to 

(c)(1).  There was no need to have this entirely 

separately numbered prohibition. And especially 

there was no need to use the well-recognized 

verb phrase "obstructs, influences, or impedes," 

which was clearly drawn from these other --

omnibus clauses that sweep more broadly. 

So I think -- it -- it -- you know, we 

think that it's perfectly consistent with the 

statutory history here to recognize that after 

Enron, what Congress thought is we don't want 

novel ways that we aren't thinking about of 

obstructing a proceeding to not be a crime.  We 

do want to cover the waterfront of obstructive 

conduct with the backstop of a corruptly mens 

rea, the limitation to an official proceeding,

tips off the targets of a search warrant is 

someone who is certainly attempting to impair 

the integrity or the availability of evidence

shown to counsel and counsel withdraws a

something that has caused an interference with 

an official proceeding. 

I heard my friend say twice in

peaceful protests as long as she could 

demonstrate or the government could demonstrate

 As the nexus, let's look at what

 1512(f) says.  "For the purposes of this 

section, an official proceeding need not be 

pending or about to be instituted at the time of

 the offense."  There is no nexus.  Congress has 

written it out of the statute right there.

 If the J6 defendants came on January 

5th and did all the kinds of things that they 

did, maybe one would hope, but if it had 

happened that way, it would still be a (c)(2) 

violation. 

With respect to the corruptly mens 

rea, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked a question 

yesterday about -- about the fact that mens rea 

as a break only works at trial because the 

government's allegations are taken as true at 

the motion to dismiss stage.  And I -- I think 

that's exactly right. 

And that's why it's not a break at all 

or, if it's any kind of break, it's a break on a 

-- on -- on a go-kart.  It's a wooden stick. 

What it means is that people like Mr. Fischer 

have to sit and go to trial and seek to -- to --

to win on a Rule 29 motion because the

government hasn't proved their mens rea.

 The same is true of First -- First

 Amendment defenses if peace -- peaceful 

protestors are charged with (c)(2). My friend 

referred to 1503 and 1505, other statutes 

within, and a number of the Justices have 

pointed out that there are much lower penalties

 for significant crimes.

 I would point the Court to 1752, which 

is civil disobedience in a restricted space, 

which is what Mr. Fischer is charged with. 

That's a misdemeanor.  If you cause substantial 

bodily injury, that is a 10-year -- a 10-year 

maximum penalty.  The government wants to 

unleash a 20-year maximum penalty on potential 

peaceful protests. 

That in and of itself is a bad idea 

because it's going to chill protected 

activities.  People are going to worry about the 

kinds of protests they engage in, even if 

they're peaceful, because the government has 

this weapon. 

Finally, I think we haven't touched

too, and that would all -- not only would it be

 peaceful protests, it could be advocacy.  It --

it could be all kinds of lobbying.  Those things

 would be covered as well, we've -- we've pointed 

out in our briefs.

 Then, finally, I would say to the

 Court let's not forget that civil proceedings

 are covered here -- we -- we would submit civil

 evidentiary proceedings -- but civil 

proceedings.  So the government is suggesting 

that the Court should unleash a 20-year 

obstruction -- maximum obstruction statute on 

civil litigation in federal courts. 

I submit that that is, and we would 

submit that that is, a very serious tool to put 

in the hands of prosecutors. 

We urge that the Court reverse the 

D.C. Circuit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:51 a.m., the case 

was submitted.)
