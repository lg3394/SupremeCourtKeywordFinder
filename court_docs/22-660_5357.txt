 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-660,

 Murray versus UBS Securities.

 Ms. Anand.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EASHA ANAND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. ANAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

in the wake of the Enron meltdown to encourage 

whistleblowers to report misconduct that could 

threaten the finances of millions.  The question 

in this case is how claims that an employer 

acted with retaliatory intent are to be proven. 

The plain text of the statute answers 

that question.  District court actions shall be 

governed by the burdens of proof in AIR21. 

AIR21, in turn, places exactly one burden of 

proof on plaintiff, to show that his protected 

conduct was a contributing factor in the 

unfavorable personnel action. 

The burden then shifts to the 

defendant to prove that it would have taken the

same unfavorable personnel action in the absence 

of the protected conduct, in essence, that it 

did not act with retaliatory intent.

 The Second Circuit held that the 

contributing factor element required a showing

 of retaliatory intent.  UBS does not defend that 

holding, nor could it. UBS instead contends 

that in addition to showing the contributing

 factor element, a plaintiff must separately show 

retaliatory intent. 

But UBS never grappled with the plain 

text of the statute, which says that an action 

shall be governed by the burdens in AIR21.  And 

having now disclaimed any requirement that a 

plaintiff show animus, UBS never explains what 

its proposed retaliatory intent element would 

amount to, other than the second step of the 

burden-shifting framework, a showing that the 

employer would not have taken the adverse action 

in the absence of the protected conduct. 

I welcome this Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  If you did not have 

the burden-shifting framework, would there be an 

intent requirement? 

MS. ANAND: So, yes, Your Honor.  That

is, the burden-shifting framework is designed to

 prove the intent element.  Absent the

 burden-shifting framework, the default rule

 would apply and plaintiff would just have to

 show intent.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, it just seems 

that the substantive statute provides for

 but-for -- but-for causation and has an intent

 requirement.  But you're saying the burden-of-

proof requirement seems to -- framework seems to 

eviscerate that substantive requirement. 

MS. ANAND: I wouldn't say 

"eviscerate."  I would say it's how you prove 

that substantive requirement.  So, for instance, 

in Title VII, the same language, "discriminate 

because of," can either be proven entirely by 

the plaintiff or, depending on the type of case, 

Congress has sometimes said there's a 

burden-shifting framework that comes in.  You 

just have to show a motivating factor, and then 

the burden shifts. 

In other words, this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm a bit 

confused by that answer.  I understand the 

meaning of "discriminate" means to treat someone

 differently.  And I don't know how you can prove 

intent other than to show by action that

 something has -- someone has discriminated: 

they fired someone, they demoted someone, they

 treated them differently in some way.  They

 discriminated against them.

 So I don't think there's any question 

that there was an intent to fire this person,

 correct? 

MS. ANAND: That's correct, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so the 

causation issue is not about intent -- or the 

issue is not about the intent to fire someone. 

The issue is what relationship does it have to 

the act? 

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I don't know 

where your answer to Justice Thomas comes that 

if there wasn't this burden-shifting, that we 

would have a different kind of intent.  We would 

still be charging people with did they fire them 

because of this, correct?

Honor. The question would just be who has to 

prove that, that the firing was because of the

 protected conduct or trait.  The default rule is

 plaintiff.  In this case, Congress has chosen to

 put a burden-shifting framework in the statute 

that gives the plaintiff an initial burden 

before the burden shifts to the defendant.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the question --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What did the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- of intent, as 

you said, might arise in motivating factor cases 

because then the jury has to find out whether 

this was more important or not than other 

reasons, correct --

MS. ANAND: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- basically? 

MS. ANAND: -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. The analogy to Title VII is just to say 

that Congress is entitled to come up with 

different schemes to prove this same thing, 

namely, that the employer took the adverse 

employment action because of the protected trait 

or conduct. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What -- what do 

you think "contributing factor" means?  Because

I think both sides' positions have difficulty 

hanging together completely because of the 

interaction of "contributing factor" and, as you 

call it, step 2. At least for me, that's the --

I'm trying to figure out how those fit together.

 So what do you think "contributing

 factor" means?

 MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, I think

 the -- the simplest answer is that it's a term 

of art drawn from the Whistleblower Protection 

Act. And for a generation, the definition 

adopted by the Federal Circuit has been, alone 

or in combination with other factors, affects 

the -- the adverse employment action. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And, in -- in your 

brief, I think on 29, you said that knowledge by 

the employer of the protected activity plus 

temporal proximity would be good enough in this 

particular statute to show contributing factor. 

Is that correct? 

MS. ANAND: Yes, Your Honor.  So 

that's actually in the text of the Whistleblower 

Protection Act.  Right. It's the first time 

Congress uses this "contributing factor" 

language.  So they give an example of what would

suffice, and they say knowledge plus temporal

 proximity.

 So, again, what you've got at that

 point is protected conduct, so someone had

 objectively reasonable evidence of securities

 fraud and recorded -- and reported it; you've 

got the fact that they were fired; you've got

 the employer's knowledge; and they were fired

 shortly after reporting objectively reasonable 

evidence of securities fraud. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah, that's a 

sensible scheme, I think.  I'm not sure it maps 

completely onto the term "contributing factor," 

but I -- I understand where you're getting that 

as a term of art. 

MS. ANAND: That's right, Your Honor. 

And, again, in the Whistleblower Protection Act, 

Congress explained what "contributing factor" 

meant. Subsequently, it didn't put that 

explanation in the statute, presumably because, 

in future statutes, it thought that term was 

adequately defined. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But it's tricky, 

though, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  As I understand your

 argument, intent plays no role whatsoever in --

discriminatory intent plays no role whatsoever 

in what the plaintiff must prove.

 MS. ANAND: So that's right, Your

 Honor, that the plaintiff can get the burden to

 shift without showing discriminatory intent, 

although I think what Congress believed is that 

at the point where you've shown this protected 

conduct, temporal proximity, and adverse action, 

there's something like a presumption, as the SG 

put it, of intent, and that's why we shift the 

burden. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So in -- let's say 

that an individual engages in protected 

activity, an employee engages in protected 

activity, and, as a result of that, the employer 

investigates the employee's performance and 

finds that the employee actually has embezzled a 

hundred thousand dollars. 

The -- the plaintiff would not have to 

show that the decision to discharge was based in 

any way on the -- that the -- the motivation,

the thinking of the decisionmaker was based in 

any way on the protected activity? That would 

be up to the employer then to show by clear and 

convincing evidence that person would have been

 discharged upon the discovery of this even if

 there had never been protected activity?  That's

 your argument?

 MS. ANAND: So, yes, Your Honor.  That

 is, obviously, at step 2, the employer wins 

because they can show anyone who embezzled a 

hundred thousand dollars would have gotten fired 

whether or not they'd engaged in protected 

activity.  But that's right.  Congress believed 

that employees shouldn't have to have evidence 

of what was in the head of the decisionmaker at 

the moment of the decision before the burden 

shifted. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  The key language in 

that part of the statute is that the protected 

activity was a contributing factor in the 

unfavorable personnel action alleged in the 

complaint. 

So you read "unfavorable personnel 

action" to mean simply discharge.  But can it 

not also be read to mean discriminatory

alleged in the complaint is the discriminatory

 discharge?

 MS. ANAND: So I -- I don't think so, 

Your Honor, and that's because that would render

 the contributing factor language superfluous; 

that is, if you had to say -- if you had to 

prove as part of it that there was a

 discriminatory discharge, what would it -- once 

you've shown there's a discriminatory discharge, 

by definition, the protected conduct was a 

contributing factor.  In fact, you've shown a 

much higher standard. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I don't quite

answer.  Could you explain it to me again? 

MS. ANAND: Sure.  So, if an employee 

has to show discriminatory discharge --

contributing factor to the discharge decision.

 MS. ANAND: So, if Your Honor's 

question is whether the -- the contributing 

factor has to be to the decision rather than 

just some part of the causal chain, I'll just 

say that I don't know that this case is exactly 

the right case to draw that distinction if 

there's something below retaliatory intent.

 Remember, in this case, during the 

jury deliberations, there's a second instruction 

given that uses "affects the decision."  That's 

the language.  It's at JA 180. 

And so, if this Court thinks there's 

some lesser showing than retaliatory intent that 

has to do with affecting the decision versus 

just being part of the causal chain, this case 

wouldn't be the right case to make that 

determination. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But doesn't it --

don't you have to do that if you're going to 

show -- if you're going to rule out the 

hypotheticals that UBS raises and the ones that

customer takes her business elsewhere, and then 

the department is eliminated, and so, even 

though the employer was very supportive of the

 whistleblowing, she loses her job because

 there's no work left.

 I took your brief, your reply brief, 

to say no, no, no, no, no, that wouldn't happen. 

Is it your position that those kinds of

 hypotheticals only get ruled out at step 2 by 

the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard or, 

as Justice Alito's saying, if you have to show 

some sort of link between the discharge and the 

decision, it seems like some of them might get 

ruled out at the first step? 

MS. ANAND: So I think that's right, 

Your Honor.  So two responses.  The first is 

Marano in the Federal Circuit, right, the case 

that interprets "contributing factor," seems to 

say those cases get to the second step, right? 

So, in that case, the fact pattern is 

a whistleblower reports.  As a result, the 

employer cleans house, fires everyone related to 

this unit, and the plaintiff is discharged as 

part of that.

 just cleaning house, that --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But that's not the

 hypothetical.  Could you address in the 

hypothetical where the employer is grateful for 

the information, cleans house, and the customer

resolved at the second step because the employer 

at that point can show that they would have 

fired the plaintiff even if the customer had 

left for a different reason.

motive -- show motivating, but it played a role

 in the decision --

MS. ANAND: Right.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- even if not a

 determinative one, some role.

 MS. ANAND: So -- and I don't want to

 fight you too hard on this because, again, in

 our case, there's an instruction that says

 "affected the decision." 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But the way we write 

the opinion affects other cases too obviously. 

MS. ANAND: Sure.  So I take it that 

is not what the Second Circuit meant by 

"retaliatory intent."  So you at least have to 

reverse the Second Circuit, right, because the 

Second Circuit required some sort of animus 

showing.  It did not believe that the 

instruction at JA 180, which says "affected the 

decision," was sufficient. 

But, if Your Honors decide to write an 

opinion that says "affected the decision," I 

think that's not quite consistent with Marano 

and the definition there, but it's certainly an 

interpretation of the statute we'd be 

comfortable with so long as you don't say

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you mean --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- by -- what do you

 mean by "animus"?  I mean, we -- we use that

 term a lot.  We toss it around.  What do you --

what does it mean here?  Does it mean something 

different than some sort of discriminatory

 intent? 

MS. ANAND: So yes, Your Honor.  This 

Court has distinguished between discriminatory 

intent, which simply means you want to treat 

someone differently on account of or because of 

the protected trait or conduct --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right, right. 

MS. ANAND: -- and animus, which is 

sort of like you have a bad motive in your 

heart. And so this Court has routinely said 

that in discrimination statutes, there's no 

requirement to show animus. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And -- and --

MS. ANAND: And, indeed, I think UBS 

disclaims any animus requirement at Footnote 3.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and -- and so I'm

 sorry for interrupting, but --

MS. ANAND: Please.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I -- I wonder, is

 that enough for the day?

 The Second Circuit opinion can be read 

in various ways, but one of which possible 

reading is, in addition to an intent to 

discriminate, you have to prove a further intent 

or a motive to retaliate. 

And we've rejected that in the Title 

VII context many times, saying you may have the 

further intent of trying to equalize men and 

women as groups, you may have a further intent 

of wishing to discriminate on the basis of 

motherhood.  Irrelevant.  Intent to discriminate 

is enough for the day. 

Could we simply say that and not get 

into how this statute overall works, which seems 

to me to raise a bunch of other questions that 

may be more than we need to do for today? 

React to that. 

MS. ANAND: So I think that's correct, 

Your Honor.  I think that that would be enough

not the definition of "contributing factors." 

You say -- you say it's something that

let the Second Circuit think about what the 

proper charge should be?

this to be a term of art, this Court doesn't

 Federal Circuit case to conclude that something

 was a term of art.  So I just want to make that 

clear, that you can conclude "contributing 

factor" is a term of art without having a

 Supreme Court decision on point. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that --

that's -- there's -- there were a lot of reasons

 for that, not the least of which is that 

Congress did tend to adopt it as a term of art, 

but not in this case.  They created this term of 

art. 

MS. ANAND: That's -- that's right,

So I -- well, putting that aside --

MS. ANAND: So -- so -- okay. So --

so that's my first-line answer. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. 

MS. ANAND: The second-line answer is, 

even if you conclude that you're not sure about 

the "tends to affect in any way" jury 

instruction, remember, there's a second jury 

instruction in this case that is "affects the 

decision."  Someone with knowledge because of 

that knowledge affected the decision.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.

 still --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 Thank you, counsel.

 Normally, in the law in these types of

 cases, there is a distinction between liability 

and causation. In a car accident, you're 

speeding and you hit a car and injure the person 

or allegedly injure the person, the speeding is 

liability, right?  Whether that has resulted in 

an injury, whether it's caused it is -- is a 

different question. 

Now your position merges those two, 

right? You don't separately look for liability 

and causation? 

MS. ANAND: So I think there are two 

different types of causation we're talking about 

here. So, for liability, yes, you have to show 

you acted because of the protected activity. 

There's still the causal connection between what 

the employer did and your damages, right? 

There -- that -- there's a separate

 causation inquiry that looks more like the 

speeding example you gave, which is, given that 

the employer suspended or demoted or discharged,

 what damages is the employer liable for?  So

 causation comes in again at that step.

 But I think, in every discrimination

 case, right -- this is EEOC versus 

Abercrombie -- the core question is did the

 employer take the action because of the 

protected trait or conduct.

causation.  And I think your friend on the other 

side draws the sharp distinction between 

liability and causation.  And your position is 

that there is no distinction of that sort? 

MS. ANAND: So I'm -- I'm not sure my 

friend on the other side has an example --

having disclaimed animus, it's not clear what 

"discriminate" would mean, other than acting on 

account of or because of. 

And this is -- again, in EEOC versus 

Abercrombie, this Court interprets the term 

"discriminate" and says it's got three parts. 

You've got to show adverse action, because of, 

protected trait.

you describe the United States' position. 

Two additional persuasive

United States' position is either in conflict or 

at least in tension with yours, so I was 

wondering if you could explain to me why you 

think that's not so or whether you really think 

it is so. 

MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, I think 

the differences are semantic; that is, both we

step 1; contributing factor, step 2; and then 

you end up with isolating those employers who

 engaged in discrimination.  Whether it is, as 

the United States says, because, after step 1,

 there's a presumption that can be rebutted by

 the employer or whether it's, as we say, 

because, after step 2, the employer has not been 

able to show a lack of retaliatory intent, I'm 

not sure it matters, right? That's a semantic 

distinction.  The point is you get through both 

steps and then --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're -- you're 

saying there's no practical difference, but the 

sort of analytic way that the argument spools 

out is different? 

MS. ANAND: I think that's right, Your

instructed on both steps and the plaintiff has 

to win on both steps, I'm not sure it matters.

I have your answer. Your answer is that we

 don't need to address that because the follow-up 

jury instruction after the question was raised 

by the jury didn't use "tends to affect," is

 that --

MS. ANAND: That's correct, Your

 Honor.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.

 MS. ANAND: And, again, the Second 

Circuit's holding was based on this requirement 

that there be some retaliatory intent component. 

So, as long as you don't agree with that, as 

between the two jury instructions, I'm not sure 

this Court has to make a -- a -- a decision. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then going 

back to my original questions about knowledge of 

the protected activity and temporal proximity, 

and you said that's basically what it means --

that's what you said in your brief -- do jury 

instructions, however, usually define 

"contributing factor" in that way? 

MS. ANAND: So, no, Your Honor, and 

that's because, in the Whistleblower Protection 

Act, it's -- it's -- it's illustrative, right? 

So the "such as," this shall be sufficient.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Mm-hmm.

 MS. ANAND: And so the jury doesn't 

necessarily need to find those two elements. In

 virtually every case, that's how it's proven, 

right? That's the sort of standard way that

 plaintiffs prove their case.  But it's

 illustrative, not exhaustive.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But I think, as 

the jury here had confusion, lots of juries 

probably have confusion trying to figure out 

what "contributing factor" means before they do 

step 2.  Is that not your understanding from 

reviewing cases of this sort? 

MS. ANAND: I don't think so, Your 

Honor. That is, remember, again, you've got to 

show protected activity, someone reported fraud. 

You've got to show a retaliatory discharge.  In 

almost every case I've seen, the plaintiff's 

also showing knowledge by the employer. 

And so the best way to establish a 

causal connection between the protected activity 

and the discharge is to show that it happened 

pretty close in time; that is, most juries don't 

believe there's a causal connection if you -- if 

someone's fired a year or two after they report

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just clarify? 

Way back at the beginning, perhaps in your

 introduction, you talked about discriminatory

 intent.  And so I'm just trying to understand, 

do you believe that there is an element of 

intent at work here and it's being taken care of 

by the burden-shifting test, or intent is not an 

element at all in this framework or in this 

area? 

MS. ANAND: So we believe that 

Congress designed the burden-shifting framework 

to address discriminatory intent.  Does that --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And so -- but you 

have to have it in order to be liable for this, 

but you -- but what -- you've defined it as the 

employer taking the action because of protected 

conduct, not some sort of animus or something 

like that? 

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right.  So, 

properly understood, discriminatory intent is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The Second Circuit held that SOX 

requires retaliatory intent, which the court 

determined to mean prejudice and conscious 

disfavor of the employee because of 

whistleblowing.  The court also stated that that 

interpretation was identical to its 

interpretation requiring proof of discriminatory 

animus in the railroad safety whistleblowing 

context.  That holding, which exactly tracked 

Respondents' arguments, is incorrect. 

First, the term "discriminate against" 

means differential treatment that injures a 

protected individual.  That is the same meaning 

as in Title VII, and this Court's Title VII

cases make clear that discrimination does not 

turn on such motive or animus. All that's 

required is the decision to treat differently be

 made because of the protected activity.

 Second, Congress directed that SOX

 claims be adjudicated using AIR21's burdens of

 proof, which requires proof that the protected

 activity, not retaliatory intent, was a 

contributing factor in the employer's decision. 

That simply requires that the protected activity 

played a part in producing the decision. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Yang, is there 

any difference or daylight between your position 

and Petitioner's position? 

MR. YANG: I -- I -- I believe there 

is, and maybe I can help illustrate this with 

looking at three different options to look at. 

One is a pure chain-of-causation type 

of an approach, that if you set a domino in 

effect and it ends up in a retaliatory decision, 

even if the decision didn't consider the first 

domino, that is, the retaliatory intent -- or 

the -- the -- the whistleblowing, that chain of 

causation is enough. 

And I think that goes to the

 hypothetical, Justice Barrett, that you were

 asking about.

 That's not our position.  In fact, the 

-- that was a prior problem, chain of causation, 

that the ARB reversed course in 2019 in the 

Thorstenson and Yowell cases that we cite late

 in our brief.  What -- now the approach is is

 the -- which we think is our -- is our position, 

which we think is right, is that "contributing 

factor" requires proof that the protected 

behavior itself was a factor that played a role, 

not necessarily determinative, but just a role 

in producing the decision. 

That can be proven inferentially

 based only, for instance, on the employee's 

misconduct, even if the misconduct was revealed 

by a chain of dominos that started with the

 whistleblowing.

kind into the final factor that the employee 

plaintiff must prove.

 intent.

 MR. YANG: Their position goes

 further.  They call it retaliatory intent.  And

 retaliatory intent, they mean animus.  And

 animus is some kind of desire to harm because

 of. That is not required.

 Secondly, I think their position just

 doesn't work on the text. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, if you 

discriminate against somebody because that 

person engaged in protected activity, are you 

not retaliating against that person because the 

person engaged in protected activity? 

MR. YANG: I -- I don't think you 

would say that you're retaliating all the time. 

For instance, in the employers, there are 

instances where the employer goes:  We've got a 

whistleblower, I want to protect the 

whistleblower, I'm going to move the 

whistleblower to a different shift, different 

responsibilities because I'm concerned that 

other people might take action.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.

 MR. YANG: In this context, intent and

 causation, although they often are different

 concepts, they merge.

 The intent underlying the decision, 

that is, the reasons for the decision and what 

caused the decision to be made, is effectively 

the same because the decisionmaker's reasons are 

the cause for the decision. 

That's why, when you look at the 

burden-shifting scheme, it asks did the 

protected behavior play a role in and produce, 

which is contributing factor, the decision. 

It's a real low bar and you can prove it 

circumstantially. 

If so, even if it wasn't the but-for 

cause of the decision, it is enough intent to be 

shown here that you're treating them differently 

that you go to the affirmative offense --

MR. YANG: -- which makes sense 

because they have -- the employer has more 

information about the decision.

another run at the distinction between intent

 and causation because I --

 though --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  Have at

MR. YANG: But I -- I think, though, 

that Respondents' position just doesn't work on 

the text.  Retaliatory intent has to be a 

response to the whistleblowing behavior just by 

nature of the -- concept of retaliation. 

So, if the adverse action is taken 

with retaliatory intent, which they say has to 

be shown, then the whistleblowing will always be 

a contributing factor.  And if that's true, 

you've -- you've made the -- made the 

contributing factor inquiry superfluous, and 

that's just not right.

Congress sought in the contributing 

factor standard -- and this goes all the way 

back to the WPA and Mt. Healthy. If you look at 

the way that the Court has analyzed the -- these

 employment decisions, there's been a

 burden-shifting scheme.  Congress tweaked it to

 lower the standard to a contributing factor, and 

it did so because intent and causation here are

 really --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel --

proximity to the adverse employment decision?

There's a distinction between the proof --

liability.  I just mean, would that be 

sufficient to carry the employee's burden?  That

difference between the evidence that you use to

 prove the fact that you have to prove, and I

 think your question goes to the evidence. You

 could -- you could infer --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure, because

 knowledge is a separate element. I'm only

 talking -- knowledge and the fact that he 

engaged in public protected activity, all of 

that is separate. 

MR. YANG: And --

that shifting --

MR. YANG: Mm-hmm.  What the -- what 

the government's position is is what you have to

protected activity played a part in producing 

the decision, right? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right. 

MR. YANG: That's what the fact finder 

has to find.

 temporal proximity.  And, frankly, that's no

 different than in -- when, like, true intent is

 involved because, if someone's factual theory in 

a Title VII case is this person hates me because 

I'm of this protected trait, and you show that 

you have that protected trait, and you show

 that, you know, that decision and the adverse --

the adverse action, like, are in close temporal

 proximity, knowledge, and -- that's a way of 

proving intent.  It's not unique to this 

contributing factor context.  It's just true 

generally. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  So, when you say not 

necessarily, maybe it could be the difference 

of, you know, how long the temporal -- or how 

great the temporal proximity is? Like, hey, 

listen, if it was within two weeks of 

discovering about the protected activity versus 

six months? 

MR. YANG: And other things.  The --

the fact finder has to look at all the evidence 

when making this determination of circumstantial

goes to the question of discriminatory 

treatment, right? This is the discussion that

 we've had now about intent and causation.

 I -- I will say that the "as alleged 

in the complaint" does, if -- this is on page, I

 believe, 13A of our brief -- but, if you look at 

what has to be alleged in the complaint, it is 

"discharge or other discrimination by the person 

in violation of the provision." 

That -- so you'd also have to show 

that that person is, for instance, a securities 

-- a company with securities that are publicly 

traded.  That's part of the -- the retaliatory 

-- or the adverse action inquiry.  So --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I -- I -- I don't 

really understand the answer, but --

MR. YANG: Ultimately, it is the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  The employee plaintiff 

under this scheme has to show that the protected 

behavior, any behavior described in paragraphs 1 

through 4, was a contributing factor in the 

"unfavorable personnel action alleged in the 

complaint."

JUSTICE ALITO:  So "unfavorable

 personnel action alleged in the complaint" could 

be read to mean "the discharge," with no intent 

requirement, or it could be read to mean

 "discriminatory discharge" because that's what

 is prohibited by the statute.

 Doesn't it have to be one or the

 other? And what is your position on which of --

treatment because of the protected activity, and 

that's what this sentence is getting to.

how you read it, then I don't understand your 

answer about how discriminatory intent figures 

in this at all. It seems to me then you are

-- when Justice Gorsuch gave his relatively 

bare-bones disposition and you said, well, that 

leaves a lot on the table, you know, I wouldn't 

say you couldn't do it. Of course, you can do 

it. Happy if you're overturning the Second 

Circuit, but it leaves a lot on the table. 

Could you tell me what it leaves on 

the table and why you think -- whether you think 

there are any reasons not to leave those things 

on the table? 

MR. YANG: Well, I think maybe my 

exchange with Justice Alito may reflect that.  I 

mean, it's one thing to say that retaliatory 

intent's not required because, you know, 

retaliation is not required, is not the same,

I guess I'm just not sure what exactly you think

 I have been asking about.  What -- what would be

approach?  I'd -- I'd like to understand it if 

there is one.

is simply that there's no -- you're not going to 

err in -- in going that route. The question is

 Like, let's ignore the burden-shifting and just 

look at what this prohibition means, right, and

 it doesn't mean retaliatory intent.

these cases are adjudicated.  So -- and, again,

intent, right, because it's a means of inferring 

intent, the protected behavior was a

 role in -- in -- in producing the decision, 

right, and that that's all that you need to

 show, and then it -- you -- the burden shifts to

 the -- the employer to -- to make out its

 affirmative defense.

 I think that would go a long way in 

solving some of the issues that come up. You 

could also, if you want to, say that's not a 

chain-of-causation type of -- of inquiry, but, 

you know, again, I don't want to step on the --

the Court's prerogatives about how it writes its

that. Thank you very much. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Kavanaugh? 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, a follow-up 

on that.  The reason you think retaliatory 

intent is not part of the employee's burden, as 

I understand it, is in part because, as Justice 

Gorsuch says, it's not there, but that's 

confirmed or underscored by the fact that it's 

step 2 of the burden-shifting framework that 

gets at retaliatory intent.  Is that not --

MR. YANG: I think that's true, that

 the step 2 --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Or is that not

 right?

 MR. YANG: No, no, no. Step 2 can --

can address two -- types of circumstances.  One,

 the employer can say: Look, taking our decision 

as a given, like, we would -- like, if you look 

at the decision, the contributing -- the 

protected activity was so remote, like, we would 

have reached the decision the same way. 

But it also allows employers to do 

something else, which is the employers can say: 

Yeah, we had a bad actor as supervisor.  The guy 

fired the employee because of the protected 

activity.  He hates whistleblowers.  But, by the 

way, we also had a RIF going on that was 

completely independent.  We would have gotten to 

the same way -- the same result. 

So there's two things -- and -- and 

the employer can prove that too. So there's two

 protected activity, and the employer says -- and 

the person gets fired, and the employer says: 

We fired them because they were a poor

 performer, because we're doing a reduction in 

force, because they were embezzling, and not 

because of the protected activity. And then the 

jury has to weigh is the employer telling the 

truth or not, which is exactly what the closing

 arguments in this case were?

think you actually have to say -- look also at 

the text and say, when -- when Congress talked 

about a contributing factor in the personnel

actually consider the protected behavior, not

 something that was caused by the protected

 behavior in a long chain that could be quite

 tenuous.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  And just one 

other question that goes to Justice Gorsuch's 

point about how much we need to decide.

 Do you think that there's a risk that 

if we only say, listen, there's no extra element 

of retaliatory intent required, and we say 

nothing more, that it would leave open the 

possibility that lower courts would say:  Oh, 

okay, I guess that just means, you know, chain 

of causation?  Is that part of the concern, 

like, that it would send the --

MR. YANG: I don't know that the 

courts are inclined to go that way at this point 

now that the ARB has -- has corrected its 

position since 2019.  You never know.  You know, 

I think, if you look at the excellent briefing 

in this case on both sides, including the amici, 

I think there are a lot of questions to be 

raised.  Some of them are more central than the 

others.

 leave the Court to decide what's -- what's best

 to do in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So isn't the real 

risk of not going farther that it leaves open

 the possibility that courts will think there is

 still something more to do than the 

burden-shifting test? 

And I think the reason why that's kind 

of happening is because, as I read the 

Respondents' brief, they have separated 

causation from intent, and they suggest that the 

burden-shifting goes to something called 

causation in this world and that that doesn't 

cover intent, which is why, whether you have --

whether the level of that intent is retaliatory 

animus or something else, I think, if we just 

eliminate retaliatory -- retaliatory animus, 

there's still the question of, is there this 

intent element outside of the burden-shifting? 

And my understanding is your argument 

and Petitioner's argument is no, that the 

burden-shifting takes care of whatever intent,

 discriminatory intent, exists in this world, and

 so it would be a real benefit to make that

 clear, I think. 

MR. YANG: I think the Court could

 definitely conclude that.  I think, if the Court 

doesn't address the role of the burden-shifting 

scheme, you likely will leave open for 

litigation a cogent argument made by the other

 side which ultimately doesn't work because I 

think --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Well, let me -- let 

me also give you the opportunity to answer that 

question directly --

MR. YANG: Yeah.  Yeah. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- because what I'm 

struggling with is trying to understand how 

causation and intent are different in this 

world. When you're talking about the reason, I 

guess, for the person's having been fired, 

whether you say it as, you know, employer, what 

caused you to fire this person, that's 

causation, or, employer, why did you follow --

 When the -- the WPA language was

 adopted, Attorney General -- Thornburgh said,

 look, this "contributing factor" language says

 you have to contribute to the decision.  And

 when the -- the MSPB's regulations were issued,

 they say it has to affect the decision.

 So this is an unusual context where 

intent and causation don't have a meaningful 

difference.  And I think, frankly, the Court's

MR. SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

In Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress employed a 

phrase, "discriminate because of," that has long 

been recognized to require a plaintiff to show 

discriminatory intent.  It is this transplanted

case.

 Congress also incorporated in

 Sarbanes-Oxley the contributing-factor standard 

of the AIR21 statute to address a distinct issue

 that this Court and Congress occasionally

 grapple with, and that is the causation standard 

in a discrimination case. 

But just as Congress did not eliminate 

an intent requirement in Title VII when it 

adopted the reduced motivating factor causation 

test in Title VII, so in Sarbanes-Oxley it did 

not eliminate an intent requirement by 

incorporating the reduced contributing-factor 

causation test of AIR21. 

Put differently, the Petitioner errs 

by overreading the burdens-of-proof provision of 

AIR21. That provision addresses a distinct 

element, causation.  It does not purport to 

address all the elements a plaintiff must 

establish, not that she's a covered employee, 

not that her employer is a covered employer, and 

not that she was separated with retaliatory 

intent. 

Finally, Petitioner and the government 

err in relying on the Whistleblower Protection

 "discriminate because of" language which frames

 this case, and, indeed, Congress removed the

 phrase that the action had to be taken as a 

reprisal for protected activity.

 For these reasons and others,

 Petition -- Petitioner cannot overcome the 

strong presumption that discriminatory intent is

 plaintiff's burden in a Sarbanes-Oxley 

retaliation case. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Scalia, the 

Petitioner indicated earlier that you could use 

a motivating factor to prove -- demonstrate 

an -- an unlawful employment practice under 

Title VII. 

And contributing, I think her analogy 

was that the contributing factor here -- the --

the contributing-factor test here is similar to 

the motivating factor under Title VII. 

How would you respond to that? 

MR. SCALIA: Justice Thomas, I agree 

that the Title VII framework is a framework very 

similar to the framework that we have with 

Sarbanes-Oxley in AIR21, a much closer analogy,

Act, which we heard relatively about today.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mm-hmm.

 MR. SCALIA: But, as I said, there was

 a -- intent requirement to Title VII before

 motivating factor was added, and there remains 

one now, and it does not arise from motivating

 factor.

 What this Court said in Nassar is that 

the motivating factor test does not add a 

substantive bar.  Rather, it defines the 

causation standard for a violation defined 

elsewhere.  Same thing here. 

The violation is described in 

Sarbanes-Oxley.  Sarbanes-Oxley looks over to 

AIR21 solely for causation.  There's no way that 

that AIR21 provision could carry the weight 

Petitioner wants to give it.  As I mentioned in 

my opening, it leaves out elements of a 

Sarbanes-Oxley case. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Where -- where in 

the statute does it say causation?  I'm sorry, 

you say it looks over to pick up or reference 

causation, and I guess I'm trying to understand 

why you're saying that, because it doesn't seem

 MR. SCALIA: Justice Jackson, I think

 it's widely recognized by the practicing bar 

that this is a test of the causal role that's

 played.  I believe that is the -- Petitioner's 

position as well, but it's a reduced causal test 

just as this Court --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Understood.  But

 how -- how is that different than intent? Tell 

me -- tell me what is different about a 

determination that the adverse action was caused 

by the protected activity and that the employer 

-- you know, the -- the adverse action -- that 

the protected activity was a contributing factor 

or was intended because of the -- because of the 

protected activity? 

MR. SCALIA: Justice Jackson, this 

Court's cases recognize that the discriminatory 

intent required under Title VII and other 

similar laws and causation are actually 

importantly distinct. 

Now I would concede there are times 

when the evidence used to establish causation 

will also be evidence used to show intent as 

well, but take, for example, this Court's

decision in Babb v. Wilkie a few terms ago.

 This Court held that there could be

 discriminatory intent and liability for it under 

a special provision of the age discrimination

 law applicable to federal workers with no

 causation.

 The Court gave an example of a manager 

that has to make a promotion decision, rates one 

worker a 90, rates another worker an 85, and 

then, because he doesn't like older people, 

rates the younger worker down to an 80. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's animus. 

We're not -- I thought -- are you saying that 

animus has to be a part of this? Is that what 

you mean by discriminatory intent? 

MR. SCALIA: No, we are not saying 

that animus is necessary.  But we are saying 

that differential treatment for intentional 

reasons.  The way this Court defined it in Staub 

was to intend for discriminatory reasons that 

the adverse action occurred.  This Court called 

that the scienter that's required. 

So, in the Wilkie -- in the Babb v. 

Wilkie case, this Court said there was 

discriminatory intent, even though there wasn't

causation, because the older worker already had

 a lower score.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So is that what you

 would contemplate -- I'm just wondering what 

kind of proof you would use to show intent that 

would be different than the causation

 burden-shifting framework.

 You would say that the employee has to 

show that the employer harbored some sort of 

discriminatory intent with what evidence?  Like, 

how do you show it? 

MR. SCALIA: Sometimes it will be the 

same evidence that's used to show cause, but 

other times there's evidence such as I made a 

complaint and my boss had a very angry reaction, 

or I made a complaint and immediately afterward 

there was a lot of hustling about among the 

managers and I could tell that they were angry. 

Or my manager immediately began treating me 

differently. 

There often is additional evidence of 

intent.  And let me -- again, a question that's 

been presented here is, how much would we

 immensely.

 Take this Court's --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I -- I -- I

 don't understand that, Mr. Scalia, because 

everything that you just said, that seems to me

 exactly the question that the burden-shifting

 mechanism is all about.

 The employee comes in and says -- and 

says all of those things, I made a complaint and 

then terrible things started happening to me. 

And the employer says, no, not at all, 

I mean, that -- the -- these terrible things had 

nothing to do with the complaint.  It was 

because you were a terrible worker or because 

you embezzled money. 

So all of that is exactly what the 

burden-shifting -- mechanism is designed to suss 

out, and that's exactly the way you just 

explained what your intent requirement is.  So, 

at that point, I guess I just don't see what one 

is doing differently from the other. 

MR. SCALIA: And, again, there often 

can be overlap in the actual evidence required, 

but in terms of the impact for the case, it's 

very important.

Take, again, the Staub case.  This was

 the "cat's paw" case.  You -- you had 

retaliatory intent on the part of the immediate 

managers. It had some sort of remote causal

 role, but this Court very carefully looked both

 at intent and at causation as each -- as

 elements that had to be satisfied.  That is

 fundamental to discrimination law.

 And, by the way, I want to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's just 

saying that even with this intent to 

discriminate, you might fall below the threshold 

at which the intent matters, right?  And then 

the question is, you know, how much, what is a 

contributing factor, and how is that different 

from a motivating factor, and, you know, are you 

saying that you took the decision exclusively 

because of the -- the prohibited reason or 

partly because of the prohibited reason, and, if 

partly, how much because of the prohibited 

reason? 

So those questions would have to be 

answered, but -- but it's still the exact same 

question.  There's no here's where we have 

intent and here's where we have causation.

MR. SCALIA: Your Honor, where I begin 

is that the "discriminate because of" language

 is long -- language this Court has recognized

 from time immemorial requires discriminatory 

intent, an intent element, and then causation 

must be established too.

 The Petitioner has argued -- she

 began, Petitioner's counsel, by saying that this

 was -- how to handle claims that somebody acted 

with retaliatory intent.  Her argument is that 

gets determined at the second step.  But that's 

simply not true. 

She has admitted in her brief that 

retaliatory intent actually doesn't necessarily 

get discerned at the second step because an 

employer that did have retaliatory intent but 

nonetheless would have separated the person 

anyway wins.  That's the old Price Waterhouse 

case. 

On the other hand, an employer that 

lacked retaliatory intent can still lose at that 

second step.  So, Justice Kagan --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  How?

ways. First of all, the Halliburton case is a

 Fifth Circuit case, an old Fifth Circuit case, 

that Plaintiff cited as establishing the circuit

 split here.  The protected activity there was 

the employee complained within the company. He

 then complained to the SEC.  The SEC told the 

general counsel, we're going to be conducting an 

investigation, at which point the general

 counsel, as a general counsel does, sent out a

 notice to employees to retain documents. 

What he said was the SEC is 

investigating Mr. Menendez's allegations.  This 

is the employee.  Mr. Menendez said:  That hold 

notice was retaliatory action because it made my 

colleagues angry that I had said they were 

violating the law.  And so that was the 

protected activity. 

If that employer is forced to prove 

without any prior showing of intent that it 

would have let that employ -- that it would have 

sent out the hold notice anyway, that's 

impossible.  It sent out the hold notice for 

what were quite possibly very good-faith reasons 

because the complaint was made. 

Or another example, these things 

happen:  An employee, lawyer at a company,

 complains to the SEC, and woven throughout his

 complaint is privileged, confidential

 information.  The employer says: I do not want 

to be represented by a lawyer who discloses my

 privileged information to the SEC.  I'm going to

 have to let you go.

 Those things -- that employer is not 

going to be able to prove that he would have 

done the same thing absent the complaint to the 

SEC, because it was the complaint to the SEC 

that disclosed privileged information, which for 

innocent, good-faith, non-retaliatory reasons 

led to the separation. 

And then -- and then, finally, because 

this is important too, there's a long series of 

cases now under the FRSA, the Federal Railroad 

Safety Act, where plaintiff makes a complaint, 

there's an investigation, it's found that 

actually the plaintiff engaged in -- in 

misconduct at some point, and he's let go. 

And those cases were being forced to 

go to the -- the second step.  Employers 

sometimes weren't able to meet it.  And the 

courts eventually realized this doesn't work, 

this chain of causation, and they introduced an

 burden-shifting framework?  Is that right?

 MR. SCALIA: I'm saying that one thing 

that needs to be established in order for the

 burden to shift is that there was retaliatory

 intent.  The -- and in response to, Justice 

Alito, I believe, a question you were asking,

 AIR21 refers to whether the protected activity

 was a contributing factor to the unfavorable 

personnel action alleged in the complaint. 

If you go to Sarbanes-Oxley, the 

unfavored personal -- personnel action alleged 

in the complaint is, under Section 1, taken with 

discrimination. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is --

established through this burden-shifting

 mechanism only, and you read that because

 "discriminate because of" has traditionally had

 a mens rea requirement in it and Title VII and a

 whole bunch of other statutes.

 The other side says, in this

 particular new, novel regime, those two are

 collapsed into the causation requirement.

 So far so good? 

MR. SCALIA: I think that's 

accurate --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. 

MR. SCALIA: -- Justice Gorsuch. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The one thing we can 

maybe all agree on, though, is that whatever 

mens rea requirement does not -- is an intent to 

discriminate and not with a further motive or 

further intention of retaliation.  One could 

intend to discriminate for benign reasons, for 

example, and -- in the Title VII context, what 

some people think of as benign reasons.  I -- I 

want to equalize pay for men and women as a 

whole, one example the Court has used.

intent, that's required even in a disparate 

impact case, right?  Even in disparate impact, 

which we say doesn't require intent, requires 

intent not to hire the employee, not to promote 

the employee. 

What Staub said is there needs to be 

intent for discriminatory reasons that the 

adverse action occurred.  So there needs to be 

intent to take the action but to do it for a 

reason the law prohibits. 

And, Justice Gorsuch, I think to 

substitute the -- the plaintiff needs to show 

discriminatory intent for a requirement that the

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I agree with Justice 

Gorsuch in the sense that I don't see certain 

things in the statute, but I was curious in your 

briefing as to why you left out the other sort

 of actus reus parts of the statute.  You --

you've reduced it all down to "discriminate 

because of," which you say is the heart of the

 statute.

 But, before the word "discriminate," 

we have the company may not or no company may 

"discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, 

or in any other manner discriminate." 

And the reason why I think that might 

be important is that if you are right that there 

is some sort of mens rea that relates to 

retaliation, I guess I at least would have 

thought that Congress would write this 

differently, right?  That you would have a 

statute that would say one may not, comma, you 

know, purposefully or with retaliatory intent 

harass, demote, suspend, et cetera.  But that's 

not the way this is written. 

So it seems like "discriminate" is not 

necessarily doing the work that give -- in light 

of the entire sentence, doing the work that you

 "or in any other manner discriminate," which --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes.

 MR. SCALIA: -- has been read to mean

 that the others are forms of discrimination.

 But this Court, under Title VII, certainly has 

understood that "discharge" is modified by 

"discriminate"; "fail to promote," modified by 

"discriminate."  Our position, it modifies all. 

But, if you need more, Justice 

Jackson, I would point you to subsection (c), 

which refers to the relief that's available, and 

that refers specifically to the plaintiff 

receiving the seniority he would have had in the 

absence of the discrimination.  This statute 

plainly does contemplate that --

 other manner treat the person differently and is

 not necessarily carrying with it the kind of

 separate intent to discriminate, and to the 

extent it is there, it's in the burden-shifting 

test as to how you prove that intent?

 MR. SCALIA: We believe that

 "discriminate" as used in this context does 

again modify all the actions that would trigger 

liability, and that needs to be an intent to 

discriminate.  That is how the word 

"discriminate" in the statute has been 

understood. 

Again, I take you to Nassar.  This 

Court's decision regarding Title VII refers to 

the motivating -- factor test as a test of 

causation.  Intent resides elsewhere. 

Also, remember that the finding after 

the second step is actually of a violation.  The 

Petitioner's position is that a violation can be 

found under this statute without ever having 

established the improper intent.

discrimination is simply treating people

 differently.

 I gather it's the essence of your

 position that that's not true?

 MR. SCALIA: It's treating people 

differently in a way that is harmful to a

 protected individual and, additionally, under 

this Court's cases for decades, which, of 

course, were established law when this law was 

enacted, it -- it needs to be intentional 

discrimination. 

So that's our position, that we don't 

quarrel generally with their description of 

discriminate itself, but we add this Court has 

been crystal-clear that that discrimination 

needs to be intentional.  Otherwise, again, 

we're back at -- at disparate impact among other 

things. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, 

"intentional" -- there must be more to that term 

if you think that those sentences from your 

adversaries are -- are wrong because you can 

intentionally treat people differently, but you

them differently but for a reason the law 

prohibits. That, I believe, is just ingrained

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I -- I -- I --

 against because of" language.  Excuse me. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I think that 

basically is ingrained in all of our 

discrimination statutes.  They all have some 

requirement that a prohibited factor came into a 

decision and that it was there in your head when 

you made the decision. 

But what all of our decisions have 

recognized is the tent -- intent is a very 

difficult thing to prove, and, as a result of 

that, what Congress has done, and sometimes this 

Court has done it, has set up burden-shifting 

mechanisms.  You do this first.  Then we'll give 

you a chance to do that. 

They're all -- those burden-shifting 

mechanisms are geared to trying to figure out 

what was in his head when he made the decision.

Was the prohibited consideration in his head in

 the requisite way?  But, because that's hard to

 say directly, we'll shift burdens and tell

 different people to do different things.

 And that's exactly what this statute 

does and says that's the way you figure out 

whether the whistleblowing activity was in his 

head in the prohibited way. 

MR. SCALIA: Your Honor, I agree with 

much of that, that these burden-shifting schemes 

have been developed to get at both causation but 

also intent.  But, ultimately, both also are 

required as part of the plaintiff's case. 

I'm simply unaware of any decision 

under Title VII on which this was plainly framed 

where intent was not also something that the 

plaintiff had to show. 

And, remember, under Title VII's 

motivating factor, again, the plaintiff who 

shows that wins.  Now they may not get 

reinstatement or back pay, but they've won. 

They get attorneys' fees and -- and -- and --

and they have shown a violation. 

This statute operates the same way. 

It's quite unusual to think that those -- that

 burden-shifting operates to produce that result 

with causation suddenly just becoming combined

 with intent and not simply asking the jury to

 make a separate finding --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Could I --

MR. SCALIA: -- on that point.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- could I ask a 

question then about how the case -- this case

 and usual cases develop?  Someone engages in 

protected activity or a report of misconduct and 

then a few weeks later, a few months later, is 

fired. 

Then the case goes to the litigation 

and the jury, and the plaintiff says:  I was 

fired because I engaged in the protected 

activity.  The employer, as here, comes in and 

says: No, we fired you because you were a poor 

performer or because we had money issues and 

needed to eliminate the position. 

Then, at that point and in this case, 

in the closing arguments, you know, your counsel 

said you're going to hear two different versions 

of -- of events. And then the -- Murray's 

counsel got up and said, you just heard a 

speech.  It was a slick presentation for sure,

 In other words, the jury had to decide 

between two different versions of events, which 

the burden was on you to show that your version 

was correct, but you were able to present to the 

jury this idea that no, we didn't do it, we 

didn't intend to do it because of the protected

 activity.  We did it for another reason, right?

 Didn't that defense get to the jury? 

MR. SCALIA: Yes, it -- it did, Your 

Honor, although the way, of course, these 

instructions functioned, first of all, they got 

there by just showing that the protected 

activity tended to affect in any way --

instruction on that.  But put that aside.  The 

ultimate question was who's telling the truth

 have -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's point, I'm

 sorry to interrupt, but the -- the employer will

 have the information that shows, okay, we fired 

10 other employees as well who hadn't engaged in 

the protected activity for the same reason.

 Or here's our list of performance 

ratings and, see, we fired these other people 

who had the same performance rating.  That's how 

the employer wins these cases, but they -- the 

employer has the information. 

Once you put that in, then the jury,

has to figure out is that enough to show that 

the protected activity wasn't the -- you know,

is where Petitioner's counsel began. 

And then, with respect to the 

instruction, what the judge did was first sent 

the jury back to her original instruction about 

"tend to affect in any way."  And although she 

used words that took "tend" out, she still --

still said "affect any way."  And there was 

evidence here that the employee's direct 

manager, who had supposedly received the 

whistleblowing complaint, actually tried to find 

him another position.

 what, a but-for cause, a motivating cause, some

 cause? What would -- what would you do -- what

 would you ask the jury to decide before this

 burden-shifting scheme entered the picture?

 MR. SCALIA: Justice Alito, the way 

that is typically done, should be done, is to

 show that it played some role in furthering, in 

bringing about the adverse action. That's a 

proper, I think, description of contributing 

factor.  It's not the one that was given. It's 

one the government has now begun using but had 

not been used with the jury.  But not 

motivating.  It's recognized that contributing 

is a lower level than motivating. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that sounds like 

you're -- you're working your argument about 

discriminatory intent into the burden-shifting 

framework, not requiring something outside the 

burden-shifting framework. 

MR. SCALIA: It is outside.  This is a 

question about the impact of the protected 

activity.  Did it contribute, did it further the 

decision that was made?  Separately is the 

instruction to be given regarding whether there

employer intended for the protected activity to 

be a contributing factor. 

That's a sensible statute.  But, if 

that were the statute, you don't need the second 

step of the burden-shifting analysis.  You've 

already done everything that the second step of 

the burden-shifting analysis does.

step of the burden-shifting analysis is 

precisely to make that determination of whether 

the employer actually acted in part or in whole 

for that reason, understanding that the employer 

has the information, and so it makes sense to 

put that question on the employer's side of who 

has the burden to do what.

 MR. SCALIA: But, respectfully, 

Justice Kagan, as I've sought to explain, the 

second step does not discern the employer's 

retaliatory motive or the absence of it.  The 

Petitioner is saying that's where it's 

determined.  But, remember, the employer that 

has a retaliatory motive can still win there. 

And, as I've explained, the employer that lacks 

it can still lose. 

So that's not the step at which it's 

ascertained whether there is retaliatory intent. 

What's ascertained there is whether this action 

would have been taken even in the absence of the 

protected activity, including that intent.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  One question,

 Mr. Scalia.  I want to pose a variation of the

 question that Justice Gorsuch asked your friends 

on the other side. If we disagreed with you

 that intent was an independent element and we

 think intent, as Justice Kagan was just 

suggesting, is wrapped into the burden-shifting 

framework, would you like us to just stop there,

 or do you think it would be valuable to say 

something more about the contributing factor in 

the burden-shifting test? 

MR. SCALIA: Certainly, we think the 

Court should proceed to address the second 

issue. That has been briefed by the parties. 

It was integral to the court's decision below. 

If you read where it -- it said that there had 

to be retaliatory intent -- by the way, 

retaliatory intent, it did not say there had to 

be animus.  If you read that, immediately in the 

same place, it explained the problems with the 

instruction that was being given.  That is a 

widely used instruction that the government has 

backed away from here. So has Petitioner.

amount unsettled in whistleblower law if you do

 Jackson?

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And would we also

 cover how you would go about proving the

is just a short question -- which is ordinarily 

my understanding is that a burden-shifting test 

is used precisely because of the reasons that 

Justice Kagan pointed out, that we don't require 

sort of direct evidence of what is in -- in the 

head of an employer. 

So, if this is a separate element, are 

you suggesting that we have two burden-shifting 

tests operating in this environment, one that 

relates to causation and uses the contributing 

factor and another that relates to intent and I 

guess uses motivating or but-for or because or 

something? 

MR. SCALIA: No.  We are suggesting 

just a single burden shift still, which is, as 

we've explained, a defense to relief.  But the

require the plaintiff to bring direct evidence 

of this intent? It couldn't do it during the --

MR. SCALIA: Not at all, Justice 

Jackson.  There would need to be a finding of 

intent, but that can be inferred from 

circumstantial evidence.  We would not require 

direct evidence. We're merely saying that it 

would be so remarkable under a discrimination 

statute or a retaliation statute to find a 

violation, as SOX does, without even finding 

that there was retaliatory intent.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EASHA ANAND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. ANAND: Thank you, Your Honor.

 I want to start by addressing Justice 

Kagan's question about the relationship between 

our position and the SG's position.

 So we agree on two key things.  First,

 "contributing factor" cannot include an animus 

requirement, and it cannot include retaliatory 

intent to the extent that means something more 

than the JA 180 language of "affects the 

decision." 

Second, the burden-shifting framework 

is how you capture discrimination.  And I don't 

think I heard my friend on the other side give 

you an example of why Justice Gorsuch's proposed 

instruction, which is step 2 of the 

burden-shifting framework, doesn't adequately 

capture -- doesn't adequately exclude innocent 

employers, setting aside the 

clear-and-convincing-evidence standard, which, 

of course, was Congress's prerogative. 

And this Court has already held that's 

what discrimination mean, right? That's --

that's Bostock.  Discrimination has occurred if

changing the employee's sex would have yielded a

 different choice.  That's Abercrombie.  Three 

elements for discriminate, adverse action, 

because of protected activity. So you're not --

you're not breaking any new ground here. And 

I'm happy to explain Staub and Halliburton that 

my friend on the other side cited if there are

 questions about those.

 To the extent this Court is inclined 

to decide between the JA 130 formulation, which 

is "tends to affect in any way," which is our 

preferred formulation, or the JA 180 "affects 

the decision in any way," and, again, I don't 

think you need to do that because both 

instructions were in this case, but to the 

extent this Court is inclined to choose between 

them, I'd like to say a few words on why I think 

the JA 130 formulation is the preferred one. 

So, first, the statute notably doesn't 

say "contributing factor in the decision."  And 

that's notable because, as the SG's Office 

explained, Mt. Healthy does use the "in the 

decision" formulation, so it's notable that 

Congress chose not to use that. 

Second, this would collapse the

difference between contributing and motivating

 factor, right?  So motivating factor, Price

 Waterhouse.  If we ask the decisionmaker to list

 the reasons and they were truthful, the

 protected trait would be on that list.  That's

 basically saying it's a contributing factor in 

the decision. And Congress chose to use

 "contributing factor" and not "motivating

 factor" in this context. 

And, third, Marano seems to have 

defined this authoritatively a generation ago. 

Congress was well aware of that definition when 

it incorporated it into SOX. 

So, again, for us to win, you just 

have to say no animus and contributing factor 

and no retaliatory intent to the extent it means 

more than "affects the decision," and 

burden-shifting framework is all you need to 

show to get at discrimination. 

If you want to go further and choose 

between these two instructions, I've given you 

my position on why the JA 130 formulation is 

preferable.
