 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument next in Case 141 on the original

 docket, Texas against New Mexico and Colorado.

 Mr. Liu. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 MR. LIU: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

A consent decree requires consent. 

The proposed consent decree in this case, 

however, would dispose of the United States' 

claims without its consent.  The decree would 

impose obligations on the United States without 

its consent.  And the decree would bind the 

United States to an interpretation of the Rio 

Grande Compact that is contrary to the Compact 

itself.  For each of those reasons, the proposed 

decree should be rejected. 

I want to emphasize why the United 

States is here today.  The Compact apportions 

the water below Elephant Butte.  The Compact 

does so by incorporating and protecting the 

delivery of water by the Rio Grande Project to

Mexico and to two irrigation districts, one in 

New Mexico and the other in Texas. The United 

States intervened in this case to enforce the

 Compact's protection of the project.

 As New Mexico acknowledges, the 

Compact imposes on New Mexico a duty not to 

interfere with the Project's delivery of water. 

The United States claims that New Mexico is 

violating that duty by allowing too much 

groundwater pumping. 

Six years ago, this Court upheld the 

United States' right to pursue those Compact 

claims, recognizing that the United States has 

distinctively federal interests in protecting 

the supply and the allocation of Project water. 

Those distinctively federal interests are why 

the United States is still here today. 

In the United States' view, the 

proposed decree fails to address the groundwater 

pumping that precipitated this suit in the first 

place. Instead, the proposed decree would allow 

that pumping to continue at unsustainable 

levels, and it would not stop that pumping from 

taking water from the Project's beneficiaries, 

namely, the two irrigation districts and -- and

-- and Mexico.

 The proposed decree would thus fail to 

protect the Project or the Compact's 

apportionment, and that is why the United States

 could not give its consent to this proposed

 decree.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Liu, does the 

United States have a claim that's independent of 

the states'? 

MR. LIU: Of course we do, Justice 

Thomas. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What is -- what is 

that claim? 

MR. LIU: That's the claim that we've 

brought since the beginning of this case. It's 

the claim that this Court held in 2018 is a 

claim we -- that's backed by distinctively 

federal interests.  It's a claim that says New 

Mexico is violating its delivery obligation 

under the Compact. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Is that a claim that 

we would normally look at in an original action, 

or is that a claim that could be vindicated in 

another forum?

MR. LIU: It's not a claim that can be

 vindicated in another forum.  I think it's 

actually a perfect fit for this -- this Court's

 original jurisdiction because it is a claim 

arising under an interstate commerce that we

 have brought against another sovereign state. 

That's precisely the sort of disputes that I 

think this Court has long held is appropriate 

for this Court to arise -- to -- to exercise 

original jurisdiction over. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  You're an intervene 

-- the U.S. is an intervenor, right? 

MR. LIU: Correct. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  When you intervened, 

I thought our understanding was that you were --

your -- your interest was consistent with that 

of the State of Texas? 

MR. LIU: Yes. And our -- and to be 

clear, our underlying claims are exactly the 

same as they were --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, but Texas and 

New Mexico -- and it's rare that we have the 

states who actually agree on anything -- but 

Texas and New Mexico have agreed.  So what -- if 

your interest is the same as Texas's interest,

MR. LIU: Well, I -- I think, if you 

look at the operative complaints in this case, 

the -- the relief we're seeking here is the same 

as the relief that Texas is seeking.  What's 

changed since the 2018 decision isn't a change 

in the nature of the claims.  Our claims --

Texas and the United States are still pursuing 

the same claims. 

What's changed is a difference in 

litigating position.  And I don't read the 

Court's paragraph, that passage you just read,

the United States has different interests than 

Texas. That's what New Mexico told the Court, 

what Colorado did, what the United States told

 the Court.  And we reiterated it at oral 

argument, that the interests were different.

not. And that's just --

 correct.  Under reclamation law, we have 

contracts with the two irrigation districts that

this consent decree is that it would impose 

obligations on us that are actually contrary to

 water law. This consent decree is an agreement 

between two states that they wish to have

8 of the Reclamation Act has nothing to say

what we want. We want the same thing we wanted 

in 2018 when this -- this Court approved our

 claim. So the easiest way to -- to understand 

this is to break down the elements of our claim,

 duty, breach, remedy.

 With respect to duty, we want the 

Court to recognize that New Mexico has a duty of

 non-interference with respect to the Project. 

The problem with this consent decree is that 

instead of recognizing that duty of 

non-interference, it gives the states a right to 

interfere with the Project by forcing water --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you -- do you want 

the 1938 baseline? 

MR. LIU: We do.  And that goes to the 

second element of breach.  We -- we came in --

we -- we, since -- since this Court's 2018 

decision, have litigated alongside Texas all the 

way -- partway through a trial that the right 

baseline against which to measure New Mexico's 

interference was a 1938 baseline. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you want this why? 

Because you think what will happen?  Are your 

treaty obligations at stake?  Are you just 

fearful that the water districts won't have the

water that they need?  What -- what's the

 thought here?  And -- and, again, what's your 

understanding of why you and Texas diverge?

 MR. LIU: Yes, it's -- it's -- it's --

our concerns here go to both the supply of

 Project water and its allocation.  We are

 concerned that the groundwater pumping is 

occurring at unsustainable levels, which will 

have a devastating effect over the long term on 

the supply of Project water, and that will mean 

down the road that we might not have enough 

water to meet irrigation demands in the 

districts and in Mexico. 

We're also concerned about the 

allocation of water, and by that, I mean the 

allocation is currently accomplished through the 

downstream contracts that the government has 

entered into and the treaty with Mexico. 

What this consent decree does is 

replace that division of water with a division 

of the state's own making. 

As to why Texas has basically 

capitulated its position in this case, it was --

everyone agreed in -- in its complaint it was 

looking for a 1938 baseline when it filed the

 MR. LIU: No. One is in New Mexico

 and one is in Texas. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  All right.  And 

so they are -- do you think they -- they have a 

right to assert an interest that's inconsistent 

with that's -- that's asserted by their states? 

MR. LIU: They do with respect to 

their relationship to the federal government. 

This Court has long recognized that the parens 

patriae principle extends only to the states' 

representation of their own citizens with 

respect to state interests. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's what's 

involved?  Is that what's involved?  New Mexico 

and Texas are not treating these particular 

districts fairly? 

MR. LIU: I think that's part of the 

problem.

JUSTICE ALITO:  What else is -- what's

 the rest of the problem?

 MR. LIU: The other part of the 

problem is that the level of groundwater pumping

 at the D-2 level is in our view unsustainable in 

the long term, and so the -- the -- the

 long-term viability of the Project itself is at

 risk.

 I mean, when -- when we talk about the 

districts, they're -- I -- I want to spell out 

why -- why we think they're being treated 

unfairly.  I mean, the Reclamation Act of 1902 

reflects a basic bargain between reclamation and 

irrigation districts. 

On the United States' end of the 

bargain, we promised to build the major 

infrastructure, the dams and the reservoirs, and 

to deliver water to meet irrigation needs in the 

districts. 

On the other end of the bargain, the 

districts agreed to pay construction, operation, 

and maintenance costs to defray the costs that 

the United States invested into the Project. 

And what this consent decree does is 

just undermine that bargain because what happens

 under the consent decree is that the district in 

New Mexico bears the brunt of any continued or

 increased pumping in New Mexico.

 What happens under the decree is, if 

groundwater pumping remains the same or goes up,

 what New Mexico can choose to do is to force the 

United States to transfer water from the New

 Mexico district to Texas.

 And so what happens is the one 

district in New Mexico that actually has a 

contract with the United States, that has paid 

millions of dollars in construction charges and 

continues to pay hundreds of thousands of 

dollars each year in operation and maintenance, 

they bear the brunt of groundwater pumping.  The 

ones who are entitled --

Project was already in existence. And one of 

the fundamental purposes of the Compact -- and 

this is repeated at least three times in Texas's

 own complaint -- one of the fundamental purposes

 of the Compact was to protect the Project, to 

make sure that the Project had a sufficient

 supply of water to fulfill the United States' 

obligations under the contracts and the treaty. 

Again, it would have been -- it would 

have been strange for Congress and the President

respect the obligations that the United States 

already had or that put them at risk.

arguments is disposing of the claims.  The other 

is the impermissible imposition of duties on --

on the United States.  And I -- and you

 there really is no change in the status of the

 United States.

 MR. LIU: Yeah. All the changes go to

 the heart of the Project's operations.  I would

 first point you to the provisions of the consent 

decree. This is at the addendum to the third 

report, pages 12 to 17. That would allow the 

states to force the United States to transfer 

water from one district to another at the 

state's direction. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  That's already 

happening to some degree, but you're saying it's 

going to be different if the consent decree goes 

on? 

MR. LIU: It's going to be different 

in the important sense that we are doing -- we 

-- we are allocating water as -- on a consensual 

basis between the United States and the two 

districts, as we always have since 1906, done so 

on a consensual -- that's the meaning of a 

contract, on a consensual basis. 

And what this would do is force the 

United States to transfer water at certain times 

and places.  And that just flips the -- the --

determinants of how the allocation works would

 be the United States and the districts.  Now

 what determines the allocation is what the 

states tell us the -- allocation should be.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there -- and I

 think this goes back to Justice Thomas's 

original question, but is there another forum in 

which you can raise these arguments and get what 

-- get the remedy that you're seeking? 

MR. LIU: There's not. And to start 

with, to think about it in -- in terms of 

sources of substantive law, as far as seeking 

the same relief under the Compact, we don't read 

the consent decree and no one else reads the 

consent decree as allowing us to bring any 

Compact claims that would call into question the 

validity of the decree.  So we would be stuck 

with the decree's view of what is compliance 

with the Compact. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That that would be 

preclusive on the question of what the Compact 

requires?

states' own reply in this Court says the consent 

decree will be "part of the constellation of

 laws" that the United States will follow.  I

 think that means that we have to treat the 

consent decree as if it were the Compact itself.

 Now, thinking about other sources of 

law, there's state law, there's reclamation law. 

I don't think either of those bodies of law is 

going to somehow compensate for the loss of our 

Compact claims.  Those are claims not brought 

against New Mexico but against individual water 

users. They are claims that hinge on a 

definition of Project water. 

So, for example, under state law, I 

suppose we'd be in the position of arguing that 

Project water has a certain definition that 

includes the water that's being taken away.  But 

my guess is that if we were to try to litigate 

in that -- that in state court, the response 

from the other side would be:  Well, given that 

the Compact doesn't protect that water under the 

consent decree, it's not really your water, and 

so we wouldn't have any basis for the state law 

or the reclamation law claims.  Those claims 

rest on a -- on a -- on a concept of Project

 Thomas?

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Liu, if we -- if 

-- had not gone along with the United States in 

your efforts to intervene in this, would you be 

able to vindicate those rights that you're

 talking about?  Because I don't remember that --

the argument you're making now, a sort of 

apocalyptic argument, being made in 2018. 

MR. LIU: No, I don't think those 

interests could be vindicated elsewhere for the 

reasons I gave Justice Kagan.  I don't think the 

condition of this -- I don't think what I've 

presented here is apocalyptic.  It is simply a 

reflection of paragraph 14 of the United States' 

original complaint in this case, which lays out 

the -- the fairly simple chain of causation that 

goes from groundwater being taken out of the 

ground, leading to less water in Project 

storage, leading to less water for the -- the 

beneficiaries of the Project.

that much of your argument before was that you

 were on the same page as, say -- as Texas.  And

 it seems like there's a divergence of -- of

 interests now.

 MR. LIU: Well, we -- there was always

 divergent interests.  I mean, the parties

 themselves -- we did, New Mexico, Colorado --

pointed out that even though we were pursuing 

the same claims, we were doing so for different 

interests.  In fact, the argument was, if -- if 

we're just pursuing the same claims for the same 

interests, we should just be left to be amicus 

in this case, and whatever Texas decides to do 

with its claims we would then be stuck with, 

just tagging along as amicus. 

But I -- I understood the point of the 

Court's decision to be -- and this is on page 

413 -- that the United States has distinctively 

federal interests, not interests that are merely 

derivative of Texas's. 

And I think, in this case, we kind of 

have run a natural experiment of what happens 

when the United States' interests are cut out of 

the picture.  The results are not good. The 

result is a consent decree that really does

not anticipate that they would abandon you --

MR. LIU: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in the middle 

of this litigation.  You did anticipate --

that's why you wanted to intervene -- that there 

were distinct federal interests that needed to 

be protected? 

MR. LIU: Right.

interests remain the same?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Liu, I guess my 

concern, you know, at bottom is this, that our 

original jurisdiction is to -- for litigation 

between states.  That's what it's -- that's what 

our charge is from Article III. 

And we have a -- an -- a consent 

decree between two states.  They agree.  The 

Special Master's found that that agreement is 

consistent with their Compact and doesn't 

purport to settle any claims that the federal 

government might have. In fact, says those are 

just not part of this case, dismissed without 

prejudice to be pursued in another forum. 

To now say that the federal government 

has independent litigating authority in cases 

that are supposed to be between two states and 

that -- not resolve the federal government's

 this Court's original jurisdiction not just in

 this case but potentially with ramifications

 going forward.

 Thoughts?

 MR. LIU: Well, I think those concerns 

can be cashed out at this Court's initial

 gatekeeping stage just -- so, in other words,

 those concerns can be cashed out when the Court 

takes up the issue of whether the United States 

can intervene and pursue the claims. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And that's -- that's 

kind of why you've made me regret that, because 

the representation then was, we're -- we're 

fully aligned with one of the states here and we 

can add material value in the understanding of 

the case.  I get that, I do, sort of still.

 MR. LIU: I -- I think they could. 

And we gave an example in -- in our briefs. 

Texas, for example, could agree to dismiss its 

claims, and, in return, New Mexico could agree

 to either curtail the groundwater pumping or 

offset it, and if you look at the -- the 

declaration by -- by Hammond in -- in -- in 

the -- in the record, it -- it -- it lists a 

host of ways that New Mexico could offset the 

amount of groundwater pumping. 

And that sort of agreement, which is 

simply an agreement by New Mexico that says 

we're going to take care of groundwater pumping, 

doesn't dispose of the United States' claims in 

this case or impose any obligations on the 

United States.

prefer rather than the one the parties prefer?

or something else entirely.

 This Court has repeatedly admonished

 states to figure out such issues amongst

 themselves because -- and I'm quoting from a

 different Texas against New Mexico -- "they are 

more likely to be wisely solved through

 cooperative study than in any court however

 constituted."

 We heard you, we listened, and we 

complied.  None of the three reasons the United 

States insists require Texas and New Mexico to 

nonetheless continue litigating holds water. 

Their objection that the Compact -- that the 

consent decree violates the Compact ignores that 

this Court has encouraged states to clarify 

technical issues such as the baseline condition 

and accept that solution so long as it is 

reasonable and does not contradict the Compact's 

express terms. 

We know the decree easily meets that 

standard because it merely tweaks a methodology 

the United States developed in the late 1970s. 

Their next objection collapses into the first 

because it is the Compact that requires the 

United States to deliver and account for Texas's

water. The decree merely allows the arrival of

 that water to be measured with greater

 precision.

 Finally -- and this is the objection 

that has been the focus today -- their claims

 objection would transform this entire lawsuit 

from one about how much water the Compact 

guarantees Texas to what New Mexico will do to

 meet that guarantee. 

Such disputes are not yet ripe, and, 

more fundamentally, as Justice Gorsuch noted, 

under the Reclamation Act of 1902, they present 

complex issues of New Mexico state law that 

neither interest Texas nor belong in the first 

instance in this Court. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do we review consent 

decrees in original actions different from 

consent decrees in other article -- other cases? 

MS. PETTIT: I believe that's an open 

question, Your Honor, in the original

case in this Court over the objection of the

 original states.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  The Special Master 

seemed to have a different view of where the --

U.S. could vindicate its rights. It indicated 

that the U.S. could use another forum to do

 that. 

Do you have a view on that? 

MS. PETTIT: We agree with the Special 

Master that they can and should vindicate their 

current claims in New Mexico state or federal 

court. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what do you say 

to what Mr. Liu just said? Mr. Liu said this is 

going to be preclusive as to what the Compact 

means, what it requires, and there's no other 

way, no other body of law that's going to be 

able to get around that, so you effectively are 

precluding the government's position in this 

case. 

MS. PETTIT: It won't be preclusive in 

the sense of claim preclusion.  It will resolve 

a single question, which is that the baseline

 agree that that would be binding on the United

 States.

 However, I would point this Court to 

its 1935 decision in Nebraska against Wyoming, 

which, contrary to what my friend in the United 

States said, treats the United States as 

equivalent to all other appropriators for that

 purpose. 

The Compact agreement is binding on 

them as a force of Congress's choice from --

starting from the 19th Century that the federal 

law will defer to -- to state law in this unique 

circumstance.

permitted, as they're asking, to litigate that 

question and they lose it. Well, they've lost

 something different.  You're saying the Compact

 settles that question.  They're stuck with it.

 MS. PETTIT: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that --

you've given your whole case away?

 MS. PETTIT: No, Your Honor.  The

 Nebraska case was also settled, and the Court 

did not even allow the -- the particular 

complaint -- the particular opinion I was citing 

was actually an opinion saying that the United 

States was not even a necessary party because, 

under Congress's choice, that they would be 

bound by state law. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- I think there 

are compacts and then again there are compacts. 

You know, there are compacts that really do 

involve only the states and don't have 

distinctively federal interests attached to 

them, and this contact -- Compact is not that 

and for all the reasons we gave six years ago. 

"First, the Compact is inextricably 

intertwined with the Rio Grande Project and the 

Downstream Contracts," which, of course, are 

federal in nature.

Second, "the United States plays an 

integral role in the Compact's operation."

 "Third, a breach of the Compact could 

jeopardize the federal government's ability to 

satisfy its treaty obligations." 

So this is a Compact that really the

 federal government is right in the mix of, and 

that's why we allow the federal government to

 participate. 

MS. PETTIT: Your Honor, I would agree 

that there is a spectrum of compacts, but this 

is not on the far end of it.  In fact, the 

United States is a actual party to the Delaware 

Compact because -- or the Delaware River Compact 

for precisely that concern. 

This falls more in the middle.  And as 

-- in the Michael Sullivan declaration, I 

believe, gives examples all over the -- the West 

about areas where compacts use reserve --

reclamation projects in the ways contemplated 

here. And it -- it would be no different.

 And for you to say you can -- you

 know, once -- after we've said there are these

 distinctive federal interests and the U.S. gets 

to participate as an intervenor, for you to cut 

the U.S. out of the picture entirely so that the 

U.S. can't ask a court to litigate those, what

rules, I mean, I -- I guess I don't see where 

that authority comes from. 

MS. PETTIT: From -- for the right 

rules point, my -- I believe my friend actually 

-- acknowledged that whether or not they were an 

intervenor was irrelevant to that question.  It 

either complies with the Compact or it does not. 

And as to their specific claims -- and 

I think this really goes to focusing on how 

their claims have actually evolved since 2018, 

because in -- in 2018, they were asserting a 

interference with a treaty and an interference 

with Texas's apportionment. 

Here, they're -- the -- and the 

Special Master recognized that there is no 

evidence about the -- a potential interference 

with the treaty at all, in part because this

 treaty's not -- so, as a result, the treaty is

 not implicated.

 And -- and then they're saying, well,

 I'm demanding on behalf of Texas more than Texas

 is going to -- is -- is demanding for itself. 

That doesn't make a lot of sense. And so what 

they've really tried to do here is they've tried 

to conflate the Project and the consent -- and 

the Compact, and they are two analytically 

separate things. 

What they're asserting here is -- is 

an interference with the Project in New Mexico 

that is a matter of reclamation law and that is 

typically resolved in the lower courts. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I mean, you say 

they're two separate things, and six years ago, 

we said they're inextricably intertwined. 

MS. PETTIT: In the sense that the --

the Project acted as a -- as a sort of agent, is 

I believe the words this Court used, in term --

but not in the sense that every single violation 

of the Project or every single potential 

interference with the Project rises to the level 

of a Compact violation.

For example, if there were a well in 

New Mexico that was being operated in a way 

inconsistent with the Project, that might be a

 violation under the Reclamation Act, but it's

 not going to be a violation of the Compact.  So

 they can't be -- just because one serves as the 

agent of the other doesn't mean that they can't 

-- that they are not analytically distinct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a 

theoretical question about how it works, and 

maybe everybody else knows, but my understanding 

of how this works is you have -- compacts and 

the federal interest is protected because of the 

requirement of congressional consent. 

But what happens as they go on?  I 

mean -- and -- and you have a consent decree 

under the Compact, but at what point does the 

federal government have the authority to step in 

as they do when the Compact is originally 

enacted? 

MS. PETTIT: In that instance, Your 

Honor, I think it would -- and I'd point you to

modification of the Compact.

determined that it was a reasonable

 interpretation, in part because it is the 

interpretation that, as my friend noted, both

 the United States and the two districts have 

agreed upon since the late 1970s.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what

 happens -- the federal government says a problem 

here is they're not going to be able to meet

 their treaty obligations with Mexico.  What --

what if that happens?  What -- do you have any 

obligations at that point, or do you just tell 

the United States to, you know, go to war with 

Mexico? 

MS. PETTIT: I certainly wouldn't tell 

the United States to go to war with Mexico, Your 

Honor. I believe, in -- in those circumstances, 

because their claims as they've articulated them 

today, and they have been a little fluid, is 

that -- is New Mexico is pumping too much water, 

what they would do is bring a Reclamation Act 

claim in New Mexico. 

And they are actually a party to 

ongoing litigation along those lines in the 

stream adjudication that they've been trying to 

get out of for decades to -- precisely to

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that would 

be your answer to the question I was -- I think 

was asked earlier about what should the United 

States do, and you would say they should sue New 

Mexico or, presumably, they'll find you too in 

-- you're not going to be in state court but in 

federal court, and that would be resolved there? 

MS. PETTIT: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I --

MS. PETTIT: And --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- can I ask you, in 

-- in such an action, wouldn't New Mexico point 

to the consent decree and say we're not doing 

the wrong thing because, let's say, we adopt --

or approved the consent decree?  Wouldn't the 

defense be here's the consent decree and it 

tells us how much water we can pump? 

MS. PETTIT: It depends on what 

precisely their allegations are, which is why 

the -- these claims are not yet ripe. All the 

consent decree does is it specifies how much 

water New Mexico is entitled to. And the treaty 

obligation is taken out before they ever get to

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why isn't that

 the same thing?  If New Mexico is saying -- you

 know, if -- if the federal government's claim in

 the Reclamation -- hypothetical Reclamation Act 

lawsuit is that New Mexico is taking too much

 water --

MS. PETTIT: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- and New Mexico's 

response is no, we're not because the consent 

decree tells us how much water we're entitled 

to, I guess I don't understand why that isn't --

the consent decree doesn't impact the United 

States' claims. 

MS. PETTIT: And I think that I would 

point Your Honor to the explanation that they 

gave the Special Master in October and December 

of 2022 about what their nature of their claims 

are. And it's really a question -- it's not 

really a question of New Mexico as a whole 

taking too much water.  It's particular New 

Mexicans, so people who are not Project contract 

users who are pumping when they shouldn't be. 

That's the type of claim that would be 

appropriate.  It's a purely --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it can't be 

because we go back to your earlier concession.

 What the -- this consent decree says is the 1938 

baseline is not how you interpret this contract.

 Whether the Special Master will 

ultimately disagree with their position or not, 

if they are not able to litigate that the 1938 

baseline is what needs to be measured, then the

 pumping would be illegal. 

MS. PETTIT: Not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the baseline 

has been changed, then the pumping is going to 

be from a different baseline.  And so their 

reclamation -- claims are being limited.  The 

extent of how much they can get is being limited 

by you. 

MS. PETTIT: Your Honor, I have two 

responses.  The first is that the United States 

has not actually attempted to litigate a 1938 

condition in this case.  In fact, the Special 

Master -- and this is his words, not mine, on 

page 71 of the February 6th, 2023, transcript --

"I don't know how the U.S. is maintaining that 

with a straight face," because, as recently as 

the summary judgment motion, they disclaimed a

1938 baseline.

 Beyond that, the type of pumping that 

they are talking about and the concerns they are

 being -- are saying and one of the reasons they

 raised that it was unfair was that this -- that 

-- that EBID, the district in New Mexico, was

 going to bear the brunt for people outside of --

of that area, so people farther upstream.  That

 is the nature of the -- of the claims they are 

trying to litigate now, is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we'll see. 

I -- they'll have to get up and answer that 

because I can't, but we'll see. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just direct 

your attention to the other objection?  Because, 

on the one hand, they say part of the reason 

this is a problem is that you are disposing of 

our claims.  I also understood them to say you 

are imposing obligations. 

So I guess my question is, to what 

extent do you see this -- see the -- the consent 

decree as binding on the United States? 

MS. PETTIT: It's not binding in the 

sense of a -- that we can seek contempt for 

violating it.  It is binding, as we were

discussing a few minutes ago, as to the

 definition of the baseline.

 The obligations that they are pointing

 to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could

 finish your answer.

 MS. PETTIT: -- are -- are three 

specific concerns. One is the gauge, which is 

actually contemplated by the Compact itself in 

Article II and Article V, that we can move 

gauges. 

The second is an accounting issue that 

it -- that falls within the scope of the 

accounting that already happens because what's 

accounting that it's talking about here is not 

the day-to-day operation of the project; it is 

an end-of-the-year assessment about whether the 

Compact has been violated.  They're two 

different things. 

And the third is a transfer of -- of 

allotments between districts over -- at the end 

-- the beginning of each year. That would be 

enforced against the districts.

Mr. Liu said it was inexplicable why

 you gave up the 1938 baseline. Can you explain

 that?

 MS. PETTIT: Certainly, Your Honor.

 The nature of a settlement is that parties

 compromise.  And the -- the Special Master

 determined at the summary judgment stage that 

there wasn't a strict 1938 condition as the --

as Texas originally pled it. There was some 

additional amount of development that had been 

contemplated. 

And taking -- we accepted that as a 

fundamental matter, and going forward, looking 

at the evidence and looking at the different 

claims, we concluded that this was in Texas's 

best interests.

 an -- could you explain why that happened and on

 what basis did -- did -- did this happen?

 MS. PETTIT: I --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  The government seemed 

-- the U.S. seems to put quite a bit of emphasis

 on that.

 MS. PETTIT: Two responses.  The first 

is going back to 2018, ironically, General 

Keller, when he was standing at this lectern, 

predicted that there would be a divergence about 

the baseline, but he got the positions 

backwards.  He was -- he was asserting that 

Texas would be asserting a 1938 condition and 

the U.S. would be asserting a D-2.  And that's 

actually how it's been litigated up until the 

exceptions.  So that's -- that's changed. 

The other thing that's changed is, 

again, they are trying to bring into this 

lawsuit intrastate issues within New Mexico that 

Texas actually never agreed to that were 

appropriately part of its lawsuit back in 2018.

Who set up that process?

 MS. PETTIT: There are two different

 processes.  One is run by the Rio Grande Compact

 Commission.  That is the Compact Compliance. 

And the other is the accounting process for the

 Project itself.  And those run in parallel.

 They only really meet at the end -- at basically

 an end-of-the-year meeting, where Texas and New 

Mexico, as well as Colorado, would be telling 

them you need -- there's a credit or a debit 

that needs to be put into your accounting system 

and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that --

MS. PETTIT:  -- it's functionally the 

same thing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but -- but who 

set up what would be reported or how? 

MS. PETTIT: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The two projects, 

not the states, correct? 

MS. PETTIT: They are -- it's -- this 

is cooperative federalism.  They work together 

about this.  And they work together on an 

ongoing basis.  So I can't --

problem is that now you're directing the federal

 government to do something different.  Whether 

it's de minimis or not, I can't even figure that 

out in reading the materials.

 But, when we had the opposite

 situation of the federal -- one sovereign, the 

federal government, telling the states to do 

background checks on gun buyers, we said that's

 stepping into their sovereign decision-making 

and couldn't. 

I don't know why this is not the same 

in reverse, that you're commanding the federal 

government to do something that it had not done 

previously.  So where do you get the power to do 

that? 

You claim the power is because they've 

undertaken the duty to do this, but they took a 

duty to do this, get -- retaining the right to 

make certain decisions.  Now you're chasing that 

baseline. 

MS. PETTIT: The Reclamation Act of 

1902 stated that the states can put -- the 

federal government takes its water rights 

subject to both the procedural and substantive 

requirements of the states, and that can

And I do want to point out that that

 me -- against the districts.  Is that in the

 Compact -- or in the consent decree? Is that --

or is that just something you're saying here

 now?

 MS. PETTIT: That -- that's not

 specifically in the consent decree.  That is,

 however -- the way that the transfers work is, 

to take a specific example, if a negative 

departure transfer were triggered, that would 

mean over a period of years, EBID, the New 

Mexico District, has received far, far more 

water than it was entitled to, and that would be 

a transfer -- that would be transferred to Texas 

as a -- the Texas District as a way of a remedy. 

If the EBID were to continue to take 

more water than it was entitled to even after 

that, that would be enforced through a New 

Mexico state administrative process that's part 

of the larger constellation of laws that my 

friend mentioned and is not specifically in the

 Mr. Wechsler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY J. WECHSLER 

ON BEHALF OF NEW MEXICO

 MR. WECHSLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 The question of whether the United 

States can veto the settlement of the Compacting

 states can be resolved by the application of 

four principles. 

First, the distinctively federal 

interests of the United States do not include an 

interest in the equitable apportionment of Rio 

Grande water.  That is undisputed.  Because the 

only issue resolved by the consent decree is the 

equitable apportionment, the United States' 

interests are not implicated. 

Second, the Compact establishes the 

apportionment.  The Rio Grande Project must then 

conform its operations to ensure that the 

Compact apportionment is delivered. 

Third, this Court has recognized the 

right of states to clarify an ambiguity in an

consent decree measures Texas's share of the 

Article IV delivery in a manner that is

 expressly contemplated by the Compact.

 And, fourth, there are other available 

fora for the United States to resolve its

 remaining claims.  The Special Master observed 

that "it is difficult to envision a resolution 

to this matter that might be superior to the

 consent decree." 

The Court should overrule the United 

States' exception and enter the consent decree. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Could you -- the --

one of the -- the -- the State of Texas -- the 

United States seemed to suggest that Texas and 

the -- the states have changed their views from 

early -- from 2018, and we've had some 

discussion of that.  I'd like to hear your 

comments on that. 

MR. WECHSLER:  Well, United -- New 

Mexico has been consistent about its position in 

terms of the D-2 baseline.  What I -- what we 

understood the 2018 decision to be doing is 

essentially saying Texas had a claim to the 

apportionment.  That is an interstate

Only those states are in the -- the Compact

 itself.

           And what the United States had brought

 was a claim for interference; that is, this

 Court said that there were obligations that

 arose under the Compact and that it was -- it

 had a claim to be free from interference with

 those duties and obligations. 

The consent decree doesn't address 

that interference claim.  All it does is say --

is define what the equitable apportionment is as 

between Texas and New Mexico.  And the United 

States is free to bring -- as the Special Master 

indicated in -- in his -- in his third report, 

they're free to bring all of those claims of 

interference in other fora.  And that would be 

consistent with the way this Court has handled 

other cases.

really arguing about is, how does New Mexico

 satisfy its obligations?  That is, which 

specific water users within New Mexico must shut 

down wells, how New Mexico should be 

administering water, and those sorts of 

intrastate issues that this Court has held are 

-- are purely intramural disputes between

 competing water users within the state. 

And in other cases where there are 

those sorts of competing uses for -- between 

interstate users, the Court has sent the case 

back to those -- to the states. So, for 

example, in the case of United States versus 

Nevada, once the interstate matter was resolved 

as between California and Nevada, the case was 

-- this Court said, well, the remaining claims 

can be resolved within the State of Nevada 

because it only has to do with competing 

interests of New Mexico -- of Nevada water 

users. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you -- you 

would send the United States to, presumably, a 

federal court in New Mexico to sort out the 

concerns they have and would prefer to raise 

here?

MR. WECHSLER:  That's correct, Your

 Honor. For any reclamation claims, those would

 be in federal district court in New Mexico.  As

 to the reclamation -- the definition of Project 

rights, that's a New Mexico state adjudication

 court matter pursuant to the McCarran Act

 amendment and the Reclamation Act that Justice 

Gorsuch referred to earlier.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And is it 

possible that the New Mexico courts would issue 

decisions concerning the allocation of water 

that would be contrary to the consent decree? 

MR. WECHSLER:  No. We think the 

consent decree only resolves the issue of the 

interstate apportionment.  And -- and to Justice 

Jackson's question earlier, the remaining 

questions about depletions within the State of 

New Mexico, how New Mexico water users could be 

done, for example, protection of the treaty, all 

of those claims would be available to the United 

States, as the Special Master indicated, in the 

lower fora.

 correct?

 MR. WECHSLER:  No, I don't think

 that's right, Justice Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's what

 your co-counsel said.

 MR. WECHSLER:  Well, I -- I -- I don't

 think that's -- that's not how I understood my 

co-counsel.  What -- what is -- what is -- has a 

preclusive effect is the apportionment itself. 

So the baseline would apply as to the amount of 

water that Texas is entitled to receive. 

What it doesn't preclude the United 

States from arguing, which is really their --

their argument here, is how should the project 

operate?  How can the project be free from 

interference from New Mexico water users?  And 

that really is a question of how does New Mexico 

use its share of the apportionment. 

And that question they could raise --

they could -- they actually could seek to limit 

depletions all the way back to their priority 

date, which is, I believe, a 1903 priority date. 

And so they would have the ability to protect

 So the only thing really here is

 being resolved is the equitable apportionment as

 between the two states.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why aren't these

 all connected?  I mean, you -- you seem to be 

drawing a line between arguments that the United 

States can make related to internal use of the 

water by New Mexico but not the apportionment as 

between states. 

And maybe I'm confused, but I thought 

the -- this is one water system that works its 

way all the way down.  And so, to the extent 

that New Mexico is taking too much internally to 

New Mexico or not allowing it to continue on to 

the dam, doesn't that affect ultimately the 

Project, et cetera?  I mean, how can you 

separate these two out in the way that you are? 

MR. WECHSLER:  Well, I think it's just 

a matter of understanding what the hierarchy 

here is. So, as the Special Master indicated in 

cases like Hinderlider, California versus United

the two states is established by the Compact

 And once that apportionment is set, 

now the Project must operate within that 

apportionment. And so the amounts that the 

districts are entitled to, for example, the New

 Mexico District, that amount, to use the

 language from Nebraska versus Wyoming, can rise 

no higher than New Mexico's apportionment

 itself. 

And so, to the extent that the -- the 

Project -- or the United States has a claim 

concerned about, like, are there New Mexico 

water users taking water, that is purely an 

interstate matter.  It's a matter of how is the 

New Mexico apportionment being used. 

And that's a matter that this Court 

has held, and the Special Master also is 

recommending, that those questions can be 

resolved in the lower courts, courts that are 

more appropriate or -- or more used to 

addressing questions of having to do with New 

Mexico water administration, New Mexico water 

use, which New Mexico water users should be shut 

down, how to reduce depletions.

 43 percent of what's in Elephant Butte has to go 

to Texas using the D-2 baseline. That's the --

right, Justice Gorsuch.  And all the consent

consented to, and that is the Project must be 

operated in a manner that the equitable 

apportionment is delivered, that is, the 

43 percent that Texas is entitled to actually

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

MR. LIU: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  Just four quick points. 

First, I think I heard my friend from 

Texas acknowledge that the consent decree would 

be binding on the United States with respect to 

its claims in this case. I think that's just 

game over under -- under the Firefighters 

decision, which couldn't be clearer that a 

consent decree can't bind the -- can't 

distinguish -- extinguish the -- the claims of a

 Second, on the nature of the -- of the 

United States' claims, Justice Jackson, I think

 you're exactly right, the -- the -- the -- the 

-- my friends' attempt to kind of divide these 

claims into an intrastate portion or an 

interstate portion just doesn't make any sense

 given what this Court has already said about how

 this -- how this -- this water system works. 

The Project is intertwined with -- with the 

Compact. 

And -- and -- and we have been here 

all along protecting the Project's delivery of 

water to the districts and Mexico.  That 

delivery of water is the Compact's 

apportionment. So, insofar as we are trying to 

enforce the protection of that delivery of 

water, we are trying to enforce the Compact's 

apportionment as -- as it -- as it is specified. 

I think the clearest way to -- to 

appreciate this point that our claims are -- are 

the -- are the parallel to the Compact claims 

that have been in this case from the beginning 

is to just look at Texas's complaint.  On page 

16 of its complaint in this case, it asks for an

 injunction that would command New Mexico to stop

 interfering and impeding the authority of the 

Rio Grande Project. That's Exhibit A for why 

there's no way to -- to -- to untangle the --

the project's delivery of water from the

 Compact's apportionment.  They're both the same

 thing.

 My friend from New Mexico said, well, 

the United States will be free to argue about 

whether certain users of New Mexico are properly 

divvying up New Mexico's share under the consent 

decree. But our entire claim in this case is 

about the definition of the share itself.  It's 

not about how people in New Mexico should divide 

up the eventual share.  It's about the delivery 

of water to the two irrigation districts and 

Mexico -- Mexico, and -- and it's not about the 

-- the interstate issue. 

Third, on the -- on the obligations, 

my friend from Texas wanted to characterize the 

obligations that this consent decree would 

impose as minor obligations.  As an initial 

matter, under Firefighters, that just doesn't 

matter.  I mean, this is just Contracts 101. 

Two people cannot contract together and impose

any obligations on a non-consenting third party.

 There's no exception to that rule in

 this Court's original jurisdiction docket.  In

 fact, I would have thought that its -- in this

 scenario, that that -- that rule is most

 important because the United States is not 

standing here before you as an ordinary

 litigant.  We are the federal sovereign. 

And so, in addition to the rule in 

Firefighters, there are rules about sovereign 

immunity, sovereign immunity, intergovernment 

immunity.  All these rules protect the federal 

government from being what is an essential --

essentially a direct regulation by the states. 

And the last point I'll make is -- is 

about this -- this idea that the states can just 

come together and resolve ambiguities in --

ambiguities in the Compact and then impose them 

on the United States.  This just conflates the 

consent decree with the Compact. 

The -- the -- the whole point of 

Firefighters was that states by their mere 

consent cannot impose on non-consenting parties 

their view of the law. Rather, that view of the 

law has to be litigated on the merits by the
