 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 23A349, Ohio 

versus the Environmental Protection Agency, and

 the consolidated cases.

 Ms. Sridharan.

          ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATHURA J. SRIDHARAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE STATE APPLICANTS 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The EPA set out to address the 

contributions of 23 upwind states to downwind 

air pollution through a single federal plan, 

but, as commenters predicted and before the plan 

became final, the legal predicates for the 

federal plan, that is, the state plan 

disapprovals, came under fire in courts all 

around the country. 

The specter of lesser participation in 

the federal plan revealed yet another problem. 

The EPA's choice of method, that is, selecting a 

single cost threshold and applying it uniformly 

across all 23 states to establish emissions 

limits, has consequences; namely, the math

doesn't work when the inputs don't match the

 outputs.

 With the SIP disapprovals in flux and

 the EPA's methodology requiring full 

participation, the EPA had an obligation to

 consider what happens to the federal plan when 

one or more states drop out, that is, when the 

inputs, 23 states, don't match the outputs, now

 the 11 states that remain in the plan. 

Its failure has become consequential. 

The plan now regulates under half of the states 

and a quarter of the emissions that the EPA 

originally set out to regulate.  Under this 

fractured plan and without a stay, the remaining 

states and their industries face serious harm. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, it seems that 

your argument is dependent on whether or not the 

original plan was interdependent and required 

all the states to be in. 

What's your best evidence for that? 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  The best evidence for 

that, Your Honor, is the method that the EPA 

chose, and the method it chose has to do with 

discerning points of diminishing marginal

returns, which means that when the mix of states 

changes, in this case, when states drop out and

 their particular technologies and industries

 drop out with them, those points of diminishing

 marginal returns shift, and they shift somewhat 

unpredictably, which means that the relevant 

cost threshold for a different mix of states

 could be cheaper, and, with full candor to the 

Court, it could be the same or even be more 

expensive. 

The problem is we don't know. It is 

the unpredictability that renders this plan 

unreasonable as to any different mix of states. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you break 

that down?  I don't understand.  You started 

your introduction by saying that the commonality 

was cost.  But I thought that cost had to do 

with the technology and how much it costs to 

implement, so I don't see why that would be 

different among the 50 states or marginally 

important enough to be different. 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  Of course, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And to the extent 

that the other states dropping out don't

 increase the cost for any of the remaining

 states, they -- their allotment remains the same

 regardless of how many people are participating. 

So I don't see how you're raising an argument, 

frankly, not for yourself because nothing's

 changed.

 MS. SRIDHARAN:  Well, Your Honor, let 

me take that in reverse, and I'm happy to go 

down the gritty path of the technical details. 

But, before that, the allotments may not change 

in the way the EPA has executed the plan, but 

the allotments themselves are wrong when the EPA 

fails to consider what happens with lesser 

participation. 

And answering --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- I -- say 

it, but show me. 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  Sure, Your Honor.  The 

answer goes, again, to the methodology, which I 

keep calling the point of diminishing marginal 

returns question, and I'm happy to go step by 

step into what is admittedly an extremely gritty 

mathematical problem. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why don't you get 

to the end question. Nothing is changing in

 states that are -- involved -- who -- for whom

 stay -- stays have not been given, their

 allotment doesn't change, nothing changes.

 MS. SRIDHARAN:  Again, Your Honor, 

you're talking about the execution of those 

allocations, but the allocations themselves are 

now wrong, and what I mean by that is the EPA's

 method of selecting a single cost threshold. 

Now that goes to looking for points on 

a graph where an additional dollar spent 

produces little to no additional emissions 

reductions.  Those points on that graph change 

unpredictably, erratically, when the mix of 

states changes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I 

-- I understand that point, but the 

calculations, the methodology is all there, and 

I assume you just -- instead of putting 23 

states in, you put 11 in and -- and, in looking 

for whatever reduction, instead of a hundred, 

you do the 11 percent. 

How long do you think it would take if 

there were a proceeding to adjust the numbers 

along the lines that you propose or at least for

MS. SRIDHARAN:  I'm sure they could, 

Your Honor, but here is the problem:  They 

failed to consider any of that.  I mean, this is 

a failure to consider problem.  They failed to 

consider the most important aspect of the 

interdependency that they introduced into the 

program by virtue of using this particular 

methodology. 

What's more is, even if there 

ultimately is no change -- and I can't tell you 

what that looks like, whether there is a 

difference in the obligations or not -- there 

are at least some examples in the record for the 

coalition of states that I represent where there 

could be a cheaper cost threshold.

go ahead and execute your obligations as they

 are.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  To make sure I 

understand that, I think you're saying, but

 correct me if I'm wrong, that when the EPA said 

the whole thing is severable in response to the 

comments that the SIP disapprovals were going to 

be problematic and that would unravel the whole 

plan, when the EPA said, oh, don't worry about 

it, it'll be severable, that that was not 

adequately explained in terms of how the subset 

of states would work. 

Is that what you're saying? 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  That is definitely 

correct as to our position with respect to the 

severability provision.  That is not just a 

failure to explain; it just blows past the 

problem.  It is, at best, boilerplate. 

And let me give you an example of why 

that's true.  Had they had --

have changed?

capacious terms that the EPA uses in its final

find a whole lot of commonality.

 MS. SRIDHARAN:  Well, Your Honor, that 

brings me to the second reason I'm here

 discussing sort of the nitty-gritty of that 

methodology, and that is to directly answer this 

Court's order and the question of why lesser

 participation matters, and in order to do that, 

we have had to plumb the record well past what 

is in the final rule deep into the technical 

support documents that the EPA provided. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I appreciate that.  I 

mean, we gave you a question and you're trying 

to answer the question. 

I -- I -- I guess it does, though, 

suggest to me that this is an unusual posture 

for us to be in. No court has looked at the 

kinds of questions that you're raising here and 

the kinds of questions that we asked you to 

discuss.  Not a single court has addressed that 

issue. 

And yet here we are on papers that 

also do not address the issue trying to figure 

that out.  That -- that seems quite odd to me,

 that.

 MS. SRIDHARAN:  Well, two reasons or 

two answers to that, Your Honor.

 First of all, while these proceedings 

are going on, the states and their industries

 continue to suffer irreparable harm.  And, 

second, perhaps this would be a different story 

had the EPA refuted anything with respect to the 

interdependencies in the plan. 

They have not said a single word 

saying that the interdependencies do not exist. 

I will -- I will concede that they keep saying, 

well, you can just plow ahead with your 

obligations.  But they don't explain why those 

obligations make sense any more under the 

methodology that they chose. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Counsel, did you 

raise this interdependence point in the 

comments? 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

Commenters did preview the fact that the federal 

plan and its uniformity would be destroyed by 

the SIP disapprovals and the litigation 

surrounding that.  I can point to --

Act itself, it ties publication in the Federal 

Register to final agency action that is 

reviewable under the Clean Air Act's judicial

 review provisions.

 Second, by the EPA's own words in the 

prepublication notice it presented in March, the

 EPA noted that that would not be the final rule 

for the purpose of compliance, and, in fact, 

that would fail the second prong of this Court's 

Bennett test because legal consequences did not 

flow from that. 

But I also want to take a step back 

because, even if this Court disagrees with me as 

to whether the stays fall into or out of the 

gambit of what the agency had to consider, the 

fact that the commenters previewed all of the 

problems with respect to the SIP disapprovals 

and cautioned that the federal plan's uniformity 

would -- would falter, and then very quickly 

afterwards there was confirmation of that 

through litigation that popped up all around the 

country before the rule even -- the federal plan 

was in a prepublication form. 

All of that cued the agency into its 

obligation to address this very serious

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I'm done.

 JUSTICE JACKSON: So we're here on

MS. SRIDHARAN:  That's right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- it's fairly

Circuit, and, in fact, my understanding is that 

you haven't even briefed this argument yet in 

the D.C. Circuit.  So I'm trying to understand 

what the emergency is that warrants Supreme 

Court intervention at this point. 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  At the breakneck speed 

we're going, in order to go -- get into 

compliance with an unlawful federal rule, we are 

spending immense sums, both the states as well 

as our industries.  And on top of that, we are 

facing the threat of power shortages and heating

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes, but everybody 

who has to comply with the rule, right, has to

 spend some -- something, I would think, in order

 to do so. And what I'm a little concerned about 

is that really your argument is just boiling 

down to we think we have a meritorious claim and 

we don't want to have to follow the law while 

we're challenging it. 

And I don't understand why every 

single person who is challenging a rule doesn't 

have that same set of circumstances. 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  I think that goes to 

the immense sums that are spent that are not 

recoupable.  It goes to the fact that the 

timeline is exceedingly compressed, so the 

heating shortages we speak of, and if you go to 

Grubb Declaration that the natural gas pipelines 

have submitted, paragraphs 66 and 67, the harms 

we're talking about are serious in terms of

quickly.  It is also not an incomplete record 

with respect to the methodology itself. 

Now that methodology, again, goes well 

deep into the technical support documents, in 

part because the EPA engaged in a sort of 

capacious way of talking about the methodology, 

but it's there.  And the ozone transport policy 

analysis goes down the details of how the cost 

threshold is specific to the mix of states that 

goes into it. 

And when that shifts, the EPA has an 

obligation to assess why it matters or why that 

cost threshold is still reasonably applied to 

any remaining states.  It has not done so. This 

is -- the burden is on the EPA to consider the 

inflexibilities that it introduced into the

And one of the reasons usually we 

don't take cert on a case is if it has a lot of 

stuff before you get to the merits issues, which 

is the only thing that we would be concerned

for reconsideration.

of the SIP disapprovals themselves because, if

 the SIP disapprovals were valid, you wouldn't 

have a leg to stand on here. So how are we

 supposed to know that in this posture? 

So I guess what I'm saying is there 

are so many hoops that you have to go through 

and you have to go through all of them. You 

have to run the table before we could even begin

 to get to your merits question.  Isn't that, 

according to our usual standards, a reason to 

deny this application? 

MS. SRIDHARAN:  Justice Kagan, you've 

given a lot of stuff associated with this case, 

but there's one thing I really want to talk 

about, which is what happens if the SIP 

disapprovals ultimately settle in a place where 

all 23 states end up staying in the plan. That 

doesn't change our argument. 

The problem is the EPA failed to 

consider in the first instance what happens when 

there is lesser participation.  This is 

something that it doesn't matter what's going to 

happen next. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that -- that's 

sort of interesting.  That doesn't seem

 intuitive to me.  I mean, if all these lawsuits 

that the states are bringing are going to end up

 losing, I mean, the idea that you can be here 

and be demanding emergency relief just because 

states have kicked up a lot of dust seems not

 the right answer to me.

 MS. SRIDHARAN: No, that's not right, 

Your Honor, because, in this very unusual 

circumstance under this statute, as well as the 

EPA's choice of method, it is relevant to look 

back at what Your Honor has just termed "kicking 

up dust." 

But it's not kicking up dust because, 

first of all, the legal flaws were quite 

obvious, and they were previewed by commenters, 

and then very shortly afterwards litigation and 

then the stays came around, all of which the EPA 

had an obligation to engage in rulemaking with 

its eyes wide open. 

Now, why that matters, I gave you two 

reasons:  the unique statutory circumstance, as 

well as the EPA's choice of method. The statute 

itself requires the EPA to look back to prior 

predicate rulemaking in order to assert its 

authority to have a federal plan, and

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you think the 

EPA should have done? I mean, there are 23

 MS. SRIDHARAN:  Mm-hmm.

 very far from talking about the line-drawing

 What the EPA had to do was consider

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE E. STETSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE INDUSTRY APPLICANTS 

MS. STETSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

EPA's authority under the Good 

Neighbor provision is limited to regulating a 

state's emissions that contribute significantly 

to downwind non-attainment.  If EPA is 

regulating beyond that authority, it is 

regulating beyond the statute. 

Ms. Sridharan has explained the 

deficiencies in a broken rule in which 

90 percent of power plant emissions, 75 percent 

of total emissions, have been taken out of the 

plan. But the Court also asked whether the 

emissions controls in the rule are reasonable

regardless of the number of states that are

 involved.  The answer is no for three primary

 reasons.

 First, the rule selectively ignores

 EME Homer's cost-effectiveness framework. 

Second, the rule over-controls across a number 

of industries. And, third, the rule imposes an 

impossible compliance timeline that will result

 in reliability issues across the country. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think one of the 

concerns we have is that so much of this seems 

to depend on the interdependence of the 23 

states and what happens if some of the states 

are excluded. 

So let me ask it in a different way. 

Could EPA have accomplished the exact same thing 

by regulating the states individually as opposed 

to in a -- as an interdependent group? 

MS. STETSON: It could not have 

accomplished the exact same thing, Justice 

Thomas, to the extent that it would have to 

show, when you say "exact same thing," that the 

outcome, the cost threshold and so forth, would 

be the same across 11 states.

But, to your question of Ms. 

Sridharan, I think the issue that you were 

looking for is evidence about what EPA did, and

 I want to point you to 88 Federal Register

 36741. Excuse me.  "When the effects of" -- I'm

 quoting.  "When the effects of these emissions 

reductions are assessed collectively across the

 hundreds of EGU and non-EGU industrial sources 

that are subject to this rule, the cumulative 

improvements in ozone levels at downwind 

receptors, while they may vary to some extent, 

are both measurable and meaningful."  That is 

the best example of the collective question that 

EPA asked itself and answered. 

Now, you know, Justice Sotomayor, you 

asked the question about cost and whether the 

obligations, for example, on Ohio would be the 

same. But I think the question here is -- goes 

back to what this Court approved in EME Homer. 

It's not just a question about whether EPA can 

regulate something that is inexpensive, 

potentially inexpensive.  It's not a question 

about whether EPA can regulate emissions.  It's 

a question about whether EPA has appropriately 

calculated what it calls that knee-in-the-curve,

the point where the emissions contribution to a 

downwind state is controlled at a reasonable

 cost level.

 So I think the exchange that you had 

with Ms. Sridharan about where that cost issue

 comes from has to do with the question about, if 

you've got 23 states and all of their EGUs and 

all of the non-EGU sources that are linked into

 this rule all feeding into that cost question, 

what happens if you take out the states where 

maybe you can control those costs most cheaply 

and you're left with states that actually have 

much higher cost thresholds to impose on 

industries or on EGUs? That changes the cost 

calculus. 

It also changes, of course, the 

emissions calculus.  And I want to point in 

particular --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is -- is that in your 

brief? 

MS. STETSON: Yes, it is. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Where -- where --

where is that? 

MS. STETSON: When -- when we discuss 

the 23-state question. You can look at pages 11

to 13 of the Kinder Morgan brief. You can look 

at pages 18 to 20 and 4 to 9 of the reply.  And

 all of those go to this question about that

 difference between 23 and 11.

 But I want to bring home the point

 with a -- a couple quotes from the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess -- I guess my 

reaction is a little bit the same as -- that I 

-- I -- I -- I gave to Ms. Sridharan, is, I 

mean, this is at such a higher level of 

generality than you're making the same argument 

now. You -- you know, our briefs do not really 

address this very complicated cost argument. 

MS. STETSON: I think, Justice Kagan, 

the -- the cost argument, while -- while some of 

the metrics, I think, are complicated, things 

like ozone modeling and so forth, the -- the 

bottom line is actually not that complicated. 

The bottom line is what EPA was 

supposed to do under the Good Neighbor provision 

was to figure out, as it said in EME Homer and 

as it said it was doing here, where is that cost 

threshold.  That word, "cost threshold," if you 

go back and look at the rule in EME Homer, 

appears 185 times.

But what the Court did -- what -- what

 the EPA did here with respect to non-EGUs in

 particular is to look at the question about 

average costs, which is a completely different

 issue. Average cost is just how much do these

 emissions control cost?  Does that seem like a

 reasonable number?  Okay, we'll apply them and 

see what emissions controls exist downwind.

 And I'll tell you the other thing 

important to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I mean, the only 

point I was making -- and I don't want to push 

you too hard on this because it's not your fault 

this is coming in a weird posture.  I -- I don't 

even seem the term "cost threshold" on these 

pages. 

MS. STETSON: I think the term "cost 

threshold" is -- is in the EPA's brief.  It's a 

fundamental question about the way that EME 

Homer exists.  If you look at the Kinder Morgan 

brief, there's a separate discussion of costs 

that I think is particularly relevant to this. 

There are two different strands, I 

think, that we're chasing here. One of them has 

to do with the 23 versus 11 question, what

 happens when you take 12 states out.  The other 

question has to do with how EPA went about 

calculating costs. And I think I was moving

 from that first question to the second.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On -- on that

 first question, this discussion that you're

 having now, I thought the broader point was EPA 

was told the SIP disapprovals were going -- were

 problematic and were going to be problematic and 

could be unlawful. 

And EPA responded, you know, no, 

they're not, but even if they are, we don't 

care, it's severable.  That's a fine response if 

they then go on and explain why it still works 

if it's severable, but that's goose egg.  They 

don't have an explanation there. 

MS. STETSON: It -- it is a goose egg. 

Page 36693 of the Federal Register contains the 

entirety of -- of what we'll call reasoning. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So all this 

discussion about the cost threshold where --

that's what they should have explained if 

they're going to make the point, which is a big 

one, hey, even if 12 states drop out, who cares, 

because it still works.

Okay. Show us how -- to Justice

 Sotomayor's question, show us how it works.  But

 that's -- that's their burden, I think, to

 show -- to justify -- to not be arbitrary and

 capricious.

 MS. STETSON: Yes.  And, in fact, if 

you look at that page that I just cited, 36693,

 what you'll see is it says, "Should any

 jurisdiction-specific aspect of this rule be 

found invalid, the EPA views the rule as 

severable..."  "Should any industry-specific 

rule be found invalid, the EPA --" rolls this 

rule -- "views this rule as severable." 

This is not intended to be an 

exhaustive list. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, whose 

burden -- that may be their burden below. But 

the burden here as I understand it is on you to 

show this. 

And we go back to what Justice Kagan 

said. I read the -- I read these applications 

pretty carefully, and I didn't understand this 

cost argument at all. And I'm really 

simplistic.  I don't have a math degree, all 

right? If you're sharing costs among 23 people,

your cost is going to be less.  If you're 

sharing costs among 11 people, your cost is

 going to be more.

 So, since this plan doesn't change any

 allocations depending on the number of people 

who are in it, states are bound by the number

 that was calculated on the larger group, how are

 the remaining states affected by the fact that 

their cost should have been higher, but it's not 

because it's been fixed at this lower number? 

MS. STETSON: Justice Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm very 

simplistic.  You know, cost divided by 23 is 

always less than cost divided by 11 if your cost 

is going to stay constant. 

MS. STETSON: That's the question, 

though.  And -- and I think, Justice Sotomayor, 

the answer --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But does it 

matter?  Meaning, if you're paying less on the 

wrong number because it was divided by 23, how 

could it be that on 11 your cost is ever going 

to be greater than that number, than the 23 --

that would be in or out of that cost calculus.

 So let's suppose just for -- to take your

 example, let's -- let's suppose --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  My point is, 

once the states drop out, it doesn't matter what 

your responsibility is because the cost is going

 to remain the same given the nature of this 

plan. They're not changing the cost once 

they've calculated the responsibility of the 23. 

MS. STETSON: Justice Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If 12 are not 

paying it, what does it matter to you? 

MS. STETSON: -- I think that is the 

bug and not the feature of this plan.  The --

the cost was calculated where it was because EPA 

looked at the aggregate costs of controls over 

that -- that Federal Register cite that I read 

you, hundreds of EGUs across all of the states, 

hundreds of industries' units across all of the 

states.  It figured out what that aggregate cost 

was and then it decided to allocate obligations. 

So we keep talking about the end of 

that process, what -- what obligations would 

change on a state based on taking some states 

out.

 look. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It seems to me 

that if the aggregate is contributing to

 something and there's a certain amount of people 

who for whatever legal reason have been taken 

out of the calculus, why should you pay for them 

or not pay for them if the problem is a national 

one really, not an individual one? 

MS. STETSON: I think, Justice 

Sotomayor, that that's actually EPA's argument, 

is that, you know, it -- it makes sense to 

impose these emissions controls across these 

industries because it will result in what EPA 

calls meaningful reductions. 

Now I'd encourage you to look at page 

36743 and 36747 to figure out exactly the scope 

of those meaningful reductions of the 88 Federal 

Register final rule.  What we're talking about 

when it comes to meaningful reductions is on the 

order of a total of .66 parts per billion 

averaged across all of these receptors.

Now there's a bigger number involved. 

That number is, if you add all of the reductions 

from the receptors from Arizona to Connecticut 

and you add them up, then you get a bigger parts 

per billion number, but that's like ticketing me 

for speeding if I exceed the speed limit one 

mile per hour in 23 different states.  But --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Ms. --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Ms. Stetson -- oh, 

I'm sorry. I wanted to talk about a different 

kind of cost.  I just want to talk about the 

costs that you have incurred thus far because 

the rule has been in effect, right, and part of 

your argument for emergency relief is the 

crushing costs and the risk of, you know, energy 

disruption, et cetera. 

What has been happening so far? 

MS. STETSON: Justice Barrett, the 

industries that I represent have been incurring 

costs to try to start permitting, compliance, 

all -- all sorts of issues involving the run-up 

to installation of these controls. 

But let me pause on this because I 

think it also responds to a question, Justice

presumably, I mean, the rule's been in effect

costs they have to incur in the next 12 to 18

 months in order to stay in compliance with this

 timeline that we have pointed out is completely

 unreliable, in -- in addition to all of the

 other problems that we've talked about.

 But, on the question of irreparable 

harm in another respect, you know, what we are 

talking about is also the question of immediate 

reliability issues, and if you look at the Brown 

Declaration attached to the American Forest & 

Paper stay application, you'll find that in the 

summer of 2024, he anticipates significant 

reliability problems because of some immediate 

changes that need to be made to a particular

of that particular system.  So the harms --

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, I have a

 question.  Why haven't you asked the D.C.

 Circuit to expedite their review?  I mean, if 

you're suffering the harms that you're talking 

about and you're pending before that court, I 

guess I'm still confused as to why we are the 

ones who are being asked in the first instance 

to look at this. 

MS. STETSON: Justice Jackson, we --

we did move for expedited briefing.  We were not 

given the briefing schedule that we wished. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  I thought you moved 

for a delay in briefing until after this Court 

had decided. 

MS. STETSON: We initially sought 

expedited briefing.  We did not get the schedule 

we wished. After the Court granted argument in 

late December, we asked for a delay in order to 

impose some order on the process between this 

Court and that court.

burden in this situation.  I mean, surely, the

 Supreme Court's emergency docket is not a viable

 alternative for every party that believes they 

have a meritorious claim against the government 

and doesn't want to have to comply with a rule

 while they're challenging it.

 It seems to me that even just sort of 

irreparable harm, as we've defined it, is

 insufficient to have the Supreme Court ask --

acting as a first decider on the merits of an 

issue that hasn't been addressed by the lower 

court. So can you help me to understand what 

the burden should be in this very unique 

situation? 

MS. STETSON: The burden should be 

exactly what this Court described in Nken versus 

Holder, Justice Jackson. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But, in Nken versus 

Holder, was that a situation in which the lower 

court had not yet even ruled at all on the 

merits of the claim? 

MS. STETSON: It was a situation in 

which the order of an agency came up to this 

Court in a -- in a posture of a stay motion. 

Or, actually, I think, that court involved the

in which you have filed a claim in a lower

 court, you're -- the D.C. Circuit has not even 

looked at it, and you're asking the Supreme 

Court to essentially give a preview of its view 

of the merits. 

And I think that's quite 

extraordinary, and I'm trying to understand 

whether the same burden should apply on an 

applicant in that situation and one in which we 

at least have a lower court ruling that you 

could show us and say: These people have made a 

mistake.  We don't have that here. 

MS. STETSON: Justice Jackson, what we 

have is an agency order in which we are saying 

this agency made a significant mistake, in fact, 

several of them that are fault lines throughout 

the agency order. That is exactly what was at 

issue in Nken.

what the Court says there is -- and -- and a

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 I'd like to make three quick points at

 the outset.  First, with respect to the 

interests of the state applicants, I think it's 

important to bear in mind that at this stage of 

the proceedings, there are a lot more states on 

our side than there are on theirs, and it's

 vital to bear in mind the equities of the 

downwind states because that's the whole point 

of the Good Neighbor provision of the Clean Air 

Act and the Good Neighbor Plan that the EPA 

implemented.  And when we think about the 

interests of the downwind states, it's natural 

to think first of their humanitarian interest in 

the health and well-being of their residents. 

But the downwind states that are out of 

attainment also have a legal obligation to come 

into attainment by deadlines specified by the 

statute. 

And to stay the rule in its entirety 

based on some theoretical possibility that the 

contours of an 11-state rule might have been 

somewhat different if EPA had anticipated all 

the stays would be terribly unfair to the 

downwind states.

The second point is that in addition

 to the severability language that Justice

 Kavanaugh referred to, EPA in the preamble said 

that it was reserving judgment on whether

 several additional states should ultimately be

 included in the plan.  It said that if any of 

the 23 states that were currently included 

devised compliant SIPs, they could be taken out 

of the federal plan. 

And so EPA anticipated from the outset 

that the plan was one whose geographic 

composition could change.  And EPA devised the 

requirements for each state in order that they 

would be workable if a smaller or a larger set 

of states were ultimately covered. 

And then the last thing I would say is 

it's true that the federal plan is not currently 

providing the air quality benefits that EPA had 

hoped because the stays of the SIP plan 

disapprovals mean it's only reducing emissions 

from 11 states rather than 23. But, for those 

11 states, the requirements that are imposed on 

sources are exactly the same as would have been 

imposed on sources in those 11 states if the 

full plan had been implemented.

And the -- the applicants have

 suggested that it's -- it's possible that the 

benefits associated with those requirements

 might have been different if EPA had known that

 only 11 states would have been included.  But 

there's no reason to think that that's so. As 

-- as we look at it, the difference between

 three and zero is the same as the difference 

between 10 and seven. 

If you think that the plan is only 

delivering 30 percent of the -- the -- the 11 

states are only delivering 30 percent of the 

benefits, they're still delivering that -- that 

same quantum of air quality benefit. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Stewart, was 

there any weight put on the interdependence of 

the 23 states as far as the benefits of the plan 

and the cost to the individual states? 

MR. STEWART: I -- I think, when they 

refer to interdependence, they're -- they're 

referring to kind of three topics that were 

discussed in the preamble.  The first was EPA

sources, in the end, it was placing the same 

requirements on all of the covered states; that 

is, to do equity, it was saying that power 

plants in Indiana need to come up to the same 

standard as power plants in Texas.

 And so, in that sense, the plan was 

interdependent in that EPA wanted the same 

restrictions to apply to sources in all states,

Circuit, and that could result in Utah and 

Oklahoma being put back into the federal plan.

 So part of the reason it wouldn't make

 sense for EPA to do a sort of ground-up inquiry 

is that, just as it was getting done with that,

 it might have a new geographic composition to

 deal with.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But it could 

have -- in response to the comments that said 

the SIP disapprovals were going to be 

problematic, EPA could have come back and said: 

Well, if some of the states are knocked out, the 

requirements will still be the same even if 

there are only 15 states or even if there are 

only 10 states because and kind of explained 

that reasoning. 

That is, as I understand it, absent. 

And the problem is we're not sure if the 

requirements would be the same with 11 states as 

with 23.  And the -- and it's just not 

explained.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The plan will 

become unworkable. The cost, the -- the 

requirements might change.  And when EPA comes 

back, it doesn't explain anything on that. 

MR. STEWART: I mean, we -- we know 

that the -- the requirements don't change.  That 

is, EPA imposed equivalent requirements on 

different -- on power plants, on steel industry 

sources, on pipeline engines, with respect to 

industrial facilities in -- in the same source 

category that are located in different states. 

EPA imposed -- imposed exactly the same 

requirements. 

And the requirements that are imposed 

on sources in Indiana and Ohio -- West Virginia 

is out for now because they got a stay -- but, 

in Indiana and in Ohio, they're exactly the same 

as they would have been under an 11-state plan.

 MR. STEWART: Yes, that's right.

 And -- and, certainly, what we have now is a --

a closer approximation to what an 11-state would

 have -- plan would have looked like than zero

 is. And what the applicants are asking for is 

zero, and that isn't an option that EPA could 

have chosen as a matter of statute. EPA was

 obligated as a matter of statute to promulgate 

some plan for each of the states that it found

It's not conclusive.

circumstances where provisions are -- are 

interrelated and so that the presumption is 

overcome.  And why wouldn't that be true here?

D.C. Circuit kind of as I understand it has two

 prongs.  The first is did the agency intend the 

rule to be severable along particular lines, 

and, second, if the agency intended it, can what

 remains function -- sensibly as its own rule. 

And, here, we know that EPA intended it to be

 severable.

 The -- the other thing I would say

 about the -- the possible rarity of express 

severability provisions is it's been a recurrent 

feature of these plans that plans -- states 

would drop in and out, EPA might promulgate a 

revised Good Neighbor Plan and some of the 

states would be included in the revised plan and 

some would stay in the original plan. 

So it was just understood as a feature 

of this type of rulemaking that when the 

composition of the plan changed, the 

requirements imposed on the remaining states 

would not change. 

EPA decided in this rulemaking to make 

that statement explicit, to say EPA regarded it 

as severable along geographic lines.  And that 

at least pretermitted inquiry -- any inquiry as 

what -- as to what EPA intended the rule to be,

           JUSTICE JACKSON: So, Mr. Stewart, can

 I ask you just about their challenge?  And I'm 

trying to understand it because the rule was 

enacted originally with 23 states. And was

 there a challenge at that point about the number

 of states originally, when it first was enacted? 

MR. STEWART: I -- I -- I don't --

there -- there were challenges to the antecedent 

SIP disapprovals, and many of the states said we 

should not be under any "Good Neighbor Plan" 

because in -- or in -- under any new "Good 

Neighbor Plan" because we are already doing 

enough to ensure that our sources don't 

contribute significantly.  That --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So there was a 

possibility they could be out? 

MR. STEWART: There was a possibility 

and -- and those -- those comments and those 

challenges were really brought during the SIP 

disapproval process.  They were not brought as 

-- necessarily as challenges to the -- the 

federal plan.

developments like judicial stays and how we

 think about that in terms of the ground shifting 

and whether they can even -- it's even

 judicially cognizable in this way.

 MR. STEWART: Yes, you -- you would 

think that once the rule is promulgated, once 

it's signed and finalized by the agency, that if 

subsequent events provide -- somebody thinks 

provide good cause for EPA to reconsider what 

it's done, we think it's a requirement as a 

matter of justiciability that a petition for 

reconsideration or --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, because we --

we ordinarily would say, like, the agency can't 

supplement its reasons after the fact.  We look 

at the rule at the time it's enacted and we 

determine whether or not there were promulgation 

problems, right? 

MR. STEWART: Exactly. And we think, 

first, that's a solid basis for finding a claim 

to be nonjusticiable.  But, even if the Court

fact that it is a kind of based on subsequent

 events should inform your consideration of the 

merits. That is, it should be the burden of the 

applicants to say fairly precisely here is why 

the diminution of geographic coverage logically 

warrants a change to the terms of the plan --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Stewart, on --

MR. STEWART: Yes. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- that point, so as 

I understand it, EPA originally proposed a 

23-state solution, got some comments back saying 

it's not going to be 23 states, it might be 

something less than that. 

Came back with a severability 

provision that effectively says instead of a one 

-- a one 23-state solution, we're going to have 

23 solutions.  And nobody got an opportunity to 

comment on that. 

And so part of the problem, it seems 

to me -- what -- all these discussions about 

what does it mean when we have this applied to 

individual states, some subset of 23, is because 

nobody got a chance to comment on that. 

Now you might say it's a logical

say we have 23 plans as opposed to one plan. 

And all of these arguments, nobody had a chance

 to have comment on.  What -- what do you say to

 that?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I guess part of 

what I would say is what I referred to earlier

 as the -- the -- the historical or legal

 backdrop; that is, it had traditionally been the 

case that the geographic composition of these 

plans would change, some states would drop out, 

some states might be added.  It was understood 

that a state could always get out of a federal 

plan for -- by --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, I'm not -- I'm 

-- I'm going to push back on that just a little 

bit because, originally, it was a 23-state 

solution.  Then you got comments that said:  Ah, 

some are going to fall out.  And the response 

was a severability provision, as Justice 

Kavanaugh pointed out, without a whole lot of 

explanation, and nobody got a chance to comment. 

I mean, what -- what -- what do you 

say to that, just to the point of the APA is all

 aggregate of 23?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I think I would say

comments to the effect of, if some states drop

 out, the plan will become arbitrary and 

capricious or will need to be rethought as to 

the remaining states.

 wasn't.

 MR. STEWART: I think -- most of it I 

-- there were initial determinations about which 

states should be included, but with respect to 

the states that were included, the -- the 

requirements were -- were almost -- were mostly 

uniform; that is, in 2024 and 2025, the plan 

would only impose new requirements on power 

plants, electric-generating units, and for the 

most part, during those years, those 

requirements would simply be that the power 

plants operate their existing controls to the 

maximum extent.

 been any deadline for the EPA to rule on that?

 MR. STEWART: There -- there was one 

-- there were two motions raising this issue. 

One was a motion for reconsideration filed by 

U.S. Steel, which raised this issue and also 

raised a pretty complicated set of technical

 challenges specific to the steel industry.  And

 there was another filed by AFPA styled a motion 

to stay that also raised the 11 versus 12. 

There is no deadline.  There is a 

mechanism for arguing that EPA has unreasonably 

been -- has unreasonably delayed, but that 

hasn't been invoked. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could -- the other 

question has to do with the fact that this is an 

emergency application.  We now receive many 

applications for stays.  Sometimes your office 

seeks a stay.  Sometimes your office opposes a 

stay. 

What is your office's position on the 

question whether in this context what the stay 

applicant must show is some sort of 

super-irreparable harm? Is the applicant 

required simply to show irreparable harm, or is

 threshold?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I -- I don't think 

that there is any requirement that it clear a

 higher threshold, but I think in balance -- just 

showing irreparable harm is -- is not enough,

 particularly if there are countervailing harms 

on the other side.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I -- I understand

MR. STEWART: And the -- the other 

point I'd make about the stay they are seeking

operate as a tolling principle. And by that, I 

mean if -- if the Court issued a stay tomorrow 

and then two years went by and we won in the 

D.C. Circuit and this Court denied cert and then 

the stay was vacated in February of 2026, the 

usual consequence of vacating a stay would be 

that regulated parties would thereafter be 

subject to all the same legal requirements as 

they would have been if no stay had ever been 

issued.  But that's not what they want. 

What they want, a rule is -- is a rule 

that says, if that happens, then all the

Justice Sotomayor? 

Justice Kagan? 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  I'm just 

wondering, Mr. Stewart, you know, how often this 

kind of thing comes up.  You know, there are a 

lot of NAAQSs, a lot of air pollutant standards, 

and, presumably, there's a kind of constant 

evaluation by the EPA of how to adjust those 

standards and then what SIPs are -- what SIPs 

need to change and if -- if a FIP is necessary. 

And this seems like a pretty regular part of the 

EPA's business and maybe a regular part of the

D.C. Circuit's business because that's true.

 And I'm -- I'm wondering if you would

 just say, is -- is -- is there something unusual

 about this case?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I mean, one of the 

ways in which this case is very different from 

EME Homer is that in EME Homer, you had the same 

pattern of EPA rejecting 20-some state plans and 

then implementing a federal plan, and there were 

a very wide array of challenges to the federal 

plan in EME Homer.  They went through the D.C. 

Circuit.  They got up to this Court. 

There -- there was very little 

litigation about the antecedent SIP 

disapprovals.  And so I think that that's one of 

the -- the unusual features of this case in 

comparison to prior cases involving Good 

Neighbor Plans. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So there hasn't been 

-- there -- there haven't been other 

circumstances in which this exact question has 

come up? 

MR. STEWART: Right.  I think, in the 

EME Homer context, there were three challenges 

to SIP disapprovals, and I don't know that any

 the merits.  And so there -- there wasn't this 

situation where preliminary orders entered in 

the SIP disapproval litigation caused people to 

argue about is the plan still rational as to the

 states that remain.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And do you know what 

the D.C. Circuit intends to do or what -- do you 

have a guess as to what the D.C. Circuit will do 

with respect to the interaction between the SIP 

litigations that are happening across the 

country and the question before it? 

MR. STEWART: I -- I don't have --

have a clear sense of what they will do, and I 

think it will depend in part on how does -- do 

the SIP litigation lawsuits progress while the 

D.C. Circuit is considering the case; that is, 

by the time that the D.C. Circuit is ultimately 

ready to issue a decision, we may have some or 

all of the SIP disapproval lawsuits resolved one 

way or the other, either in EPA's favor in which 

there are more states back in the plan, or if 

they're resolved against EPA, then the D.C. 

Circuit can kind of take it as given that those 

states are out for the time being and can

 Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  If -- if 11 states 

rather than 23 were involved, does that affect

 the trading program? 

MR. STEWART: It will affect it to the 

extent that there will be fewer trading --

potential trading partners.  We have a 

declaration from Mr. Goffman in -- in our 

appendix that says the trading program can still 

work robustly. It doesn't depend on the full 23 

states being involved.  We've certainly had 

plenty of trading programs in the past. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What does 

"robustly" mean? 

MR. STEWART: I don't know if he used 

the term "robustly," but I think what he meant 

is it -- it is still a kind of a -- a real and 

viable opportunity.  He said the price of 

allowances has not gone up.

thing I would say about the trading program is 

it would be absurd to think that if EPA had

 known there would only be an 11-state trading 

program, it wouldn't have regulated EGUs at all.

 Certainly, EPA would have regulated --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, I don't

 think -- yeah, I don't think that's the 

suggestion. But can I ask you a question about

 maybe following up on Justice Alito's questions 

and some of the more general questions that have 

been raised earlier about the standard, what 

we're doing here. 

On an emergency stay, one of the 

factors is irreparable harm.  I think both sides 

in my -- I'm just giving you my view -- both 

sides have irreparable harm, so that's a wash. 

The public interests, both sides have a strong 

public interest in my view. 

So then the only other factor on which 

we can decide this under our traditional 

standard is likelihood of success on the merits. 

In my view, that accounts for cert worthiness, 

but this is the kind of issue that would be cert 

worthy ultimately.  So check for me on that one. 

Then it comes down to likelihood of

looking at the merits, right?

 MR. STEWART: I -- I guess the two 

things I'd say in response --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Is that a -- a --

can I get a yes or no on that?

 MR. STEWART: Yeah.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can we -- can we

 determine likelihood of success on the merits 

without at least taking a look and making some 

assessment as best we can of the merits? 

MR. STEWART: I -- I agree with that. 

The -- the two things I would say are, first, in 

determining likelihood of ultimate success on 

the merits, the Court would not only have to --

to kind of reach its own judgment about is it 

arbitrary or not to have the current 11- versus 

12-state disparity, it would also have to make 

some predictive judgment about whether that 11-

versus 12-state disparity is going to continue 

into the future, and that would just require --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  That's --

do you think we make a better assessment after 

an oral argument than we do without an oral 

argument?

 MR. STEWART: And -- and -- and then 

the other thing I would say to your point about

 irreparable harm, I -- I think it is the case

 that both sides have shown some irreparable

 harm. I don't agree with the idea that if they

 both have shown irreparable harm, it's a wash,

 because I think particularly taking into account 

the equities of the downwind states --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I agree -- I agree 

with you about the equities of the downwind 

states, but there's also the equities of the 

upwind states and the industry, and I don't know 

how -- I mean, they're both like major.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And so we have to 

figure out what to do in the interim.  You said 

two years between now and 2026.  That's what we 

have to figure out. 

Should these costs be incurred for the 

next two years with the benefits to that -- the 

downwind states, or should these costs not be 

incurred with the detriments to the downwind 

states?  And the only way under our usual

standard to figure that out, as I see it, is to 

make the best evaluation we can -- and it's not

 easy, which is why we're here in my view -- of

 likelihood of success on the merits.

 MR. STEWART: And -- and I guess the 

only further point of -- or maybe it's a 

recapitulation of my point about likelihood of 

success is the applicants have offered 

speculation that the plan might have been 

different in some respects if it had been 

devised as an 11-state plan, but they haven't 

identified any concrete modification that they 

would --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, I think --

right. And this turns on -- okay, on the 

merits, they're arguing it's arbitrary and 

capricious.  And one of the classic arbitrary 

and capricious conclusions is a failure to 

explain.  It's not reasonable and reasonably 

explained. 

And one of the complaints they have, 

which we have to evaluate, is whether they're 

likely to succeed in saying that the rule as was 

not adequately explained in considering the 

possibility that the SIP disapprovals would be

might have been different if EPA had only had 11

 ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENTS 

MS. VALE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

In the Good Neighbor provision, 

Congress protected downwind states from 

pollution emitted in upwind states.  A stay of 

the Good Neighbor rule would undermine that 

statutory goal and the public interest by 

sending ozone pollution into downwind states,

that receive substantial pollution from the 

particular upwind states that are currently in 

the rule, including Ohio and Indiana.

 The harms from a stay will flow to

 both the residents of downwind states, who will 

experience health dangers, and to downwind

 industry, which pays increased costs to

 compensate for upwind pollution and comply with 

the current, more stringent standard. 

For example, Connecticut sources 

currently pay up to $13,000 per ton of ozone 

precursor reduced while, in the near term for 

power point -- plants under this rule, just to 

turn on controls costs about $1,600 per ton. By 

contrast, apply -- and that's why applying the 

rule to the upwind states is relatively less 

expensive and harmful. 

I welcome the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  How do you arrive at 

that conclusion that it's less expensive for the 

upwind states? 

MS. VALE: It comes from, I think, two 

things, one on either side of the balance.  For 

the upwind states, the rule is designed -- the 

way it -- it defines "significant contribution"

is for sources to do the relatively less

 expensive controls.

 I understand that there are still 

costs, but they are relatively less expensive 

because it's based on having upwind states do 

controls that downwind sources and many other 

sources across the country have already done,

 for example, like turning on pollution controls

 on power plants that are already installed. 

That's the lowest of the low-hanging fruit. 

By contrast, downwind sources, as they 

get the upwind pollution, they have to 

compensate for it, but they've already exhausted 

a lot of the less expensive strategies, so they 

need to turn to more and more expensive 

strategies to find any further cuts. 

And one of the reasons why sources 

have exhausted their less expensive options is 

because of the statutory consequences of 

non-attainment. So, in Section 7511, I believe 

(a), little (a), it is the Clean Air Act that 

puts on more and more stringent requirements 

onto downwind sources as states move into worse 

and worse levels of non-attainment.  So more and 

more sources need to put on controls, smaller

and smaller sources need to put on controls, and 

the controls themselves get more stringent.

 By -- and -- and -- and I think that 

that's how we get into this situation for the 

downwind sources. And the rule right now

 continues to provide substantial and meaningful

 benefits to the downwind sources.  It is not a

 shell or a disaster.  And that's because upwind 

pollution is not evenly distributed as it goes 

downwind.  So the downwind states that generally 

get a lot of pollution from the 11 states in the 

rule now still stand to get a lot of benefits. 

So, for example, in Wisconsin, the 

areas that struggle with air quality get 

approximately 40 percent of their ozone from the 

11 states currently in the rule, 13 percent from 

Indiana alone.  And for Connecticut, the current 

scope of the rule gets it 65 percent of the 

emission reductions compared to the full scope 

of the rule. 

And that relief for downwind states is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what --

what the -- they're -- they're asking for is

 simply an opportunity to make the argument 

before the agency. And as I understand it, the 

burden on the agency is simply to provide a 

rational or reasonable explanation.

 So you're making arguments on the 

merits.  We don't have those arguments made or 

substantiated on the record by the EPA. 

MS. VALE: Well, I think there -- the 

path that Congress laid out for raising these 

arguments when they arose after the end of the 

comment period is the petition for 

reconsideration.  A lot of the cost analysis 

that I'm giving you was considered by EPA. 

That's -- that's part of the rule. 

I mean, the -- part of the whole idea 

of the rule is that upwind states and upwind 

sources really, that each source -- each source 

needs to do its own significant contributions of 

pollution, needs to take care of its own, and 

that's defined by what each source can do using 

certain controls.  It's not defined based on

some magic number of emissions reductions from

 23 states.

 And I think we have every reason to 

believe that the cost thresholds and the cost --

the controls that went into the stringencies 

would be exactly the same, no matter whether it 

was 23 or 11 or five states, because most of

 these controls are well established.  They've

 been around for over 25 years.  And downwind 

sources are already using them to try to reduce 

their emissions. 

The -- the rule is trying to get the 

upwind sources not to do technical innovation or 

newfangled things but to get them into the 

middle of the pack that downwind sources are 

already doing. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that one of 

the states that is still subject to this 

requirement is paying too much, more than it 

would have paid if the plan had been calculated 

based on that state's situation alone or based 

on just the states that remain subject to the 

requirement at this time. 

I just want to make sure I understand 

your argument, the argument that you began with.

Was -- was it your argument that even if that is

 true, the -- the detriment to New York would be

 enough to outweigh the fact that those -- that 

state or those remaining states are paying what 

we might say simply, in simple terms, too much?

 Was that part of your -- was that your argument?

 MS. VALE: That is part of the

 argument, I -- yes.  Yes, because it's -- it's

 looking at -- and I think what should drive the 

Court's analysis in this unusual stay posture, 

what should inform it, is the statute.  And the 

statute has already done a little bit of this 

weighing of the interests between states and is 

highly protective. 

The point of the statute is to protect 

downwind states, not just the residents -- of 

course, that's important -- but also downwind 

industry from the free riding of upwind states. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that might be 

true, but does that answer the argument that the 

EPA should have considered what you -- that --

the argument that you just made? Did it --

that. That is part of the fundamental idea of

 how -- how cost -- significant contributions of

 pollution is defined.  The point of it is to say

 let's get the upwind sources doing the

 relatively less expensive controls that many

 downwind sources and -- and sources all around

 the country are already doing.

 So that was fundamental to the rule. 

And I think it is also a fundamental 

understanding of the rule that states can come 

in and out.  We have had experience with this 

under many prior ozone transport rules.  They 

were all done in this sort of multi-state way. 

I do think EPA could have written 23 different 

Federal Register notices, but I don't -- that --

that seems like form over substance. 

We have had states drop out. We have 

had one state, Georgia, remaining in a trading 

program by itself.  And if I could just maybe 

explain why the trading program is not 

interdependent in the sense that I think 

applicants are making it.  Two -- two -- two 

things there. 

First of all, as states drop out, 

supply and demand are going down roughly even.

also fewer market participants asking for --

 wanting allowances. 

Second, it is -- the states are not

 the market participants.  We are not left with

 10 market participants.  It is the power plants 

that are the market participants. There are

 currently about 360 market participants in the

 trading program.  That's why we have the

the emissions reductions are assessed 

collectively across the hundreds of EGU and 

non-EGU sources.

 cumulatively and collectively.

 MS. VALE: Well, I -- that is one

 piece of the step 3 analysis.  And I think what 

EPA is saying there is that, yes, they do look 

when they're doing the rule, is this going to 

have a meaningful effect? You don't want to do

 a rule that's not -- that turns out it's not 

doing anything.  Then EPA will probably have to 

go back to the -- the drawing board and make it 

more stringent in order to have a meaningful 

effect. 

But, ultimately, we know that we 

continue to have a meaningful effect because the 

costs and the emission reduction benefits that 

come out of Ohio and Indiana and all of the 

states still in the rule remain exactly the 

same --

Honors, first on emissions, second on the other 

fault lines and the rule that I mentioned, and

 the third on equities.

 The first is what you heard Ms. Vale 

just say is that the purpose of the Good

 Neighbor provision is to protect downwind states

 from emissions of upwind states. No. The 

purpose of the Good Neighbor provision is to 

reduce the significant contribution that upwind 

states make to downwind states. 

And that why -- that's why 11, Chief 

Justice Roberts, versus 23 matters.  That 

question about how many is a collective, how 

many hundreds of EGUs, how many hundreds of 

non-EGUs that are being regulated here for the 

first time, by the way, how many of those feed 

into the analysis is exactly the problem. 

We didn't have to seek 

reconsideration, Justice Gorsuch, on the 

question about whether EPA had significantly 

explained itself.  We raised the issue, we 

sought reconsideration in fact.  EPA still 

hasn't acted on reconsideration, which you can 

see in Note 9 of the Goffman Declaration.  We 

had no obligation to do anything more than that.

It was clear in the rule as evidenced 

by the fact that EPA put in a severability

 provision announcing its intention that

 something be severable.  Not an explanation but

 an intention.

 If there are 11 states in this rule,

 the answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, 

is that EPA would have had to ask whether or not 

there still would be a significant contribution, 

not just an air quality benefit downwind but a 

significant contribution given the costs on the 

industries and power points in those -- plants 

in those states. 

The fault lines throughout the rule 

I've already mentioned.  I mentioned in the 

opening it goes to your Court's second question. 

There are over-control issues here in addition 

to the reliability issues that were ignored by 

EPA. 

And the last thing I'd say is on the 

equities.  The equities are not balanced, 

Justice Kavanaugh.  The equities here are there 

are hundreds of millions if not billions of 

dollars in costs over the next 12 to 18 months 

coupled against 10 percent of the .66 average
