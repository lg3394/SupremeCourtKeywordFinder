 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-7386,

 McIntosh versus United States.

 MR. YUROWITZ:  Mr. Chief --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Yurowitz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN Y. YUROWITZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. YUROWITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Rule 32.2(b) states in unequivocal 

terms that a -- a district court must enter a 

preliminary order of forfeiture prior to 

sentencing.  In this case, no one disputes no 

such order was entered, and there's also no 

dispute why not, as the Second Circuit found, 

because the government did not submit one. 

Indeed, none was entered until three years after 

sentencing. 

Petitioner contends that Rule 32.2(b) 

is a mandatory claims-processing rule and the 

failure to enter the preliminary order of 

forfeiture is fatal to the government's ability 

to seek forfeiture.

Such a reading is consistent with the 

plain language of the rule, its structure and

 purpose.  The plain language requires entry of a

 preliminary order prior to sentencing.  This

 Court has never interpreted the term "must" to 

mean a mere time-related directive.

 Such an interpretation is also

 consistent with the rule's comprehensive

 structure pursuant to which forfeiture must be 

addressed.  Those directives start from the 

beginning of the case, continue through verdict, 

then prior to sentencing, at sentencing, and 

after sentencing.  This highly calibrated 

structure confirms the mandatory nature of the 

need to enter the preliminary order of 

forfeiture. 

The purpose of Rule 32.2(b)'s 

requirement to enter the preliminary order prior 

to sentencing also reflects the goal of 

procedural due process and finality, all of 

which are indicative of a prophylactive 

mandatory claim-processing rule. 

Finally, Rule 32.2(b)'s requirement to 

enter a preliminary order of forfeiture is 

nothing like those rules which this Court has

held were mere time-related directives.  Those

 cases involved either administrative rules and 

the concern of imposing mandatory conditions on 

bureaucratic agencies or rules designed to 

protect third parties, not before the court, 

such as the victims in Dolan and the public in

 Montalvo-Murillo. 

This Court should conclude that Rule 

32.2(b) is a mandatory -- claim-processing rule. 

I invite the Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But didn't your 

client -- didn't Petitioner have actual notice 

that the government was going to seek 

forfeiture? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  He had notice in the --

in the indictment in the bill of particulars 

from -- but, from that point on, the government 

was silent.  There was no notice -- the 

government provided no indication after verdict 

that it was going to be seeking forfeiture until 

literally the 11th hour, 59th minute, when the 

court said it was about to impose sentencing. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So how exactly was he 

prejudiced by what the government did here? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  He was prejudiced by a

loss of value on the car, and there were

 third-party rights, third-party claimants that 

are also prejudiced because, until a preliminary 

order of forfeiture is entered, third-party

 claimants cannot litigate their rights.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Were there any

 third-party claimants, though?

 MR. YUROWITZ:  The car was titled in 

his mother's name. She presumably would have 

been a third-party claimant.  And she -- she 

didn't get -- I -- I -- my understanding is she 

didn't even get notice. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  How does the 

harmless error rule apply here?  I mean -- I --

I understand you just indicated to Justice 

Thomas that your client is prejudiced, but does 

a court have an obligation to assess the 

harmlessness of -- of this rule violation?  Rule 

52 would normally require that. 

MR. YUROWITZ:  So Dolan set -- set 

forth three potential rules for -- the -- to --

to orient the discussion a little more

 precisely, we're dealing here with the Federal 

Rules of Criminal Procedure, which have a 

harmless error rule built into them and say that 

they apply with respect to all of the other

 rules.

 So what about that?

 MR. YUROWITZ:  So this -- even -- in 

this Court in Eberhart, when it was construing 

Rule 33, it didn't look to a harmless error rule 

because it -- held that it was a mandatory 

claim-processing rule. This Court has never 

really looked to harmless error when -- in the 

context of mandatory claim-processing rule even 

when they're rules, federal rules. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So even though the 

federal rules themselves say all of these rules 

are subject to a harmless error analysis, you 

would have us effectively carve out Rule 32? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  It -- it -- it's not 

just -- I -- I would carve -- I think this Court 

could carve out all mandatory claim-processing 

rules. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Thank you.

 claims-processing rule, you say that the result 

of that is that the Petitioner is entitled to

 enforce -- enforce it. And so what I'm trying 

to understand is, what does enforcement look 

like in this context? What does it mean to

 enforce a deadline regarding this kind of 

preliminary rule of forfeiture? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  When -- when -- when a 

preliminary order of forfeiture is not entered 

as it should be prior to sentencing, then the 

government loses its right to forfeiture. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But -- but I thought 

-- I thought the order -- the -- the response 

was going to be that you just get a do-over.  In 

other words, I mean, it's a -- it's a procedural 

rule that occurs prior to the sentencing. 

That's what you've argued, right?  You have to 

issue this preliminary order of forfeiture. 

And so let's say the court doesn't do 

that. You say that the individual should be 

entitled to enforce it.  And I guess what I'm 

asking is, isn't the scope of the enforcement

the argument that they need -- that the district 

court needs to do it over?

 MR. YUROWITZ:  The -- when you are 

construing a mandatory claim-processing rule, 

the effect of it is that if you don't stick to

 it -- if you don't -- if you don't carry out the

 duty, you lose the right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But that's -- but 

you say that's a jurisdictional rule. On page 2 

of your brief, you say, "most deadlines...  have 

consequences.  A missed jurisdictional deadline 

'prevents the court from permitting or taking 

the action to which the statute attached the 

deadline.'" 

So, if the same consequence applies to 

the claims-processing rule, I guess I'm 

confused. 

MR. YUROWITZ:  But the difference 

between a jurisdictional rule and a 

claims-processing rule is a jurisdictional can 

never be waived.  A mandatory claim-processing 

rule could be waived or forfeited.

assume what they would do is just, okay, here's 

-- now we're giving you notice, here's the 

preliminary order, and it'll be -- you know,

 sentencing will be in another week as opposed to

 that.

 If you think that what the rule is

 about is -- is allowing notice to the defendant 

so it's prepared for whatever the final order is 

going to say, it seems to me that that's -- even 

if it's jurisdictional, as you say, that means 

you can't rely on the existing order to give 

notice, but it doesn't mean you can't just give 

notice, you know, a week later, give him the 

same benefit that he would get if the rule were 

complied with. 

MR. YUROWITZ:  If -- if the notice 

came before sentencing and it was entered before 

sentencing, then there's not a problem.  The 

problem is, in this case, there was no order 

entered until three years after, at which point 

you're disrupting the finality of the sentence. 

This is -- forfeiture is an element of 

sentencing, and there's -- there's an element of 

finality to it, and that's one of the objectives

 It -- it also is designed to benefit

 third-party claimants because, until you have --

until you have entry of an order, third-party

 claimants can't even be litigated, which, in

 this case, there was no -- there was no notice

 served until 12 years after.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the -- a mandatory

 claims-processing rule is subject to waiver, 

unlike a jurisdictional rule.  So a person would 

have to object to the failure of the court. 

And once the person objects, won't the 

court just do what the court does, and what 

would be the difference? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  It -- it's our position 

that the -- the time to object is when the --

when a -- when the preliminary order of 

forfeiture is entered.  The government is 

equivocal as to what -- or -- precise time, but 

if -- it -- it's not too much to ask the 

government to, if they're seeking to deprive 

someone of property, to dot their I's, cross 

their T's, raise this issue before sentencing 

and -- and have the court address it.

not understanding. If the person objects at the 

time of sentencing, and then the court says, you

 know, you're right, I should enter a preliminary

 order and enters a preliminary order, then you

 have no complaint?

 MR. YUROWITZ:  Right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So isn't that just

 what's going to happen even if the court fails 

to enter a preliminary order prior to 

sentencing?  A person in your client's position 

will have to object.  Then the court will enter 

a preliminary order.  And I -- I guess what I'm 

saying is that the rule you're asking for will 

make no difference in the end in 99 percent of 

the cases. 

MR. YUROWITZ:  So -- we would take the 

position that the time to object is at the time 

a preliminary order of forfeiture.  Rule 32.2 

places no obligations on the -- on the 

defendant. 

What the government is seeking to do 

here is to shift the burden to the defendant. 

It's the government's obligation.  They're the

 If at the time a -- when -- if when it 

came back to the district court in this case and 

the government submitted their preliminary order 

of forfeiture and the defendant had kept quiet,

 yes, he waived it.  But, up until then, there

 was no waiver.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The -- and the typical

 mandatory claims-processing rule tells one of 

the parties to the case that if you want to 

assert a particular claim, you have to raise it. 

It puts the -- it imposes a duty on one of the 

parties. 

But Rule 32.2 places a -- places a 

duty on the judge. Do you have any examples of 

cases in which we have held that something is a 

mandatory claims-processing rule where the duty 

is placed on the court and not on one of the 

parties? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  Gonzalez versus Thaler 

and Santos-Zacaria are both obligations that are 

placed on the court.  A -- a -- a preliminary 

order -- it's an order.  It's an order of the 

court. It could only be entered on the -- by

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I asked you about 

remedy because I guess I'm -- I -- I think 

there's actually a deeper kind of procedural 

concern here that is making me wonder whether we

 can actually reach the merits of the question 

that you're asking in this case, and it comes 

from the fact that as I look at the procedural 

history of this case, your client actually was 

resentenced and procedurally resentenced 

properly. 

So this is what I mean, that you --

you are raising concerns right now about the 

process that the district court undertook to 

issue the first forfeiture order in this case. 

And you say the district court failed to issue 

the preliminary order of forfeiture before that 

sentence, and two years later, when it did issue 

a preliminary order of forfeiture with respect 

to that sentence, that was too late, that the 

first forfeiture order was invalid. 

But it looks from the procedural

forfeiture and you didn't object, sentenced your

You, I think, agreed to the forfeiture

 their right to -- lost their right to

 forfeiture.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I understand.

 But -- but that order doesn't exist anymore.  So

 how -- how do -- how do we give you a remedy --

even if you're right about what you're saying in 

this case, I guess I don't understand how we're

 in a position to give you any remedy today. 

That order has been vacated.  And what 

you're arguing is that order was defective 

because there was no preliminary order of 

forfeiture.  So, fine, that order doesn't exist 

anymore.  What -- so what -- what can we do 

about that now? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  It -- it -- it's --

it's the same -- it's the same defendant who's 

subject to sentencing.  It's what -- the -- the 

Petitioner's position is that the government has 

lost that right, whether it's this particular 

order or a later order.  If they've lost their 

right to sentencing, they've lost --

 the appellate process.  Obviously, because the 

Second Circuit had held at that point that

 forfeiture was still pending, he was going to

 negotiate -- work with them on a number which 

was substantially lower, but at the same time,

preliminary order of forfeiture is based on the 

government requests indicating that they're 

going to be seeking forfeiture and they're

 providing the court with the information.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What do you do

 about the different language of 32.2(A), which 

does say "a court must not enter a judgment of

 forfeiture in a criminal proceeding unless the

 indictment... contains notice..."?  In other 

words, the specific consequence is set forth in 

the rule there, but it's not in the rule at 

issue here. 

MR. YUROWITZ:  So -- I -- I think 

there's a specific reason why in A it had to 

specify the consequence, because it's based on 

the underlying statute.  And in the underlying 

statute, it talks in permissive terms.  This --

the word used is the government may -- may file 

a bill of particulars. And the rules wanted to 

take it further, so, therefore, they wanted to 

make it mandatory, so they indicated a 

consequence. 

When it comes to (b)(1)(A), that --

that concern doesn't apply.

had of a mandatory jurisdictional rule, and as 

you pointed out, there really aren't.

 But I'm wondering how I can view this

 rule as a -- mandatory jurisdictional view when 

it has the biggest carveout I've ever seen. It

 says you have to -- the court has to file a 

preliminary order before sentencing "unless

 doing so is impractical." 

So why can't it do it an hour before 

the sentencing? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  So, Justice Sotomayor, 

impractical does not mean in -- inconvenient. 

It -- it -- dictionaries define it as incapable. 

It -- it -- that exception doesn't give the 

court the ability to -- to impose an order at 

any --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, having been 

a district court judge and having hundreds of 

sentences on my docket at one point, sometimes 

it's not really inconvenient.  It's almost 

impossible to keep up with those things, and you 

do -- you do do it a little bit later. 

But my point is, who decides that?

appeals now has to hold a hearing to see why the 

district court judge didn't issue the order a

 month before, two months before, three months

 before?  I guess my point is, generally, when we

 think of mandatory rules, they set a fixed goal, 

a fixed deadline, something that you can know 

and meet without discretion being involved.

 MR. YUROWITZ:  So Rule 32.2(b) imposes

 that same firm deadline.  That's sentencing. 

The impractical exception is only that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, again, an 

hour is inconvenient, but how about a day?  How 

about two? How about three?  That -- my whole 

point is that once you build in discretion, how 

can you call it mandatory in the -- in the sense 

of it being jurisdictional? 

MR. YUROWITZ:  At -- at -- at that 

point, if the defend -- nothing -- none of this 

happens in a vacuum.  The government, had they 

done their jobs -- job properly, they would have 

come to the court saying we're seeking 

forfeiture in this case.  They would have 

provided the information.

couldn't get to it because it was impractical,

I know yours is years, so that

 wouldn't be covered, but in the typical case, it 

not only has to be impractical, but all you have

 to do is sufficiently.  It seems that there's a

 lot of wiggle room throughout the rule that

 seems inconsistent with the general notion of

 mandatory requirements.

 MR. YUROWITZ:  Even this Court in

 Eberhart, when it was dealing with Rule 33, it 

has the same ability for a judge to extend the 

deadline.  Defense counsel could make a motion 

saying probably it's -- I can't do it 

sufficiently in time, and the rule permits a 

court to extend it. 

This -- this Court held that it was a 

-- a mandatory claim-processing rule.  So the 

notion that there's flexibility doesn't 

undermine the fact that it's a -- a 

claim-processing rule. 

The point is it's a rule that's 

designed to provide a -- a -- a -- a litigant 

with protections because the government is 

seeking to deprive him of his property.  A 

hundred and fifty years ago, this Court already 

said in French versus Edwards, where there's a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW GUARNIERI

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Mr. Chief Justice --

excuse me. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

The timing requirement in Rule 

32.2(b)(2)(B) is mandatory, not discretionary, 

but characterizing that requirement as mandatory 

doesn't answer the question presented in this 

case. The question here is, what follows when a 

district court violates the rule?  What are the 

consequences?

is that a violation of Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) should

 be treated like any other garden-variety 

procedural error in the sentencing process. 

When a court commits a procedural error at 

sentencing, the normal thing to do is to apply 

Rule 52, which is the provision in the Federal 

Rules that codifies principles of harmless error

 and plain error.

 Under Rule 52(a), if an error does not 

affect the defendant's substantial rights, it 

must be disregarded as harmless.  Petitioner 

tries to avoid the application of harmless error 

principles by characterizing this particular 

requirement as a mandatory claim-processing 

rule. 

Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) is not such a rule 

for all the reasons that this Court identified 

in Dolan with respect to the analogous timing 

requirement in the Mandatory Victims Restitution 

Act. 

Let me just emphasize three of the 

considerations that the Court stressed in Dolan: 

text, context, and purpose. 

Textually, the rule here imposes an 

obligation on the court, not the litigants, and

it does not specify any sanction for the court's

 violation.  That text operates in the broader 

context of a statutory framework that makes 

clear that criminal forfeiture is a mandatory

 consequence of conviction and that forfeiture is 

part of the sentence imposed for the offense.

 The purpose of requiring the entry of 

a preliminary order before sentencing is to 

ensure that the forfeiture that is actually 

imposed at the sentencing itself is accurate and 

complete. 

Accordingly, when a district court 

neglects to enter a preliminary order of 

forfeiture before sentencing, in violation of 

Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), the court may nonetheless 

proceed to order forfeiture at the sentencing 

itself as long as the court's violation was 

harmless. 

And we think that's what occurred 

here. The district court orally ordered 

Petitioner to forfeit the proceeds of his Hobbs 

Act robberies and a car that he purchased with 

those proceeds, despite the absence of a 

preliminary order before sentencing.  That error 

was harmless.

I -- I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel for

 Petitioner said that the government should be

 held to -- when it takes a person's property, to

 cross its T's and dot its I's. How do you

 respond to that?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, Justice Thomas, 

we take our obligations to the court seriously

 in this context. And, certainly, the government 

has an important role to play in ensuring that 

district courts comply with the strictures of 

Rule 32.2, including Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B).  But 

that specific provision imposes an obligation on 

the court, not -- not on the government. 

And to your broader point, Justice 

Thomas, I -- I -- I think the -- the principal 

protection for defendants in criminal forfeiture 

is that the obligation is on the United States 

to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 

defendant committed the offenses for which 

Congress specified criminal forfeiture as a 

penalty. 

So Petitioner here and defendants 

generally are entitled to all of the myriad 

protections in the criminal process.  We were

 We presented nine days' worth of testimony

 robberies.  And forfeiture is a consequence of

 the defendant's violation of the Hobbs Act.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, you

 mentioned Rule 52 in your opening.  I -- I was a 

little surprised, though, in reading your brief, 

it didn't appear until page 42. 

Can -- can you explain -- and I --

I -- I'm not being critical. I'm -- I'm just 

wondering, is there a nuance here I'm missing? 

But, you know, this Rule 32 is a rule. It's not 

a statute.  It's a rule.  And all of the rules 

are subject to harmless error analysis.  And I 

would have thought that would have been like the 

straightest, narrowest shot through this case, 

but -- but I'm wondering whether I'm missing 

something. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, you -- you are 

not, Justice Gorsuch. We are trying to 

triangulate from the Court's existing precedent.

 as mandatory claim-processing rules.

 And violations of those other rules

 are not subject to harmless error analysis.  And 

the key case there, I think, is Eberhart

 addressing Rule 33, which is the rule specifying 

the time limits for moving for a new trial after

 conviction.

 I think the same analysis would apply 

to Rule 35, which is the provision that 

specifies the time limits for correcting a 

sentence after it has been imposed. 

Those are mandatory and inflexible 

deadlines.  And a district court does --

generally cannot ignore those deadlines if a

 here. 

Really, it's Petitioner who's seeking 

to avoid the application of what the default 

framework here would be by characterizing this 

as a mandatory claims-processing rule.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Just one more

 question.  So, if -- if we agree with that, are 

you asking us to apply the harmless error 

standard ourselves in this case, or is a remand 

appropriate for a court to assess that question? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I think the 

Second Circuit already determined that any error 

here was harmless, as did the district court. 

Both of those courts considered what we think 

are the right factors in this context, and that 

is did the defendant have notice of the 

forfeiture and was he given an opportunity to 

contest it before the court ordered the 

forfeiture as part of the sentencing process. 

And Petitioner had both of those 

things here.  He was on notice that the 

government was seeking this forfeiture both 

through the indictment, the bill of particulars.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you 

talked about this being a court obligation, and 

I agree, but the government has an important 

role. Here, the government promised to or was 

asked to prepare orders and I think at least 

twice failed to do so. 

A ruling in your favor that this is a 

time-related directive seems to me is an 

inducement to encourage the government not to 

respond to a district court order. 

I have to say I read this and I 

thought to myself this is a very strange 

district court.  If a government lawyer had ever 

done that to me as a district court judge, I 

don't think I would have been very kind. 

But what inducements are we creating

by not calling this a -- if not mandatory, a

 claim-processing rule as opposed to a

 time-related directive?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, Justice 

Sotomayor, I don't think characterizing this

 provision as a time-related directive would

 encourage violations of the rule if -- if that 

is Your Honor's concern. There are going to be 

substantial incentives for the government to 

encourage the district court to comply with this 

rule. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What are the 

incentives? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, the entry of a 

preliminary order of forfeiture before 

sentencing can be a basis for seizing property. 

And so the government in many cases is going to 

have an interest in ensuring that it has legal 

authority to seize and maintain assets that 

should be subject to forfeiture or that will be 

subject to forfeiture at the conclusion of the 

case. So I think that's one substantial 

incentive. 

Another, we often have an incentive to 

ensure that the Court enters a preliminary order

because that can provide notice to third parties

 that some particular specific asset is going to

 be subject to forfeiture.  It helps us to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That didn't happen

 here.

 MR. GUARNIERI:  -- defeat arguments 

later in the proceeding that some third party 

comes in and claims that it was a bona fide 

purchaser of the assets if they were transferred 

during the course of the criminal case. 

So, I mean, we -- we -- there are good 

reasons here that it is Department of Justice 

policy to encourage district courts to enter 

preliminary orders of forfeiture before 

sentencing -- as Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) requires. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have one last 

question. Do you take a position on the Seventh 

Circuit's suggestion in U.S. versus Lee that you 

have to at least announce a forfeiture at 

sentencing, that you can't just not say anything 

and then later order one? And they said that 

might be jurisdictional.

MR. GUARNIERI:  That -- that's right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- do you see a

 ruling here as permitting courts to do that as

 well?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  As I understand the

 Seventh -- the Seventh Circuit's decision in 

Lee, the court suggested that although Rule 

32.2(b)(2)(B), the provision that is at issue in 

the proceeding before this Court, is best 

characterized as a time-related directive, 

perhaps the timing requirements with respect to 

the entry of the final order of forfeiture at 

the sentencing hearing itself, perhaps those 

requirements should be treated as mandatory 

claim-processing rules. 

That was not directly at issue in Lee. 

We haven't briefed that issue here.  I don't 

think anything that the Court says here about 

32.2(b)(2)(B) would necessarily dictate an 

answer with respect to what is Rule 

32.2(b)(4)(B). 

And -- and so I don't think the Court 

needs to address it. We haven't taken a 

position.  I -- I would say, in general, I think

that's a harder case for us, and it's a harder 

case for some of the reasons that the dissenting 

Justices identified in Dolan.

 And that is, in general, the rule here

 contemplates that the court will announce the

 forfeiture as part of imposing sentence on the

 defendant.  And if the court purports to act

 after sentencing, if it fails to address 

forfeiture at sentencing and it's acting after 

the sentencing proceeding, then we have a -- a 

harder set of issues.  I mean, that's not just a 

Rule 32.2 problem.  It can also be a problem 

under the various statutes that specify that 

forfeiture shall be ordered at sentencing. 

And -- as I was alluding to earlier in 

my colloquy with Justice Gorsuch, there are 

constraints under, in particular, Rule 35 on a 

district court's authority to alter or correct a 

sentence after it's been imposed.  So there are 

a lot of other extrinsic considerations that 

could come into play with respect to the final 

order at sentencing. 

But those things don't support 

Petitioner's position here.  This case is 

limited to just the asserted error of failing to

 currently pending appeal in the Second Circuit.

 If this Court adopts Petitioner's view 

that this is a mandatory claim-processing rule, 

his position as I understand it is that 

violation of that rule is, I -- I think he said 

this morning, fatal to the government's ability

 to obtain criminal forfeiture.  And so I think 

the case would go back to the Second Circuit, 

and the Second Circuit could then entertain his 

argument that even the now operative new 

forfeiture order should be vacated because it is 

the result of a series of proceedings that never 

should have occurred under his understanding of 

how the rule works.  We --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  But, under 

his own argument, didn't he forfeit that claim? 

I mean, he says that if it's a claim processing 

rule, if you don't raise it, you lose it.  And 

at the time of the second forfeiture order, he 

didn't raise it. 

MR. GUARNIERI:  I -- I think we would 

have reasonable arguments that, in fact, he has 

forfeited it even if it is a mandatory 

claim-processing rule, but I think those would 

go to the merits.  I don't think that those

before the Court today. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH: Do you think there 

are some mandatory claim-processing rules that

 are directed to courts or executive agencies 

rather than to parties?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Petitioner has yet to 

identify an example of such a rule. I mean, 

there are rules, for example, the provision of 

the INA that was at issue in Santos-Zacaria, 

which my friend mentioned this morning, that are 

phrased in terms of action by the court but 

clearly are designed to impose on the parties an 

obligation to take some step, such as exhausting 

administrative remedies. 

We're not aware of and Petitioner has 

not identified another example of a rule like 

this where the obligation rests squarely on the 

judicial officer.  And -- and that's one of the 

reasons that this case is similar to Dolan. 

The -- the other case that I think is 

-- is directly on point here is 

Montalvo-Murillo, which is the case involving a 

provision of the Bail Reform Act that imposed on

 obligation to hold a pretrial detention hearing 

within a specified time, and the Court said that

 even if a -- if the judicial officer violates 

that deadline, it doesn't mean that the

 defendant walks free.  You can have a later 

pretrial detention hearing because the error was

 harmless.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Is there something 

significant about that line that we might

that there shall be forfeiture, right?  I mean, 

that -- that's Congress's directive to us. 

And often government agencies and 

perhaps courts miss deadlines.  But Dolan kind 

of recognized what I'll call a -- a 

better-late-than- never rule in complying with 

congressional directives.  Thoughts? 

MR. GUARNIERI:  Justice Gorsuch, I --

I think that's right, and -- and to -- to return 

to an exchange that we had earlier, I mean, we 

have approached this case through the lens of 

Dolan. And Dolan, one of the considerations the 

Court emphasized in Dolan was that the statutory 

obligation in that case was placed on the court,

not on the litigants, which is a sign that this

 might be something other than a mandatory

 claim-processing rule.

 Another consideration that the Court 

stressed in that case was that, as the name of 

that statute suggests, the -- the restitution 

was mandatory. And so too here criminal

 forfeiture is mandatory.  Those are both

 important components of our argument. 

If you think about this, when -- when 

you arrive at the sentencing proceeding, the 

district court who has failed to enter a 

preliminary order of forfeiture faces a kind of 

dilemma because, on the one hand, you have a 

perceived violation of Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), 

assuming the impracticality exception doesn't 

apply, and on the other hand, you have numerous 

interlocking statutes that direct the court, 

command the court, to order forfeiture when the 

prerequisites are satisfied. 

And so I think all of that -- that 

surrounding mandatory framework is another very 

important piece of the puzzle here.  And if the 

Court accepts that and accepts that those are 

two of the considerations that support treating

 time-related directive rather than a mandatory

 outer limits if -- if that was the -- the --

I'm wondering, what are the outer limits of the

explore with you, and is the government 

comfortable with a rule that it -- it -- those 

are matters directed to the court by statute and 

have mandatory directives?

right. I think those are the two key 

considerations here.  There are -- there are 

other considerations that I think also support 

treating this case the same way the Court 

treated -- rather, treating this rule the same 

way the Court treated the statute in Dolan, but

 those are certainly the two principal ones that

 we emphasize in our brief.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is it the 

government's position that this is the kind of

 situation that if he's -- that -- that he's

 right or wrong about his argument that if a

 court blows the deadline, there can never be

 another forfeiture in the case?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I think that's 

another significant way in which our approach 

differs from Petitioner's approach.  I -- I 

think that, like other procedural errors, if 

there is a harmful violation of Rule 

32.2(b)(2)(B) or a non-harmless violation, the 

remedy should be that the defendant in that case 

then gets the forfeiture proceedings that Rule 

32.2 is supposed to provide. 

So, if you arrive at sentencing or the 

case goes up on appeal and there's been a 

violation of the requirement to enter a 

preliminary order of forfeiture beforehand, the 

result should not simply be that the defendant 

in that case is absolved of what is supposed to 

be a mandatory part of the sentence for the 

defendant's offense.  The result should be a

remand to the district court to -- to get it

 right.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  What have we said in

 other claims-processing scenarios? And is that

 consistent with what normally happens if there

 is a claims-processing rule?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  I -- I -- I am not

 aware of an example in which the Court has

 identified something as a mandatory 

claim-processing rule but nonetheless found that 

a violation of that mandatory rule could be 

remedied by a redo of the proceedings in the 

district court. 

Ordinarily, mandatory 

claims-processing rules are -- and it's a 

category that is adjacent to jurisdictional 

rules. These are inflexible rules that impose 

on the parties some obligation that if they fail 

and the other party objects, the rule can be 

strictly enforced. 

And Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B), like other 

requirements that attend the sentencing process, 

it doesn't really make sense to treat the rule 

that way. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And why is that?

MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, because it would

 make Rule 32.2(b)(2)(B) a kind of aberrational

 part of sentencing.  If the district court fails 

to take the very steps that are identified in 

Rule 32 with respect to the sentencing process,

 the -- the ordinary remedy for that is that you

 redo the sentencing.

 Indeed, even with respect to errors

 that this Court has identified as structural, 

meaning they are not amenable to harmless error 

principles, the remedy for a structural -- error 

is that you have a retrial or you have a 

resentencing. 

It doesn't mean that the defendant is 

simply -- can -- cannot be convicted of the 

offense or cannot be subject to a penalty that 

Congress has otherwise specified for that 

offense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but 

there are situations in which it does mean that. 

So just because it doesn't in this particular 

situation, there are others, like the situation 

in Dolan.  You're putting an awful lot of weight 

on a sharply divided opinion in Dolan.

 Justice, I -- I recognize that the dissenting 

Justices in Dolan had some very compelling and

 persuasive things to say.  One point I would

 make, and -- and we make this point in our 

brief, this case is one step removed from Dolan 

in the sense that here, the error is with 

respect to a part of the process that is

 antecedent to the sentencing itself.

 And so, here, the district court 

failed to enter a preliminary order of 

sentencing beforehand, but it did orally order 

the forfeiture of the property and -- and orally 

order a forfeiture money judgment at the 

sentencing itself. 

And that's unlike the situation in 

Dolan, in which the -- the -- the sentencing 

court in that case left open the precise amount 

of restitution and then acted well after the 

90-day deadline in the Mandatory Victims 

Restitution Act. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just 

because it doesn't have any serious 

consequences, if you're right that you just have 

a, you know, start over again a second time, I 

mean, there are situations where it would.

And I'm wondering if -- to what extent 

we should be concerned about the remedial aspect 

of it simply because it sort of could be a

 harmless foul in this case?

 MR. GUARNIERI:  Well, I mean, if 

you're thinking about this case in terms of, you

 know, what is the appropriate remedy for a 

violation of this rule, I do think we have the 

better argument on the equities there. 

I mean, this is a mandatory component 

of the sentence. It is in that sense akin to a 

-- a statutory minimum sentence. If the 

district court commits an error in the process 

of imposing that mandatory sentence, it would be 

anomalous to conclude that the result is that 

the defendant is simply absolved of a -- of a 

consequence that Congress has made mandatory for 

that particular offense.  It would really -- I 

mean, it would, as I said, make Rule 

32.2(b)(2)(B) stick out like a thumb in the 

sentencing process. 

I think the other thing I would say is 

that our approach here, which has stressed 

harmless error, means that -- I mean, the -- the 

delta between that approach and a -- a mandatory

 about the small class of errors in which --

excuse me, the -- the -- the -- the set of cases 

in which the error is harmless.

 And we think, if the error is 

harmless, I mean, by definition, that means that 

any procedural error did not affect the 

defendant's substantial rights, there is no good 

reason if the error is harmless for the court to 

lack the authority to just proceed at the 

sentencing proceeding itself to order the 

forfeiture of the property that Congress has 

made subject to forfeiture.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. YUROWITZ:  So -- I -- I'd just 

like to go back to Justice Gorsuch's question 

about harmless error.  The reason why there's no

harmless error analysis is because this Court

 has never really applied harm -- harmless error 

in the context of either a mandatory

 claim-processing rule or -- or time-related

 directives.

 Indeed, in Dolan, Chief Justice --

Justice Roberts pointed out that it's a rule 

with no consequence because the majority said, 

even in unlikely instances where the delay does 

cause the defendant prejudice, the defendant 

remains free to ask the court to take that 

account. 

There's no obligation on the court to 

take that into account.  So this Court has never 

really applied harmless error analysis in this 

context.  And I think the reason why the -- why 

these mandatory claim-processing rules are 

treated different and why Rule 32.2(b) should be 

within that bucket is because it's not simply 

the defendant that's before the court whose 

rights are being affected. 

There are third-party claimants' 

rights who are being affected who -- the -- at 

the time when the court is conducting any 

analysis, they're not even there before the

court, and their rights are just being put to 

the side because they're not before the court.

 Dolan's finding of a time-related

 directive was a very small slice.  It -- it's

 just -- it's a -- it's a -- generally, it 

involves administrative action where, obviously, 

the court is reluctant and recognizes that 

administrative agencies, they're saddled with a 

lot of obligations, and they may not be able to 

keep their -- their obligations in a timely 

manner. 

There are only really two exceptions, 

and that's in the bail context, where there's a 

public safety issue, and there's a pending case 

that's ongoing, unlike Rule 32.2(b), which is 

sentencing -- the final -- there's a finality 

element to sentencing, and there's Dolan itself, 

which involved victims.  Victims are not the 

beneficiaries of Rule 32.2(b). 

So I think that's why harmless error 

should not apply, because there is this category 

of a mandatory claim-processing rule.  My friend 

characterized it in terms that both -- that 

there's no rule in terms of the -- where a 

mandatory claim processing is imposed on the --

on the court.  He said -- but, you know, the --

I think the two cases, the Santos-Zacaria and 

Gonzalez versus Thaler, he said those were an

 obligation on the party.

 It's the same thing here.  A district

 court coming in to impose forfeiture could do 

nothing without the government providing them

 the ammunition, and the first thing is the 

government coming in and saying post-verdict, 

pre-sentencing, we are going to seek forfeiture 

in this matter. 

The government certainly has the 

right, even though they filed a bill of 

particulars, even though they put it in the 

indictment, they don't have to continue on that 

forfeiture.  They could -- they could -- they 

have the discretion. They may have felt in the 

facts of this case the defendant is getting 

sentenced to 60 years, he's going to be the rest 

of his life in prison, we're not going to 

proceed with forfeiture. 

And certainly not an obligation on the 

defendant to say:  Hey -- are you really --

you're -- are you letting me off the hook?  It 

was the government's obligation to come in.

There was not a word from the government in this

 case post-verdict, in the sentencing memo --

memorandum, when they got up to argue at 

sentencing. There was not a word about -- at

 sentencing.

 So, in that terms, the -- the -- it's

 the government -- the -- it's the government

 that really bore the burden. And, yes, the

 court -- it's an obligation on the court. 

The -- the court needs the government to come 

forward with that. 

So, in that sense, it's both -- it's 

like -- it's -- it's -- it's the same situation 

as Gonzalez versus Thaler, where there's an 

obligation on the court to indicate in the COA 

what -- what the constitutional basis is.  And 

if anything, in -- in that case, it was more of 

an obligation on the Court because the Court had 

an independent basis to decide that there was 

a -- a constitutional basis. 

And -- and the other -- the point 

about the -- the fact that the forfeiture is 

mandatory and the -- and the statute makes it 

mandatory, but it also in the same breath says 

it's going to be subject to the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure, which is Rule 32.2.

 And matter of fact, even those

 forfeiture is mandatory.  If the government

 fails to allege it in the indictment, there's no 

-- even the government doesn't dispute that they

 cannot receive forfeiture.

 So the rules could impose more 

obligations on the government -- on -- on the

 court than specified in the -- in the -- in 

the -- in the statute and it doesn't undermine 

the mandatory nature of -- of the obligation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.
