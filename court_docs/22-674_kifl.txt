 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-674,

 Campos-Chaves versus Garland, and the

 consolidated case.

 Mr. McCloud.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES L. McCLOUD

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

MR. McCLOUD: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Each of the non-citizens in these 

cases failed to attend a removal hearing after 

receiving written notice of the time and place 

of that hearing.  Under the rule adopted by the 

Ninth Circuit, however, the non-citizens can 

rescind their in absentia removal orders based 

on a supposed lack of notice. 

That holding defies text, context, and 

common sense, and it threatens to unsettle 

hundreds of thousands of in absentia orders that 

had been entered over the course of nearly three 

decades.  In reaching that extraordinary result, 

the Ninth Circuit misread the statutory scheme 

and this Court's decisions in Pereira and

 Niz-Chavez.

 As to the statute, the Ninth Circuit

 is wrong that the omission of time and place 

information in a notice to appear renders all

 subsequent notices invalid.  Congress created 

two distinct forms of notice, and it made both

 of them potential grounds for in absentia

 removal.

 The removal orders in these cases were 

based on notices of hearing that specified a new 

time and place for the removal proceedings and 

that warned the non-citizens of the consequences 

of failing to attend those proceedings.  That's 

all Section 1229 requires for a notice of 

hearing to be valid. 

As to Pereira and Niz-Chavez, we 

acknowledge that the Court is not writing on a 

blank slate when it comes to notices to appear, 

but Pereira and Niz-Chavez do not decide these 

cases. The question presented today was not 

briefed in those cases, it was not argued in 

those cases, and was not necessary to resolve in 

those cases.  The Court's narrow decisions do 

not create the sweeping defense to removal that 

the non-citizens here seek.

I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, Mr. McCloud,

 Pereira seems to work against you, so I think

 you -- it would be good for you to spend a -- a 

bit of time on that.

 MR. McCLOUD: Certainly, Your Honor. 

So I think that the important thing about 

Pereira is that it was a narrow decision that

 decided a particular question presented, and 

that question presented was about the 

interaction between the stop-time rule in 

1229b(d)(1) and the notice to appear 

requirements. 

And if I could point to where in the 

Court's opinion that holding appears, it's at 

the beginning of Part II B of the opinion.  This 

is on page 2114 of the Supreme Court Reporter 

version if you have that available. 

And at the beginning of the first 

paragraph of that section of the opinion, the 

Court says, "The statutory text alone is enough 

to resolve this case."  It then proceeds to 

analyze the text of the two provisions that I 

just referenced. 

Now it's true that after this point in

the opinion, there is additional analysis, but I

 think much of that additional analysis is dicta. 

The Court said that that analysis supported or

 bolstered or reinforced the conclusion it had

 already reached.  And I think that's 

particularly true of the statements that the

 non-citizens and the Ninth Circuit have relied

 on in Pereira.

 To go directly to the statement about 

the -- the meaning of "change," the meaning of 

"change" was not briefed in Pereira. It was not 

argued in Pereira.  And so the Court in Pereira 

did not have before it, the wealth of argument 

and evidence that we have brought to bear on 

that question in this case. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I take the point, 

Mr. McCloud, but, you know, it is a very 

directed statement.  By allowing for a change or 

a postponement to a new time or place, paragraph 

(2) presumes that the government has already 

served an NTA that specified a time and place as 

required by (a)(1). 

And I don't think we were looking to 

reach out and decide a lot of questions that 

weren't before us. I think -- and this was a --

you know, eight justices joined this opinion. 

It just seemed the sort of obvious understanding 

of the statutory scheme. So, you know, even if 

it's dicta, it reflected what eight people 

thought was pretty obvious when you looked at

 the statute.

 MR. McCLOUD: So, Justice Kagan, if I

 can take that in -- in two pieces.

 So there are two sentences there.  The 

first one you referred to talks about a 

presumption in the statute that the notice of 

hearing will follow the notice to appear. And I 

agree, I -- I don't think that there is any 

dispute that there is such a presumption in the 

statute.  But identifying that presumption does 

not answer the question in this case, which is 

what happens when the presumption is not met and 

the notice to appear did not contain the time 

and place information. 

Then the second statement, which I 

acknowledge is a difficult statement for me, is 

the statement about the meaning of "change." 

And I -- I -- I do think that's dicta.  I also 

think it's incorrect dicta, and it's not 

surprising the Court got that incorrect because

it just did not have the evidence like the

 dictionary definitions, like the contextual 

evidence about the meaning of "change" that we 

have brought to the Court's attention in our 

briefing in this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McCloud, that 

-- that seems to beg the question. The finding 

in that case, and since I wrote it --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- was that the 

statutory presumption commanded by Congress, who 

knew full well that the government was giving 

notices with TBAs, time and place to be 

announced, regularly, was contrary to that 

history.  They wanted these notices to be full 

and complete.  That's what we held. 

And having held that, I think there's 

a presumption that you have to look at the 

statute in that context, that there will always 

either -- they will always start with a proper 

notice to appear, and if you're going to change 

the time and place, you're going to give a new 

time and place. 

I -- I -- I don't understand that a 

new time and place is something different than

what you've already specified.

 MR. McCLOUD: And, Justice Sotomayor,

 in this case, we think that we did satisfy that 

burden because we did provide a new time and

 place. We told the non-citizens where their 

removal hearings would be held, and so they had 

the information they needed to attend.

 And so I -- I don't think that 

"change" is actually the operative word in the 

statutory scheme, but I don't want to fight you 

too hard on that because I do think that even if 

you think that a notice of hearing must change a 

previously set time or place for the hearing, 

that requirement is satisfied here because the 

ordinary meaning of the word "change" is very 

broad, and it encompasses the process of going 

from --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So change is no 

change? Meaning you haven't set a time and 

place and we're going to change that and set 

what? Another no time and place? 

MR. McCLOUD: Your Honor, what we have 

done --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're saying no, 

it's going to be a time and place now.

MR. McCLOUD: Your Honor, what we have 

done in the TB NTAs is to tell the non-citizen 

you're going to have a hearing. We don't know 

when that hearing will be, but we have changed

 from that placeholder time to a specific time.

 And we think that under the ordinary 

meaning of "change," particularly as it's used 

in this statutory scheme, going from an 

indeterminate time and place to a determined one 

is a kind of change. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McCloud --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But didn't you lose 

that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Didn't you lose that 

argument in Niz-Chavez?  I mean, I -- I -- I 

understand and take your point, but I thought 

the Court said you really couldn't interpret the 

statute in that way or the word "change" in that 

way. 

MR. McCLOUD: Respectfully, Justice 

Jackson, I -- I don't agree.  I think the only 

issue that the Court decided in Niz-Chavez was 

whether we could compile two documents together 

to create "a" notice to appear, and the Court

said that that definite article "a" indicated

 that the notice to appear needed to be a single

 document. 

And so we are not disputing for 

purposes of these cases that the notices to 

appear alone could not be the basis for in 

absentia removal, but what's critical about this

 case and what distinguishes this case from

 Pereira and Niz-Chavez is that Congress here 

created two forms of notice and it made both of 

them relevant for purpose of in absentia removal 

in a way that they are not relevant for purposes 

of this topic --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Can you say more 

about that --

notice?  What do you mean? 

MR. McCLOUD: I mean that they created

appear, and the paragraph (2) notice, the notice 

of hearing or, as the other side refers to it, 

the notice of change.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- operate 

completely independently of one another? 

MR. McCLOUD: They're independent in 

the sense that they can both be independent

 valid bases for in absentia removal.  I take the 

point that the notice to appear is what 

initiates the proceeding, and so, some sense,

 you need to have a proceeding in order for there 

to be a notice of hearing to -- to alter that 

proceeding. 

But I don't think it is the case that 

the TBD status of the notice to appear in any 

way invalidates the later notice of hearing, and 

that's because the statute is very clear about 

the requirements for a valid notice of hearing. 

It needs to set the new time and place, and we 

did that in this case. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. McCloud, what 

would happen if the non-citizen showed up to the 

right time and place in response to the notice 

of hearing, but the NTA had been incomplete? 

Would that be grounds for the 

non-citizen objecting that the entire proceeding 

was invalid?  Because, after all, the statute

shall be provided. So, if the date and time was 

omitted from the initial one, would that be 

grounds for an invalidation of a proceeding?

 MR. McCLOUD: No, Justice Barrett. 

All of the courts of appeals that have

 considered that issue and the Board when it has

 considered that issue has said that the

 requirements, both the statutory requirements 

and the regulatory requirements, regarding the 

notice to appear and the information it has to 

contain are claims processing rules, they are 

not jurisdictional rules, so they do not divest 

the immigration court of jurisdiction if there 

is information missing from the notice to 

appear.

this is what I take from your brief, and I want

there has been a notice to appear because, 

otherwise, well, both because of the word

 position that once the notice of hearing arrives

 telling the non-citizen where and when to show 

up, even if there's some information lacking --

and let's say it's information that's even maybe 

more significant than the date and time that the 

government has been omitting and it's maybe an

That the alien, by versus -- by virtue

to show up because he's on notice, it's not like 

he's not aware that he is in contact with, you 

know, Immigration and that there are removal

created by the notice of a hear -- of hearing to 

show up and at that point to register any 

objections he may have to the incomplete NTA.

you're talking about or the blank document 

hypothetical that the other side has raised, and 

if I could go into those protections.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Sure.

 MR. McCLOUD: The first is the 

regulatory requirement that the notice to appear 

contain the charging information. So, if we had 

a blank document or a document that was missing 

the charges against the non-citizen --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But don't you need, 

and I'm sorry to interrupt -- but don't you --

I'm sorry, don't you need need the protection 

from the statute itself?  Because the regulatory 

requirement can be subject to change.  So I 

think your better argument comes from the clear 

and convincing evidence requirement in the 

statute itself. 

MR. McCLOUD: That was my second 

response, Your Honor, which is we bear the 

burden by clear and convincing evidence to prove 

that the non-citizen both received notice and 

that they are removable as charged.  And so, if 

you have a document that lacks charges, we could 

not prove that the non-citizen actually is 

removable.

And then the third --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose -- I'm sorry.

 MR. McCLOUD: Well, the third 

protection I was going to refer to is the fact 

that in absentia removal is not automatic. 

There is an immigration judge who is sitting on 

the other side of the bench and who has to 

review the documents and decide whether in 

absentia removal is appropriate. 

And so I think it is highly unlikely 

that an -- an -- an immigration judge in the 

circumstances with the blank document or the 

document without charges would enter in 

absentia. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose the (a)(1) 

notice didn't have the right to counsel in it. 

MR. McCLOUD: So the -- the answer I 

think is the same as before.  We view the right 

to counsel information obviously as an important 

piece of information, but the lack of that 

information does not affect the validity of the 

proceedings. 

So, if the -- the non-citizen --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. So it does 

suggest -- I mean, you're -- you're not informed

of your right to counsel.  Nonetheless, you have 

to show up. And I don't see that any of your 

safeguards actually protect the alien, the

 non-citizen, in that situation.

 I mean, what's going to prevent the

 non-citizen from being ordered removed, not

 being able to reopen, notwithstanding that he's

 never been told that he has a right to a lawyer?

 MR. McCLOUD: What prevents that 

result, Your Honor, is the regulations that I 

was referring to.  If the notice to appear does 

not contain the information about the right to 

counsel, that is an incomplete notice to appear 

that would be rejected by the immigration court. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well --

MR. McCLOUD: I also want to emphasize 

that --

let me -- let me -- let me pause there.  Your 

regulations are interesting because they -- they 

suggest that a lot of things are required in a

government finds inconvenient, like the hearing 

date, and try to resuscitate the pre-statutory 

regime that existed before where the government

So the regulations themselves may or 

may not comply with the statute and they -- as 

Justice Barrett pointed out, they may or may not

 change.

 The only statutory hook I think you've

 identified to -- to save the problem is the

 clear and convincing evidence requirement, but 

that's just a clear and convincing evidence 

requirement that the notice was given. 

And, here, the notice would be the 

Section 2 notice, the notice of change.  So none 

of that means that the NTA, the Section 1 

notice, has to be complete or, in fact, anything 

other than a blank document, right? 

MR. McCLOUD: So, Justice Gorsuch, I 

think, if we were in the world where we had 

repealed our -- all our regulations and we have

 it is a "trust us" argument.  Trust us. We will 

-- we will have all our own internal operating

 procedures.

 I'm asking you about statutory

 interpretation.  And we normally ask -- we think 

statutes are coherent, sensible, not ridiculous.

 You -- you invoked common sense in your opening

 argument. 

And, here, one consequence of your 

argument, I think, is that the NTA can be a 

blank document and that you can remove someone 

in absentia based on a notice of change that 

says show up on a date certain. 

Nobody -- the immigrant may or may not 

know that this is really the government.  It's 

just a date to show up in some place.  It 

doesn't have notice of charges or lawyers 

against him. 

And the government wins, right? 

MR. McCLOUD: So, Just -- Justice 

Gorsuch, I have several responses to that 

question.  The first is this is not a case where 

we are simply asking you to trust us. This is a 

statute that has been on the books for nearly 30

 thousands of times.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Am -- am I correct 

that the clear and convincing evidence rule that 

you're relying on as a matter of statutory 

interpretation would allow the government to 

remove somebody for a blank document, NTA, if 

they failed to appear on a notice of change, the 

government can prove by clear and convincing 

evidence it issued a compliant notice of change? 

MR. McCLOUD: Our position is that if 

a non-citizen receives a paragraph (2) notice, a 

notice of hearing saying show up at immigration 

proceedings at this date and this time, then, 

yes, the non-citizen needs to comply with that. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. 

MR. McCLOUD: And if the non-citizen 

doesn't attend, they could be removed.

MR. McCLOUD: That's very far away 

from the facts of these cases.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- if -- if that

 happens -- if that happens, if that's the 

consequence of your statutory interpretation, we 

have to ask whether that fits with common sense,

 you say.  Okay.

 One common-sense consequence might be

 this: That if the government can issue blank 

notices to appear, which it has found rather 

inconvenient in the past to -- to -- to comply 

with that provision, need only file notice of 

changes and then remove people who fail to show 

up, why wouldn't it proceed in exactly that 

fashion going forward as a consequence of a 

decision in the government's favor in this case 

when, as I understand it, and my figures may not 

be exact, about a third of cases in immigration 

proceedings are in absentia removals, so 

failures to appear. 

So why not issue a blank NTA because 

they're hard -- they're -- they're a pain, we've 

found them difficult, then issue an -- a 

compliant notice of change, show up on a date 

certain, and then remove about a third of the

 appear is inadequate that doesn't have the time

 and place.  Despite that, and despite the fact 

that there's ample proof that it can be done, it 

hasn't been done. It continues to issue these 

TBA notices to appear.

 If we rule in your favor, we're giving 

you an incentive to continue that practice, 

because you can do it continuously.  You don't 

have to pay any attention to the statute.  You 

can continue doing TBAs and continue your 

practice.  As Justice Gorsuch said, those people 

who show up, you give them a compliant one when 

they show up.  Those people who don't, you 

remove them in absentia, and they can't ever 

come back and complain about your process. 

That's really the incentive here. 

MR. McCLOUD: So, Justice Sotomayor, I 

have two responses to that. 

First, I want to talk a little bit 

about our current practices.  We have made very 

significant progress in the years since Pereira 

and Niz-Chavez in reducing the number of TBD 

NTAs that are still issued.  There are

 technological and operational reasons why we're

 not down to zero yet, and I'm happy to talk

 about those if Your Honor is interested.  But I 

do want to assure the Court that we take very

 seriously the obligation to comply with this 

Court's decisions and to comply with the

 statute.

 The -- the bigger problem is, assuming 

we could issue NTAs that had time and date 

information going forward, it does not do 

anything about the hundreds of thousands of 

cases that have already been closed where 

removal orders were already issued --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's go to the 

practical problems.  You started by saying 

there's an entitlement to reopen.  There isn't. 

It is the right to make a motion to reopen, but 

it's still discretionary for the BIA to decide 

whether to reopen.  Is that correct? 

MR. McCLOUD: So that is the way that 

we read the statute.  That's not the way that 

some courts, in particular the Ninth Circuit, 

have read the statute.  They have suggested that 

if a non-citizen files a motion and they can 

prove that they -- they got the defective NTA --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's a

 separate legal issue.  The way the statute is

 risen -- written, it is not mandatory to reopen.

 It -- there -- they can take into account what 

happened in one of these three cases where a --

a litigant showed up. And I don't know, did you

 forfeit that argument in -- was that the last

 case that's before us, the Mendez-Colín case?

 MR. McCLOUD: In the Mendez-Colín 

argument? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  He showed up 

a number of times and then left, correct? 

MR. McCLOUD: That is correct, and we 

did not make a specific waiver or forfeiture 

argument if that's what Your Honor is referring 

to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That --

MR. McCLOUD: We've highlighted the 

facts of his case for two reasons.  The first is 

because it shows --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?

 MR. McCLOUD: -- the other side's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If -- if you had 

raised that argument, do you have any doubt the 

BIA would have said you forfeited because you 

had notice of these proceedings and your rights 

and the time and place?

 MR. McCLOUD: So there are two 

problems with relying on waiver or forfeiture in 

this context.  The first is it still allows 

these motions to be filed.  And if even some 

significant fraction of the hundreds of 

thousands of old in absentia orders are injected 

back into the immigration system, that could 

have a very significant impact on a system that 

is already dealing with a backlog of 3 million 

cases. 

The second problem is that waiver or 

forfeiture actually heightens the perverse 

incentives that the non-citizens rule creates. 

Mendez-Colín would have been better off just 

never showing up.  And so their rule creates a 

circumstance where non-citizens are encouraged 

to flout the rules of the removal process by

 MR. McCLOUD: And -- and that's our

can't sort of ask us to read the statute against

 absentia removal when a non-citizen received

 notice either -- under either paragraph (1) or

 paragraph (2).  And all the non-citizens here

 got the paragraph (2) notice.  They haven't 

contested that they received notice of when and

 where to show up.

most fundamentally I find a little bit 

discomfiting about your argument, this idea that 

there are two forms of notice, take your pick. 

If one is good, who cares about the other. 

I mean, it seems to me that if you 

read the statute fairly, it's quite clearly --

and -- and this is what we said in our two prior 

cases -- you know, (a)(1) is the notice.  That's 

the notice.  And what (a)(2) -- it tells you 

what you have to put in it, all the things that 

you have to do.  Here are the charges. Here is 

your right to counsel.  And here is when you're 

supposed to show up. 

And what (a)(2) is about is Congress 

understood that there were going to be times 

when you were told to show up on March 15th and 

then it turned out that March 15th was

of reasons, and it was a mechanism to say, okay,

 we don't mean March 15th; instead, show up on

 August 15th.

 notice that you can say, hey, look, we did that

 one.

 procedure of removing them without a hearing.

 So I guess I'm a little concerned that 

what you're suggesting is that we should presume

 that the -- that the removal is proper, the

 removal order is proper, even if the notice was 

defective, and now it's on the non-citizen to 

say something or it shifts to his burden to 

prove, you know, that he should not be removed 

under those circumstances. 

MR. McCLOUD: A -- a couple of 

responses, Your Honor. 

First, we are not asking you to read 

out of the statute the -- the paragraph (2) 

notice or to ignore the paragraph (1) notice. 

We're saying both of those notices are relevant 

for purposes of in absentia removal.  And we 

bear the burden as the government of proving 

that the non-citizen got notice. But that 

notice can be in the form of the paragraph (1) 

notice or the paragraph (2) notice. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But how do you 

square that with the -- the prior cases?  I 

don't understand your distinction.  It -- maybe 

I would understand it if we hadn't already

looked at this same circumstance to determine

 whether a notice is defective and what is the

 consequence of that.

 So, in Pereira, we said, if it doesn't 

have the time or place, the notice to appear,

 then it's defective.  And as I read Niz-Chavez, 

we say the government can't cure that deficiency 

for the purpose of the stop-gap -- stop-time 

rule by providing a paragraph (2) notice. 

So the government, I think, has to say 

there's something different about this scenario, 

the removal scenario in -- in absentia, than the 

top -- the stop-time rule scenario. 

MR. McCLOUD: And there are two 

significant differences, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay. 

MR. McCLOUD: One is textual and one 

is based on -- on legislative history and 

drafting. 

So the textual difference is that for 

purposes of the stop-time rule, the only notice 

that is relevant is the notice to appear. That 

is the only notice that is referred to in that 

provision. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Why -- why do you

say that?  I'm sorry.

 MR. McCLOUD: Because, when you look 

at the text of the stop-time rule --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah.

 MR. McCLOUD: -- it says it is

 triggered based on the service of a notice to 

appear. There is no reference to the notice of

 hearing.

 JUSTICE JACKSON: But it says a notice 

to appear under Section 1229(a) of this title, 

and the notice of hearing is under Section 20 --

1229(a) of this title as well, right? 

MR. McCLOUD: Well, Your Honor, that's 

the argument we made in Pereira that the Court 

rejected.  The Court said that for purposes of 

that provision, only the notice to appear is 

relevant.  So, even though it refers generally 

to 1229, the notice to appear is the only notice 

that's being referred there -- to there. 

And that is very different textually 

from the in absentia removal provision, which 

refers to notice under either paragraph (1) or 

paragraph (2).  And so --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What's the 

legislative history reason?

MR. McCLOUD: The legislative history 

reason is that Congress clearly, when it was

 adopting these provisions, the in absentia

 removal provisions, wanted to cut down on 

procedural gamesmanship and the abuse of

 loopholes by non-citizens that could be used to

 avoid removal.  So it makes sense that Congress

 would want to be expansive in in absentia 

removal in a way it wouldn't necessarily have 

wanted to do for purposes of stop time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

Justice Thomas? 

Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think 

would happen if the government proceeded along 

the lines that Justice Gorsuch has outlined? 

MR. McCLOUD: I think we would create 

a mess for ourselves because we would not have 

any proceedings in which to remove non-citizens. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would that be subject 

to challenge under any provision of federal law? 

MR. McCLOUD: Yes.  It would be 

subject to challenge under our own regulations. 

I assume that non-citizens would challenge it

fact that this has never happened in more than 

500,000 in absentia removals is proof that we 

have no incentive whatsoever to do that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Would aliens have an 

incentive to challenge that as a due process

 violation?

 MR. McCLOUD: They could.  We haven't

 taken a position on the due process issue, but I 

think that's a viable argument that they could 

at least raise.

any of the supposed safeguards that you've

you know, non-citizens don't have the right to

the right to be informed that they could obtain 

counsel.

MR. McCLOUD: If a non-citizen is --

to put that information into the notice to

 appear, I would still say that that notice to 

appear can validly be used to start the removal

 proceeding, but the non-citizen, if they come to 

the hearing, as they should, can say, I was

 never informed of the right to counsel and, 

therefore, I shouldn't have been -- you know, I

 should get that opportunity.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Not that we have to 

start all over again?  That's and -- I mean, 

what law would -- would the non-citizen at that 

point invoke under -- under your theory of the 

statute? 

MR. McCLOUD: So the regulations and 

the statute have been interpreted as a claim 

processing rule. If we don't comply with all of 

the requirements of the claim processing rule, 

there are questions about exactly what the 

remedy is. Some courts have said the remedy is 

a new proceeding.  Some courts have said that 

the remedy is that the government gives an 

opportunity to cure. 

So, in your scenario, I think the 

remedy would be that we give the non-citizen 

time to obtain counsel and we inform them of

ask you about the provision in the in absentia

 removal statute that says that you can remove

 somebody if they've -- an alien if -- if he has

 failed to supply his address.

 Doesn't that fairly suggest that the

 alien has first received a compliant notice to 

appear telling him, as the statute requires, 

that he must supply his address? 

MR. McCLOUD: Yes, Your Honor, and 

that's what the Board held in the In re G-Y-R-

said, if you never received a notice that 

informed you of that requirement, you can't be 

ordered in absentia --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I understand 

that's your response, that, oh, don't worry. 

Okay? 

But I think the logic of your argument 

is, if he fails to appear for a notice of change 

hearing, he -- your -- and -- and the notice of 

change statement notice was itself compliant, 

forget about the NTA, you're good to go in 

absentia removal.  That's -- that's the --

saying: Well, not with respect to addresses if 

the NTA didn't ask him for his address. But 

where in the statute does that come from?

 When I look at the in absentia removal

 provision as you read it, if I'm to take your

 logic seriously, that's irrelevant.  Now it's 

nice that you have a Board decision and -- and 

-- or a regulation, but I'm again asking you as 

a matter of statutory interpretation how that 

argument hangs together. 

MR. McCLOUD: And the answer as a 

matter of statutory interpretation is that if 

you look at 1229(b)(B), it refers to --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  1229? 

MR. McCLOUD: (b)(B). 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  (b). 

MR. McCLOUD: Little b, big B. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Little b, big B, 

okay. 

MR. McCLOUD: It says that no written 

notice shall be required under subparagraph (a) 

if the alien has failed to provide the address

 Kavanaugh?

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think you were

 interrupted when you were saying correcting the 

NTAs going forward doesn't do anything about the

 hundreds of thousands who previously received

 NTAs without the time and date, so can you just

 finish your answer on that?  Like, what will 

happen to those hundreds of thousands of cases?

 MR. McCLOUD: Certainly, Justice 

Kavanaugh.  So, as the Ninth Circuit has 

interpreted this provision, all of those 

hundreds of thousands of individuals have a 

right to seek rescission.  And as I was 

discussing with some members of the Court 

earlier, at least in the Ninth Circuit and some 

other courts, that right is essentially 

automatic. 

And so we are very concerned that 

those hundreds of thousands of cases could be 

injected back into the immigration system.  And 

we have already seen some evidence of that in 

the wake of the Ninth Circuit's panel decision 

in Singh.  So, in 2021, the year prior to the 

Singh panel decision, there were 380 motions to 

rescind in absentia orders filed nationwide.  In

2022, the year of the Singh decision, that had

 risen to over 6,000.  And in 2023, that had

 risen to over 11,000.

 So I think, if this Court sides with 

the Ninth Circuit, that already substantial 

increase we have seen is going to turn into an

 avalanche.

           JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And then how do we

 think about the context of the stop-time rule 

versus the context of in absentia removal in 

thinking about the particular statutory 

provisions here, or is that the different 

context not relevant? 

MR. McCLOUD: No, I think it is 

relevant in this respect, Your Honor.  So one of 

the concerns that the petitioner in Pereira 

brought and that I think the Court latched onto 

in Pereira was that the stop-time rule gives the 

government a procedural advantage, and there was 

a sense that it was unfair to allow the 

government that procedural advantage if it had 

never committed to moving forward with removal 

proceedings in the first place. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  What's the 

procedural advantage?  Just spell that out.

MR. McCLOUD: The procedural advantage 

is that the non-citizen does not accrue years

 toward cancellation of removal.  And so it makes

 it easier for the government to remove someone

 if we can trigger the stop-time rule.  So there

 was a sense of -- of unfairness, I think, or at 

least an allegation of unfairness there.

 That's very different from this

 context.  In the in absentia removal context, 

the unfairness, I think, would come from giving 

non-citizens who knew they were in removal 

proceedings and who knew they had an obligation 

to go to their hearings and who knew when and 

where the hearings were the chance to claim a 

lack of notice when they clearly had notice. 

And that disadvantages other 

non-citizens who did follow the rules, who 

complied and went to their removal proceedings, 

because those non-citizens could be removed at 

the end of their proceedings, but someone like 

Mendez-Colín, who just decides, I don't want to 

show up, has this in absentia order, but it 

could always be rescinded under the Ninth 

Circuit's rule.

absentia removal proceeding part of the statute, 

it says you have to show by clearing and --

 clear and convincing evidence that the written 

notice was provided and by clear and convincing

 evidence that the non-citizen is removable.

 MR. McCLOUD: Correct.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So a big

 concern and I think the -- the worst part for 

you is this blank document hypothetical or 

hypothetical that omits crucial information like 

the right to counsel or the grounds for removal. 

What would the IJ do -- and -- and I'm 

going to toe -- the Justice Gorsuch line here --

don't refer me to the regulations.  As a matter 

of the statutory language, for purposes of 

determining whether the non-citizen by clear and 

convincing evidence is removable, is it possible 

if only the notice of hearing has been provided 

for the IJ to make that determination? 

I mean, I guess, according to the 

statute, the government could simply say and 

launch into a whole new explanation that wasn't 

included in any NTA about why the alien or the 

non-citizen is removable.

answer is it is not possible because 

removability requires an assessment of the

 charges against the non-citizen. So, if all the 

IJ had was the notice of hearing that says this 

is the time for the proceeding and the 

consequences for not attending --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But the charging

than the NTA.

where the government has supplemented the 

charges against the non-citizen I guess orally 

or they've appended them to the notice of 

hearing, I suppose the immigration judge could 

look at that document and decide that it 

complies --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  We're imagining the 

world of the worst-case hypothetical where it's 

a blank document for the NTA and then the notice 

of hearing that tells the non-citizen where and 

when to show up and the nightmare hypothetical 

that then the non-citizen can be ordered 

removable when he was never informed what the 

charges against him were, the grounds of

 MR. McCLOUD: And I guess where I'm

 struggling in the hypothetical is with the idea

 that the -- the immigration judge would even be 

able to say that the non-citizen is removable if

 there are no charges.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, that's my 

question too, so that's why I asked you what the 

distinction between the NTA and whatever 

document is necessary to initiate the removal 

proceeding is, because it seems to me that if 

they are distinct documents and they are 

different, the nightmare scenario can unfold 

with the safeguard of the regulations. 

MR. McCLOUD: Maybe I was unclear in 

my -- my answer --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay. 

MR. McCLOUD: -- to your first 

question.  For purposes of removal, the charging 

document is the notice to appear.  That's why 

the notice to appear has to contain the charges 

in order for it to be a notice to appear that 

starts a removal proceeding. 

So, in the blank document 

hypothetical, where there's no charges

 told Justice Gorsuch -- he -- he said all you

 need to show by clear and convincing evidence is

MR. McCLOUD: I -- I may have

question that I was asked by Justice Gorsuch was 

assume away all of those protections in the 

regulation and assume away the fact that the 

notice has to contain the charges, what result 

then? And I -- I think the answer then is the 

notice of hearing alone would be sufficient, but 

that's just a million miles away from the 

reality of this statutory scheme --

answer is that the non-citizen cannot be found 

removable unless the government shows by clear 

and convincing evidence that the notice was 

provided and that he is removable, and you're

dot all the I's and -- and cross all the T's

 with respect to that.

 But I guess I see this as exactly --

"this" meaning in absentia removal -- as exactly 

the same thing, because, ordinarily, a

 non-citizen would be entitled to a hearing where

 he or she could make an argument and advocate 

for themselves about removal, and the statute 

allows the government to get around that in a 

sense by allowing the -- the government to get a 

removal order in the absence of adversarial 

presentation by the person who doesn't show up. 

And so I guess what I'm trying --

still struggling with is why we would have a 

world in which a statute that requires the 

government to give notice in order to be able to 

get a removal in absentia order would allow for 

that notice to be deficient in any way. 

Justice Barrett talked about the 

different ways in which it might be deficient, 

but why -- why could the government give 

deficient notice in order to get the benefit of 

in absentia removal when we've already held that 

the government can't give deficient notice to 

get the benefit of the stop-time rule?

MR. McCLOUD: I have a couple of

 responses to that, Justice Jackson.

 The first is we agree that

 non-citizens get the opportunity to present

 their case in the way that Your Honor suggested, 

and they get that opportunity by showing up at 

the hearing. So the facts of these cases are we

 told the non-citizens when and where to show up 

to present their case and they failed to do 

that. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, but the 

statute --

MR. McCLOUD: That still leaves --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- the statute 

doesn't say, if the non-citizen doesn't show up, 

the government gets the removal order.  The 

statute says, if the non-citizen doesn't show up 

and the government proves that through clear and 

convincing evidence they got notice and the 

person is removable, then the government gets 

the order. 

So I don't think the government can 

rely on the fact that the person didn't show up 

as the basis for the validity of their removal 

order. And my question remains, if the

 order under our prior precedents?

 MR. McCLOUD: And -- and I think my

removal, there are two notices that are relevant 

and can be a basis for in absentia removal, and

saying that the notice isn't deficient.  I -- if 

-- let's assume that the notice is deficient. 

My question is, if the notice is deficient, 

you're suggesting that there's something about 

removal that would make it okay for the 

government to still get the order in that 

situation, when we've said, if a notice is 

deficient in the stop-time rule scenario, that 

the government can't stop the time.

said that it was a narrow decision about the

non-citizen gets absolutely no notice 

whatsoever, they can be ordered removed in 

absentia.  In these cases, it is true that the 

notice to appear lacked certain information, but

notices of hearing that the non-citizens 

received.

they can be found removable.  So I didn't mean

 cases is the non-citizens just didn't finish out

 the process.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And,

 finally, with respect to the catastrophic nature 

of a ruling in the favor of the other side, you

 said that the Ninth Circuit finds that there's

 automatic reopening and whatnot. 

So couldn't we agree with the Ninth 

Circuit's holding related to the deficiency of 

the notice here but maybe disagree that there's 

automatic reopening for all the people who have 

previously had this problem? 

MR. McCLOUD: So I -- I guess what I 

would say is the question of what is the remedy 

and whether it's automatic or not is not before 

you. I don't think it's fairly included as part 

of the question presented, but --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But if we were to --

true, true.  But what I'm just saying is it's --

it's not necessarily the case that we would have 

this catastrophic result because we could have a 

separate remedy question that we could disagree 

with the Ninth Circuit.

you could have a later remedy case, but I would

 still caution that even if it's not automatic, a 

significant number of these motions are likely

 to be granted because the non-citizens are

 saying we did not get notice.  And so, if they 

are granted and if they are injected back into 

the immigration system, that is going to have 

significant impacts on that system.

reject the government's argument here.

 Indeed, the government's position in 

these cases is more extreme than its position in

 Niz-Chavez.  In Niz-Chavez, the government said, 

so long as the government -- so long as the

 non-citizen gets all of the information listed 

in paragraph (1), it doesn't matter what format

 it comes in.

 In these cases, the government seems 

to be arguing that if you have a paragraph (2) 

notice, it does not matter if the non-citizen 

never gets any of the information in paragraph 

(1). And just to slightly amend the kind of 

nightmare hypothetical we're talking about, it's 

where the government sends the non-citizen a 

blank piece of paper but nonetheless gives the 

immigration judge information about, for 

instance, the charges against the non-citizen. 

In that circumstance, the government 

can prove by clear and convincing evidence 

removability, the non-citizen has no clue what 

the charges against him are. 

And where, as in Niz-Chavez, the 

argument was that a deficient NTA was 

nonetheless sufficient to stop the clock for

 discretionary relief, here, the government is 

arguing that same deficient NTA is somehow 

sufficient for the far more draconian sanction

 of removing a non-citizen without ever hearing

 their side of the story. 

Because the statute doesn't 

contemplate that result, because it requires a 

complete valid paragraph (1) notice in every

 case, and contemplates a paragraph (2) notice 

only as a supplement to that valid paragraph (1) 

notice, this Court should reject the 

government's arguments again. 

I welcome this Court's questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What's your best 

textual argument for your last point? 

MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, we think 

that there's two buckets of textual evidence. 

The first is about the sort of centrality of the 

NTA. So it's the fact that it shall be issued 

in every removal proceeding, the fact that it 

contains a bunch of information that's not in 

paragraph (2), and the fact that the statute 

says that a hearing can't be held less than 10 

days from the NTA.  So there's a presumption of 

the NTA.

The second bucket is the language of 

1229 paragraph (2), which says that a -- a

 notice of change must be given only in the case 

of a change in the time and place of the

 proceeding.  And we believe that the -- the 

combination of those two, the centrality of the 

NTA, the change language that this Court has 

already interpreted in Pereira, adds up to our

 position. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I think it says "any 

change," and that "any change" language seems to 

be broad enough for the change here. 

MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, again, 

that "any change" language is -- is the same 

language that was interpreted in Pereira, and I 

don't think it's broad enough to encompass what 

happened here. 

If I could take the example from the 

government's reply brief of the voter 

registration form and the change of party 

affiliation form, if you mess up your voter 

registration form, if it's invalid in the same 

way here the NTAs were invalid, it doesn't 

matter how many change of party affiliation 

forms you file.  Until you fix that voter

 any good. 

The same thing is true here. Because 

the NTA initially was invalid because it had the 

TBD language, it doesn't matter how many times

 you say, I'm trying to change that.  Until 

you've got the valid NTA, there's no change to

 be had.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I just have a 

clarification of your position, Ms. Anand? 

Suppose that you have a -- a 

non-citizen has a paragraph (1) notice and 

there's nothing wrong with the date and time. 

So the government fills out the date and time 

correctly, but it does something else wrong.  It 

doesn't tell the non-citizen about the charges, 

or it doesn't tell the non-citizen about the 

right to counsel or so forth.  And then there's 

a paragraph (2) notice because there needs to be 

a change in the date or time. 

Now, at that point, what happens?  Is 

-- is -- is -- could the non-citizen reopen? 

MS. ANAND: So no, Your Honor, and 

that's sort of for the reason I just 

articulated.  So we think that in this case, the

there's never been a time and place of the 

proceeding set, because the NTA is invalid, 

right, it's not doing its function of initiating 

a proceeding, then there can't be a change to 

the time and place.

the first notice with the time and date.  So, 

you know, you don't get the textual hook of 

saying, oh, that's not a change because it 

hasn't gone from to be determined to March 15th. 

It's gone from February 15th to March 15th.

 But there's some other problem. 

There's some other problem about the charges or

 about the right to counsel.  It seems to me that 

you've now lost your textual hook for the 

non-citizen to be able to say that they have a 

right to reopen.

invalid, right, you never actually registered to 

vote, you can't just file -- fill out a change 

of party affiliation form even if you had a 

party listed in the registration form. 

And that the same thing is true here. 

The NTA is invalid if it's missing some of the 

information in paragraph (1).  And so it's not 

actually doing any work.

But you would just say there's simply 

no NTA, and so it isn't something that's 

remedied by Section 2, which has to do with time 

and place information.  You just need to file a 

compliant NTA and then off you go.  Is that --

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right. 

Now, again, in this case, it's overdetermined

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you dispute the 

proposition that just as a matter of ordinary 

language, there can be a change from an 

indeterminate time or place to a determinate

 time or place?

 MS. ANAND: So, yes, Your Honor, we 

think that ordinary speakers of English don't

 use "change" to refer to indeterminate time to 

determinate time. So we give the example of a 

bride who announces she's going to get married. 

We don't know the date yet.  When she sends out 

her cards telling you the date, we call that a 

Save the Date, not a Change the Date, for 

instance. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I mean, if the 

-- the bride says, I'm going to get married, and 

a friend says, oh, when is that going to happen, 

and the bride says, well, we don't know yet, 

then the other person says, well, let me know if 

there's any change, do you think that's an 

unusual use of language? 

MS. ANAND: So I do, Your Honor, and I 

think that's particularly so in this case 

because of the kind of validity point I've been 

making. So that is to say when in the -- when

the initial document is invalid --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no, I'm not

 talking about the -- the intricacies of this

 statute.  I'm just talking about ordinary

 language.  I could give you many examples of 

exactly the same thing. It doesn't seem to me 

-- you -- you have an interpretation of change, 

but do you really want to say that this is 

outside of the realm of -- reasonable realm of 

possibility that people can talk about a change 

in that way? 

MS. ANAND: So I don't know if it's 

outside of the reasonable realm, but when 

combined with the language from Pereira, sort of 

not quite holding but clearly sort of central to 

the discussion is this interpretation of the 

exact same language, and when combined with the 

other structural clues that an NTA is central to 

the whole administration of this statute, I 

think our interpretation of "change" is the 

better one. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  How do you respond 

to the government's suggestion that the NTA is 

really not central?  I mean, the government says 

we -- we are looking at the statute and it says,

you know, we can get an in absentia removal 

order if we have issued (1) or (2).

 And so I guess the government's point 

is that suggests that (1) is really not pivotal 

in the way that you are putting forward.

 MS. ANAND: So I think that's wrong,

 Your Honor, for two reasons. 

The first is that the "or" in the in 

absentia context doesn't define the relationship 

between (a)(1) and (a)(2).  That's done in the 

statute defining those two provisions. 

And so, again, to go back to the voter 

registration hypothetical, you could have a 

sentence saying, you know, send the voter the 

primary ballot for the party listed in their 

voter registration form or their change of party 

affiliation form.  That wouldn't mean that 

somehow the voter registration form is 

irrelevant just because you have the word "or" 

in that sentence. 

And so I think what you have to do is 

look at paragraphs (1) and (2) and the 

relationship between them, and it's clear both 

from the mandatory language of paragraph (1), 

from the fact that, as this Court explained in

 Niz-Chavez, it's the one place that tells you 

all the information you need to defend yourself 

at a removal proceeding, and the fact that

 (a)(2) is structured as a change or a 

supplement, that those two documents are not

 interchangeable.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Ms. Anand, let -- I 

-- I want to make sure I understand your answer 

to Justice Kagan about change. So you're saying 

that, you know, just because you file a change 

of party affiliation form doesn't make your 

initial voter registration valid.  I -- I -- I 

get that. 

But, in the statute, it says, "change 

of time or place of proceedings." So it's not, 

you know, referring generally.  I'm just 

wondering where you get the statutory hook, 

because that presumes that there is an NTA. 

But, if it's defective in some way, if, as 

Justice Kagan said, we take the defect in time 

and place out of it, why couldn't it be that 

there is an NTA that's defective in some way, 

but the statute imposes an obligation on the 

non-citizen who knows the time and place he's 

supposed to show up to make an appearance at

that proceeding and raise whatever objection

 there is to the defect?

 MS. ANAND: So --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  And -- and maybe --

 maybe the objection -- and I'm thinking of 

analogy to a Rule 55 civil, you know, default

 judgment proceeding.

 It may well be that whatever objection

 that the non-citizen raises at that point is 

fatal to the government's case.  You know, maybe 

it's missing some vital piece of information. 

Maybe it can be remedied if it's omitted the 

right to counsel by giving him time to obtain 

counsel.  If there's some problem in the 

description of the charges, the grounds for 

removal, then maybe the entire thing has to be 

dismissed and the government has to start again. 

But why wouldn't it be consistent with 

the statutory scheme for the non-citizen to have 

to show up to the removal proceeding and 

register whatever objection the non-citizen has? 

I'm not saying that that's right, but it seems 

to me -- I -- I just want to understand why 

that's ruled out on your understanding of the 

statutory language.

MS. ANAND: Sure, Your Honor.  So the

 statute doesn't ask about notice generally or

 notice of the time of the hearing.  It asks

 about notice in accordance with the specific

 statutory provisions. 

And that's a contrast to the pre- --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Or, though, right?

 MS. ANAND: So that's correct.  But 

our position is that there's been neither a 

paragraph (1) notice nor a paragraph (2) notice. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  But I guess I don't 

understand why -- where in the statute you can 

say there has not been a paragraph (1) notice if 

there's been a defective paragraph (1) notice? 

There's been a paragraph (1) notice.  And, here, 

I'm not talking about the blank piece of paper. 

I'm just saying it's missing some piece of 

information other than date and time. 

Why isn't that just a defective NTA? 

MS. ANAND: So I think that's sort of 

the square holding of Pereira.  So, again, 

Pereira reserved the question of missing other 

pieces of information, but the statute puts them 

all on par.  And Pereira says it's not just that 

this is a deficient document.  It says no notice

I -- I'm not cutting you off? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  No, I'm done. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- then I'll 

jump into that.  I have -- I want to follow up 

on Justice Barrett's question because she seems 

to be seeing a difference between a 

jurisdictional flaw and a claim processing flaw, 

which is what Mr. McCloud has been calling this. 

And I do think that we -- you have to 

address that question.  It seems to me that the 

clear holding of our precedent -- prior 

precedents is that it's jurisdictional, that if 

you don't have a proper notice of appeal -- of 

-- of appearance, that that's a jurisdictional 

defect.  They can't order you -- they can't

order you removed until they provide you with 

the proper document, correct?

 MS. ANAND: So I think that's right. 

I want to be a little bit careful because I

 think "jurisdictional" is a little bit of a

 slippery word.

           JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It is.

 MS. ANAND: So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the 

problem. 

MS. ANAND: Right.  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- but so is 

using claim processing in this kind of context. 

MS. ANAND: So our position is that if 

you show up at the hearing, as Justice Barrett 

articulated, you can say this was defective. 

And until the government cures that defect, they 

can't go forward.  Congress also provided an 

express remedy for where there's a defective 

notice and you're removed in absentia. 

There is no remedy in the statute for 

where there's a defective notice and a removal 

order was entered after a hearing.  So we're not 

saying that someone who attended their hearing,

many cases and many years.

 The second is, you know, I -- I -- I

 don't want to dispute that there will be an 

increase in the volume of these motions, but I 

do want to be clear about who exactly has an 

incentive to file them. Remember, if you win on 

reopening your in absentia removal order, all 

you get is another hearing, right, even if 

you're successful in clearing all the hurdles. 

And at that hearing, you have to prove that 

you're able to remain in the U.S. 

And so, you know, for many, many 

non-citizens who have no pathway to staying in 

the United States, it's very unlikely that 

they're going to come forward and file one of 

these motions to reopen because the best they 

get is another hearing. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, counsel, 

did I understand you to say that if an -- I 

mean, we've heard a lot of talk about 

deficiencies in -- apart from the -- the notice 

and that being one of the problems, but we --

 It -- it -- is it a harmless error 

situation if there have been no changes in the 

rest of the NTA?

 MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, I think 

that the statute doesn't contemplate that, 

right? The statute asks not just for notice or

 notice of the information listed in paragraph 

(1) but notice in accordance with these 

provisions. 

And prior to 1990, remember the scheme 

was this sort of case-by-case adjudication.  So 

the statute said "notice reasonable under the 

circumstances."  And what Congress did was it 

said, rather than that kind of case-by-case 

adjudication, did the non-citizen get enough 

notice, we're going to put the cards in the 

government's hand. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but 

let's just say that there has been no change in 

the notice.  I suppose, if you want to challenge 

the notice as a categorical matter across the 

board of all these proceedings, you could. 

But I thought you said that if there 

has been no change, in other words, other than a

of the NTA is -- is the same, that that

 individual would have no -- no claim at that

 point.

 MS. ANAND: So, just so I understand

 the hypothetical, the -- the -- the notice to

 appear is compliant?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except for,

 you know, the reason that -- the reason there is 

a later, a new notice, that's the only situation 

in which it is -- the only aspect in which it's 

non-compliant. 

MS. ANAND: So --

MS. ANAND: The person shows up at the 

time, so they have a non-compliant -- they have 

a TBD NTA that the -- right? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. 

MS. ANAND: So I think, at that point, 

they can say -- you know, they won't get much 

for it, but they can certainly say you can't 

proceed until you give me a compliant NTA.  The 

government has to print out a new one.

they just said here's the -- the -- the NTA was 

compliant in every respect except that we had a 

TBA rather than the actual time and place. You 

got notice of the time and place. You showed

 up. What?

 MS. ANAND: You show up and you say my

 NTA was not compliant.  The government has to 

give you a new one. It has to wait 10 days

 before they can remove you.  Now it's the same 

thing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was not 

compliant in that it didn't have a time and 

place. But then it was.  There was a time and 

place. And you say he has to show up and say, I 

didn't get a time and place in the original one; 

even though I got a time and place in the second 

one and showed up, I can complain that I didn't 

get one in the original one? 

MS. ANAND: So I think that's the 

square holding of Niz-Chavez.  Niz-Chavez says 

two different documents that add up to all the 

notice requirements under paragraph (1) is still 

not a paragraph (1) notice.  That's the holding 

of Niz-Chavez.

 position is even more extreme because they're 

telling you it doesn't even matter if the

 non-citizen never got all of the notice in

 paragraph (1).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, I know 

that's what they're telling us, but I'm 

addressing a case which I -- I would suppose

 would be a very common one where there's no

 objection other than that I didn't get the time 

and notice in the first place.  There's been a 

lot of talk, well, they don't tell you there's 

a right to counsel, they don't tell you this or 

that. What if they told you all that in the 

original one that you got, but it didn't have a 

time and place; then they come back and say, 

well, here's the time and place, you show up, 

and they say, well, what's -- what's your 

objection, and you say that the objection is 

that I didn't get the time and place originally, 

even though I got it later and here I am? 

MS. ANAND: So I think that's right. 

I think that's the -- the sort of square holding 

of Niz-Chavez. It says that those two documents 

don't add up to a paragraph (1) notice.  I'll

answer to the Chief Justice makes it clear, I 

think, but correct me if I'm wrong, that you

 would be better off not showing up.

 MS. ANAND: I don't think so, Your 

Honor, because remember, if you don't show up, 

all the government has to do at that point is 

say, oh, that's right, I didn't have a proper 

NTA. Here -- here's, I'm printing it out, I'm 

mailing it to the non-citizen with the time and 

place. Ten days later I can remove you in 

absentia. 

So either way, all you're buying 

yourself is the government reprinting this piece 

of paper and waiting 10 days to remove you. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But -- but the 

removal --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I under --

will be -- can't happen under your theory.

the NTA, again, fills in the time and date and

 then waits 10 days. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: They start the

 proceedings over again --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But the removal in 

absentia can't happen if the person shows up,

 right? I mean, the -- the reason why we're in 

absentia world is because they don't show up. 

So I guess I'm confused about the Chief 

Justice's hypothetical and how it relates to 

this statute or this circumstance that we're 

talking about. 

I thought the -- I thought the -- the 

-- the sort of premise of where we were was 

we're in a situation in which the person isn't 

there and the government gets removal in 

absentia as a result. 

MS. ANAND: And that's exactly right. 

I was just trying to clarify that I don't know 

how much of this -- sort of bizarre incentives 

point. First of all, of course, the government 

can just issue a compliant NTA upfront. If they 

haven't and the non-citizen doesn't show up, 

they can send ICE out to arrest the person.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I 

thought the proposition that I was simply trying

 to suggest that your argument leads to an absurd 

result if what it says is that everything's the 

same, except you didn't get the notice 

originally and the fact that you got a later 

notice, you're saying your argument would still 

be the same. 

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor. I think that's a function of the 

government flouting the statute, though, right? 

The statute was not actually designed for a 

situation in which the government systematically 

puts TBD instead of the -- the sort of date and 

time of the charges.  It was designed for the 

kind of one-off mistake, you put the wrong 

person's name on this or sent this to the wrong 

address.

 MS. ANAND: Yes, Your Honor.  Congress 

expressly said at any time, in contrast to

 numerous other provisions of allowing --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, that -- I

 think there's a difference between the right to 

make a motion to reopen than to have it

 reopened.

 Are you arguing that if there was a 

deficient notice in this situation under (a)(1), 

that the Board has to reopen, or does it have 

the discretion to consider a forfeiture or a 

waiver argument? 

MS. ANAND: So certainly, Your Honor. 

There's several provisions outside the scope of 

the question presented in this case that can 

deal with any sort of gamesmanship. 

So, as Your Honor noted, there's 

equitable doctrines.  The government can raise 

waiver, forfeiture, estoppel.  There are 

doctrines -- there's statutory provisions about 

the subsequent hearing.  So, for instance, under 

1229a(b)(7), if the -- if the non-citizen had 

oral notice of the time and place of the 

hearing, they aren't eligible to apply for

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, counsel, could 

you answer the question that I -- I don't think

 you had -- really had a chance to answer the

 question that I asked, which is whether -- you 

talked about what Congress thought it was doing, 

and my question was, do you think Congress 

really thought it was doing what you are

 claiming should be the result in Mendez-Colín's 

case? 

MS. ANAND: I think that Congress 

didn't anticipate the government would ignore 

the text of the statute.  The reason that 

Congress put in the "at any time" hook is 

because they imagined these would be one-off 

circumstances where something gets lost in the 

mail or the government makes a typo and so 

switches two non-citizens' paperwork. 

They were not imagining sort of 

systematically ignoring the statute for many 

years. And so, yes, at this point, the statute 

probably leads to results Congress didn't 

intend, but that's a function of the government 

flouting the plain text of the statute and 

shouldn't be -- shouldn't have any bearing on

your reading of the remedial provision.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, as to the plain 

text of the statute, we've now had, like, an 

hour and 17 minutes of argument, and virtually 

nothing has been said about the plain text of

 1229a(b)(5)(A).  Pereira and Niz-Chavez were 

literal interpretations of the statute.

 Now there's an answer to what I'm

 going to say, but I'll get to that. 

MS. ANAND: Okay. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But, if you read the 

provision I just mentioned literally, you lose, 

right? Any alien who after written notice 

required under paragraph (1) or (2) has been 

provided to the alien, okay, notice under (2) 

was provided, right? 

MS. ANAND: So we -- we disagree with 

that. So we don't think notice under (2) was 

provided because (2) is a supplement to a valid 

(1). And so, without a valid (1), you can't 

have a paragraph (2) notice.  So our position is 

that neither notice in accordance with paragraph 

(1) --

 Niz-Chavez, which concerned very -- a -- a

 different question.  You keep saying they held

 this, they held that.  What they held had to do

 with the stop-time rule. Just the literal 

language of this, that's against you, right?

 MS. ANAND: So I disagree because we

 think there's been no paragraph (2) notice.  So

 you can't have notice required under paragraph 

(1) or (2) if you've neither gotten paragraph 

(1) notice -- that's the government's position 

in this case -- nor paragraph (2) notice, which 

is our contention about how you read paragraph 

(a)(2). 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Your position then 

is a paragraph (2) notice isn't really a 

paragraph (2) notice if there was not a 

paragraph (1) notice that was compliant? 

MS. ANAND: That's correct. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And where does 

that come from in the text of the statute? 

MS. ANAND: Two pieces.  First is the 

word "change," which, as we've explained, we 

don't think encompasses the difference between 

TBD and March 15th.  The second is it's a change

of the time and place of such proceeding.  So, 

again, this is my voter registration

 hypothetical.  If you never filled out your

 voter registration form, your change of party

 affiliation form doesn't -- is -- is not valid

 either.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Your argument, I 

think, treats the following two people 

differently. And that might be just, well, yes, 

it does, and we're living in this world where 

this is a strange statute because the government 

has been out of compliance for so long and it 

leads to some kind of strange results. 

But I'll -- I'll tell you that I think 

that this is a kind of strange result and I want 

to ask you to -- to comment on it, which is one 

person gets (a)(1) notice that is perfect and it 

says January 15th and then later gets (a)(2) 

notice saying, mhmmm, let's make it June 15th 

instead. 

Now the second person gets (a)(1) 

notice that is perfect except that it says to be 

determined, and then there's a later (a)(2) 

notice that says, okay, here's the new notice, 

June 15th.

Now I understand your view as to why 

the statutory text makes those two people 

different, but, you know, to go back to the

 Chief Justice's point about sort of, huh, like, 

why are those two people in any different

 situations with respect to anything we care

 about? Why does one have the ability to reopen

 and the other does not?

 MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, Congress 

was trying to address this problem in gross. 

So, in an individual case, there may not be much 

of a difference, but in general, Congress found 

that these TBD provisions in the notice to 

appear, remember, that's the one document that 

actually gets handed to the non-citizen, right? 

And so what Congress found is, if you 

put a date and time in the notice to appear, 

there's at least one time where the non-citizen 

knows I have to be at immigration court, I can 

figure everything else out. 

If you only put a "TBD" in the notice 

to appear, what Congress found is the subsequent 

notices have a hard time getting to the 

non-citizen. And so the non-citizen never has a 

date and time certain they have to show up.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not sure that

 the -- that the statute does suggest that. I

 mean, the statute allows for, again, assuming 

you have perfect (a)(1) notice, you can have an 

(a)(2) notice and then you can have another

 (a)(2) notice and another (a)(2) notice, and all 

of these things are extremely difficult for any

 non-citizen to figure out, and the statute 

appears not to care about that. 

So why should the statute care about 

the difference between a "to be determined" and 

a certain date? 

MS. ANAND: So I think Congress 

assumed that the government would do its best to 

hold the hearing on the date in the NTA and only 

use the notice of change if it actually had to 

change the date. 

But you're right, in some cases, 

potentially, you know, a non-citizen who gets a 

TBD notice and a non-citizen who gets a notice 

with a date and time are similarly situated. 

But this Court's holding in Pereira 

and Niz-Chavez is, even if Congress's judgment 

was off on this, even if in many cases it 

doesn't make a difference, Congress has

determined that what makes a valid NTA is the 

inclusion of these seven pieces of information, 

one of which the government didn't include here.

 But --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I think the 

government's broad argument is it's very odd 

when someone gets notice of the time and date of

 the hearing and skips it intentionally, flouting 

the system, thumbing your nose at the system, 

and then comes back when they're caught and 

says, oh, that removal in absentia was no good. 

Why? Oh, because I didn't have notice of the 

time and date of the hearing, when we know -- so 

I think that's the government's kind of 

overarching concern about reading the statute 

your way. 

MS. ANAND: Sure, Your Honor.  So I 

think that the problem is you can't just look at 

this provision in isolation, right?  So what 

Congress thought it was doing was it was giving 

the government all the cards. If you don't want 

-- if you don't want someone to skip the 

hearing, just put these seven pieces of 

information on the notice to appear, and then 

they can't skip the hearing.

There're other places in the scheme 

that allow for consideration of exactly the kind

 of fault analysis you're talking about.  So, for 

instance, you know, if you get to reopen your 

hearing, you may be ineligible for various forms 

of discretionary removal under 1229a(b)(7) if 

you're that person who gets, you know, notice --

oral notice of the date and time of the hearing 

and just doesn't show up. As some of the 

Justices have alluded to, there may be some 

residual discretion embedded in the "may" in 

(b)(5) that gives the IJ some discretion. 

All we're talking about is the 

eligibility criteria to even be able to file a 

motion to reopen.  And at that stage, Congress 

didn't ask about notice generally, notice of the 

time of the hearing.  It asked about notice in 

accordance with these two provisions that 

prescribe a particular format for the 

information.

government to be able to put in the orders a

 time that they'll stick to?  I mean, is --

 there's a reason they say, you know, TBA or TBD,

 right? And yet, you seem to think that we ought 

to analyze it as if the facts on the ground are

 not what they are, which may be right.  I mean, 

if Congress doesn't like it, maybe they can

 change it.

 But it -- it seems to me, at -- at 

least in terms of practicalities, to say, well, 

they ought to put the time on when they issue 

the order, and if they don't, all these 

consequences are going to follow.  The 

government makes the argument that, well, there 

are a lot -- they're just not able to do that. 

And if there's a reading of the statute that 

makes more sense or at least sense to deal with 

the situation on the ground, is that something 

we should consider? 

MS. ANAND: So I think the -- the 

short answer is no, but I also want to push back

MS. ANAND: Sure.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- push --

MS. ANAND: On the premise of your 

question, following Pereira, as my friend on the 

other side has told you, the government has been 

able to, in the mine run of cases, put dates and 

times in these notices.  And the immigration 

judges' brief tells us that there was until 2014 

a scheduling system that as far as these former 

immigration judges understand, had the ability 

to schedule these date and time of the hearings. 

So that evidence that prior to 2014, 

there was a scheduling system, post-Pereira the 

government's been able to do it, strongly 

suggests that actually the government has had 

the ability to do this and has chosen not to, 

despite knowing, as this Court put it in 

Niz-Chavez, since 1996 that this was a 

requirement.

MS. ANAND: So I -- I don't have those

 numbers, Your Honor.  But I'll note that prior 

to 1996, Congress gave the government the 

option, right? It said you could put the -- the 

date and time in the order to show cause, which 

was the predecessor to the NTA, or somewhere 

else if you couldn't do it.

 And in 1996, Congress made the 

decision that it was no longer going to kind of 

excuse the government from putting the date and 

time in the initial document, and it did that 

with a full understanding, right, the government 

testified at that hearing, of the logistical 

problems of doing so. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 

Justice Thomas? 

Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If the -- the date 

that the government puts in an NTA is sort of an 

aspirational date, but in a good percentage of 

those cases, they end up having to change the 

date, is that -- is that system better for 

non-citizens than a system that would tolerate 

the TBD in the initial NTA?

MS. ANAND: So Congress made the

 determination it was better.  And I think that's 

because of what I said to Justice Kagan; namely, 

the NTA is the document that's generally handed

 to the non-citizen. It's the one you know they

 got. And at the very least, if they have some 

date and time, they can come to immigration

 court and find out that their hearing was moved; 

whereas, if they have no information about when 

and where to show up, except for a document 

that's mailed that may or may not reach them, 

then they may never clarify when their 

hearing --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that doesn't 

really answer the question, because they may be 

handed a document, an NTA with an aspirational 

date, but if they are later sent a document with 

a change, mailed to the address that they 

provide, you know, they're in the same 

situation. 

MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, I -- I 

think that's precisely the argument that was 

made in dissent in Niz-Chavez. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, I know. I'm not 

asking you about -- I know -- I'm not asking you

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm asking you about

 MS. ANAND: Well, maybe I'll just cite 

the majority in Niz-Chavez, which said that we 

think another result is more likely still, which 

is that the government will develop its computer

are likely to stick.

 then, time is usually given for people to confer 

with counsel and do other things.

 I'm assuming that this time -- TBA, as 

you explained, is just the start of the process,

 correct?  You show up on that day and -- and you 

either say I'm going to get an attorney or you 

say I need more time to prepare or something

 else happens, correct? 

MS. ANAND: I think that's exactly 

right, Your Honor, and so the reason you need 

that date is, for instance, to be able to get an 

attorney, right?  It's clear then that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the point being 

that a system that continues with TBA does every 

-- all the damage you're saying. It doesn't 

tell people where they should go to find out if 

something has been changed or to direct --

figure out where to hire a lawyer, given that I 

know that many of these TBAs are in 

jurisdictions different than where the alien was 

served, correct?

right. Yes.

there's a lot of things to do with a date that

 you can't do with a -- don't happen with a TBA.

 MS. ANAND: That's exactly right. 

And, again, Your Honor, Congress was replacing a 

prior system that did this kind of case-by-case

 did the non-citizen get enough analysis -- did 

-- did the non-citizen get enough notice

 analysis.  And what it said is, rather than 

having that scheme where we're going to ask on a 

case-by-case basis, we're going to come up with 

a blanket rule that's much easier to administer. 

Yes, in some cases, it's going to be 

underinclusive.  Some non-citizens are going to 

be genuinely confused notwithstanding this form. 

In some cases, it's going to be overinclusive. 

Some non-citizens had all the information they 

needed, but -- but the government didn't comply 

with the text of the statute.  But Congress 

determined that a rule was better than the sort 

of fuzzy pre-1990 standard.

this case, unlike Niz-Chavez and Pereira, that

 the government hadn't rested on policy arguments 

as a basis for ruling in its favor here.

 Am I mistaken?

 MS. ANAND: I think that because the

 plain text of the statute counsels in our favor, 

the government's strongest argument is about the 

consequences to the immigration system, which we 

don't deny. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Did -- did they make 

that in their brief?

hand, a suggestion that it's harmless or might 

be absurd to require the government to fill in a

 TBD. Congress -- Congress may have thought 

dates were important, but, nah, they're not that

 important.

 And on the other hand, the potential

 that an alien might -- might be removed from the

 country in absentia without any notice of the 

charges against him, his right to an attorney, 

the facts of his case, based on a compliant 

notice of change which just says show up on a 

date certain and you don't know where it's 

coming from necessarily or who, and then clear 

and convincing evidence in whatever form that 

the government may supply in a non-adversarial 

proceeding, a inquisitorial proceeding before 

its own employee and immigration judge. 

How do we weigh those two 

consequential arguments? 

MS. ANAND:  Sure, Your Honor.  So I 

think the short answer is Congress has done that 

weighing for you, right, that the date and time 

is situated no differently from the other 

information listed in paragraph (1).

weighing, as Your Honor noted, the first -- the

 first sort of downside is entirely within the

 government's control.  The government can just 

put a date and time on the notice to appear, as

 it acknowledged nearly 30 years ago the statute 

required it to do.

 On the other hand, the non-citizen has

 no control over whether they get adequate

 notice.  And so, in the hypothetical you're 

talking about where they're never told of the 

charges against them, they're removed in 

absentia without an opportunity to present their 

case before the immigration judge, that's a 

pretty draconian sanction. 

And there's a reason why Congress 

wanted to be -- to -- in absentia removal orders 

in particular to be able to be reopened at any 

time if there's inadequate notice.  It's because 

Congress thought that downside of someone being 

removed with inadequate notice was so -- was so 

draconian and so severe that it gave this remedy 

to non-citizens.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You say inadequate 

notice, but they had notice.

 MS. ANAND: That's right, Your Honor. 

Again, Congress replaced the kind of reasonable 

notice or notice of the hearing regime with 

notice in accordance with paragraphs (1) or (2),

 right? So Congress thought that rather than

 doing a kind of case-by-case determination, 

we're just going to ask that the government 

comply with these two paragraphs of the statute. 

And, again, it thought that it was 

making things easier on the government.  Rather 

than doing this kind of case-by-case analysis, 

we'll just let the government follow these 

precise instructions, put these seven pieces of 

information on a piece of paper, and we won't 

ask further.  So --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, Congress was 

concerned, correct me if I'm wrong, about people 

not showing up for their removal hearings, 

right? 

MS. ANAND: That's exactly right.  And 

so it thought that the kind of reasonable 

notice, the sort of predecessor regime, gave too 

much leeway to immigration judges to say, well,

this person was confused, this person got this

 document and not that document.

 And so what it wanted to do was make

 these in absentia removal orders easier to 

obtain by giving the government all the power. 

Government, comply with the statute and we'll

 give you your removal order, and the non-citizen 

can't be heard to complain that the notice to

 appear was confusing. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice 

Barrett? 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why wouldn't a 

non-citizen show up if a non-citizen gets a 

notice that says here's the time and place of 

your removal proceeding and, if you don't show 

up, the consequence is removal? 

MS. ANAND: So, Your Honor, I think 

the non-citizen does have every incentive to 

show up, among other things, if they don't, ICE 

can come out and arrest them and bring them to 

the hearing and the government can get an in 

absentia removal order fairly straightforwardly. 

Even if they messed up the NTA the first time, 

all it takes is at that hearing, you know, they

say, oh, the NTA is defective, let me print it 

out again, fill in the date and time.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, no, I

 understand there's incentives.  I'm just talking 

about, like, when we're looking at the statutory

 language, I mean, Justice Alito pointed out

 the -- the text of this provision, and I guess

 I'm just -- you know, we're talking about the 

system that Congress set up, and I guess Justice 

Kavanaugh just pointed out that the notice 

that's most pertinent one might say here because 

we can imagine, you know, things that don't 

really matter.  The Chief Justice gave you the 

hypothetical of, well, well listen, maybe it 

said TBD, but now they know the notice and they 

know everything else. 

So let's just put aside whatever 

defect might have existed in the NTA.  If the 

non-citizen knows the critical information, 

here's the date and here's the time, and if you 

don't show up, you will be removed, even if the 

non-citizen has some questions maybe that the 

NTA didn't answer, why would it be draconian for 

Congress to say that that person could then be 

removed in absentia if they didn't show up?

 pre-1996 had a scheme for --

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  No. I -- I

 understand that.  But why -- I'm -- I'm --

I'm -- your -- your -- I understand your

 argument -- let's say that I disagree with your 

argument about the NTA and let's say that I 

think that maybe the removal proceeding is the 

place where the non-citizen could register 

objections to the NTA that may well render the 

proceeding invalid. 

Why wouldn't it make sense? I mean, 

because you've made arguments about the 

coherence of the scene -- scene -- scheme and 

said it would be draconian.  Why would it be, if 

the alien has that information, not show up? 

Why -- why -- what would be the incentive other 

than, as Justice Kavanaugh said, just saying 

like, well, you know, I'm just not going to show 

up? 

MS. ANAND: In Niz-Chavez, this Court 

said that the NTA is akin to the indictment in a 

criminal case.

JUSTICE BARRETT:  What -- what would

there's no incentive, it's kind of a

 technicality.

 MS. ANAND: I don't think it's a 

technicality any more than the indictment in a 

criminal case is a technicality. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So your whole 

argument really does turn on our interpreting 

(a)(1) the way that you're arguing that it has 

to have all of the information or it's totally 

invalid, that -- your whole argument really 

hinges on that? 

MS. ANAND: I think that's right.  And 

I think the practical reason for that is the 

non-citizen shows up to be prepared to defend 

against what, from whom, on what statutory 

basis. 

That can't possibly be the scheme 

Congress intended to have the non-citizen show

removal without even knowing what they're going

thinks that they're removable.

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, the

 non-citizen could show up and say, I have no 

idea what the government is intending to proceed 

against me, so please, you know, I -- I need to

 know. And at that point, the immigration judge, 

they may say the government has given completely 

inadequate notice and so can't proceed. 

MS. ANAND: Or the immigration judge 

-- the statute's constraint against that 

happening is not just the immigration judge's 

discretion.  It's you've got to do something 

like in a criminal case to let the non-citizen 

know what they're going to be facing when they 

show up.

June 15th, they're not different for the purpose 

of this scheme because there's no removal in

 absentia.  If they come, the -- they're actually 

having the hearing, right?

 So we're not talking about a situation

MS. ANAND: Yep. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- even though

 the -- the -- the one who got the defective

 notice is there, the government -- in both

 cases, the IJ issues the removal order and the

 difference then becomes that one can reopen, you

 would say --

MS. ANAND: Exactly.  Yes.

all the information and the other one couldn't. 

All right. So my question, I guess, 

is, is there anything odd or strange about 

Congress trying to enforce or police its 

requirements of the government with respect to 

notice in that way? 

So the difference is one can move to 

reopen, one can't, and so why couldn't Congress 

say, you know what, we're going to allow the 

person who didn't get all the information to 

reopen because we want to make sure that the 

government puts all the information in their 

notices per the statute?

government gets a huge procedural advantage,

 right? It gets to remove someone without them 

ever getting a hearing. And in order to get 

that procedural advantage, the government needs

 to put the information in the statute that the

 statute requires.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  So it's not

 really odd that we -- they would be treated 

differently for that purpose if we're thinking 

that's what the Congress cared about, right? 

MS. ANAND: I think that's exactly 

right. The government --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And so 

then the second question that I have is about 

the government's concern about people not 

showing up, and Justice Kavanaugh makes this 

point and I -- I take that point and I think 

that's right, but I wonder whether or not 

Congress actually is solving for that problem in 

a different way than the government is 

suggesting here, right? 

I -- the way I read this statutory 

scheme, Congress is allowing people who don't 

show up and who have an order issued against 

them in absentia to actually move to rescind

that order under certain circumstances.

 So it's not as though they say -- that 

-- that we don't have a provision that allows 

the person who doesn't show up to do something.

 And the government here is saying:  Well, what

 about all the gamesmanship of the person not

 showing up?

 I think Congress says, if you're going

 to remove -- excuse me -- if you're going to 

rescind, the burden is on you to show you never 

got the notice or that the notice was defective, 

you say, in this situation.  The burden shifts 

to the person to get the order rescinded, and 

that's the way the Congress is solving for 

people gaming the system. 

MS. ANAND: I think that's exactly 

right. So it's not only the burden shifts to 

you. It's, remember, the government can fix all 

of this, right?  The cards are in the 

government's hands.  The government can, you 

know, issue a new NTA that day, and then you've 

got no remedy going forward. 

So it's a very risky -- you know, if 

you imagine the hypothetical non-citizen who 

says, oh, I caught the government with a TBD in

the notice to appear and I'm not going to show 

up, all the government has to do to fix that is, 

at the hearing where the non-citizen doesn't 

show up, they print out the NTA again, they fill 

out the date and time, send it to the

 non-citizen, and then they can get that in

 absentia removal order.

 So it's a -- it's a game that wouldn't 

get the non-citizen much benefit. And, as Your 

Honor noted, the question of (b)(5)(C)(ii) is 

about policing the government, right?  The 

provisions in (b)(5)(C)(ii) are did the 

government turn square corners, did the 

government issue notice?  We see that in the 

other part of (b)(5)(C)(ii), which is about 

non-citizens in government custody. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And there's a way to 

prevent the gamesmanship that we're worried 

about or that the government is worried about 

here because --

MS. ANAND: I think that's exactly 

right. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- because, if you 

actually did receive the notice, you're not 

going to be able to rescind.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES L. McCLOUD

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

MR. McCLOUD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  I'd like to make one point about 

Pereira and then one point about the 

consequences of the other side's rule. 

As to Pereira, it is true that there 

are cases in this Court where the Court 

construes one statutory provision and that 

decision has the effect of resolving other 

statutory questions.  Pereira is not that case. 

And it would be very strange to pre -- to treat 

Pereira as such a case when Pereira went out of 

its way to say that its holding was narrow and 

was confined to particular statutory provisions

that are not at issue in this case.  So we don't 

think that Pereira resolves these cases, nor

 does Niz-Chavez.

 Finally, as to the consequences, the 

consequences here are not just the number of

 motions to rescind that might be filed.  The 

larger problem is that the other side's 

interpretation of these provisions deprives them 

of any sort of rational force. There's no 

reason that Congress would have enacted the 

version of the provision that Ms. Anand just 

described, and I don't think you need to look 

any further than the facts of these cases to see 

that. 

In these cases, the non-citizens got 

every single piece of information that they were 

required to get not just under paragraph (2) but 

also under paragraph (1).  They knew the 

charges, they knew the nature of the 

proceedings, and they knew that they had the 

right to counsel.  And many of them had counsel. 

Mendez-Colín's case I think is a 

perfect example.  In Mendez-Colín's case, by his 

own admission, the omission of time and place 

information in the paragraph (1) notice was

 irrelevant, and it was rendered irrelevant over 

and over again by the provision of additional

 notice.

 So to say that a provision whose 

evident purpose is about creating a defense 

based on lack of notice applies to individuals 

who had notice of all of the information 

required under the statute, I think, is 

inconsistent with any rational understanding of 

what Congress was trying to achieve.
