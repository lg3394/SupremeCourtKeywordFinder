 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear

 argument this morning in Case 22-888, Rudisill 

versus McDonough, the Secretary of Veterans

 Affairs.

 Mr. Tseytlin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

In Section 3311 of the Post-9/11 GI 

Bill, Congress awarded veterans who served after 

the September 11th attacks with an entitlement 

to wartime benefits befitting their wartime 

service.  In Section 3327 of the same Act, 

Congress created a generous benefits 

coordination regime wherein veterans who had 

earned peacetime Montgomery veteran -- benefits 

with post-9/11 service could trade the unused 

portion of those Montgomery benefits for 

Post-9/11 benefits. 

My client has no interest in trading 

his Montgomery benefits for his Post-9/11 

benefits, so he has no use for the three -- 3327

 election regime.  Rather, Petitioner is invoking 

his statutory entitlement under 3311 to cash in 

his second period of service for Post-9/11

 benefits.  That second period of service is only

 eligible for Post-9/11 benefits. It's not

 eligible for Montgomery benefits.  So there's 

nothing for my client to coordinate.

 Now the VA concedes that my client

 has, in fact, earned a statutory entitlement 

under 3311 to cash in his second period of 

service for wartime benefits.  But he takes the 

-- but the VA takes the position that Section 

3327's "may elect" clause revoked that 

entitlement until he uses up or exhausts the --

the Montgomery benefits he earned from his first 

period of service. 

But, with all respect, a "may elect" 

clause is simply now -- not how Congress revokes 

clear statutory entitlements and certainly not 

in the Byzantine manner that the VA suggests. 

Further, the exhaustion requirement that is a 

linch -- the linchpin of the VA's interpretation 

finds no ground in the statutory text and 

produces absurd results, such as punishing 

veterans with less wartime benefits for simply

having served the nation longer.

 Finally, the VA's effort to turn a 

regime plainly designed to help a category of

 veterans into a punitive regime punishing

 long-serving veterans has numerous contextual

 problems, including making 3322's concurrent --

concurrent usage bar surplusage.

 I welcome the Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  You make it seem as 

though the election mechanism doesn't play much 

of a role in -- in determining whether or not 

Petitioner is able to get the second set of 

benefits under -- the 9/11 benefits.  I thought 

that the -- 33 -- what is it -- 3327 requires 

election, but it also has limitations. 

You also seem to agree in your brief 

that you cannot -- you're limited by the 

concurrent -- you could not have the 9/11 

benefits and the Montgomery benefits 

simultaneously, right? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That's correct, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  But you also -- you 

-- you seem not to think that the coordination 

provisions apply.  So (a) applies, right?

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yeah.  So 320 -- 332(a) 

applies because it says "shall elect" --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay.

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  -- it's mandatory.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But then you say (d)

 doesn't apply.

 MR. TSEYTLIN: So the (d) says -- (d)

 says that coordination shall be governed.  And 

our submission is that we are not coordinating. 

We're --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, so what are 

you? I mean -- -

MR. TSEYTLIN:  We're --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- you have a second 

set of benefits. I thought the whole point was 

to have the benefits if you -- if you qualify 

for two, it is coordinated. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  No, Your Honor.  We're 

just using.  And though I think the -- my 

friends on the other side say we would not be 

coordinating if we first used our Montgomery 

benefits and then -- exhausted our Montgomery 

benefits and then thereafter used Post-9/11 

benefits.  I fail to understand how simply using 

Post-9/11 benefits is coordination.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I know, but you admit 

that you can't have them simultaneously. If you 

-- if you say you qualify for them and you have

 an -- a separate entitlement for them, then why

 can't you use them concurrently?

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  Because 3322(a) 

specifically says you can't use them

 concurrently.  That's the --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  So then why aren't 

you limited by 3322(d)? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well, 3322(d) is not a 

limitation.  All it is is a cross-referenced 

coordination provision.  And my friend in the V 

-- at the VA admit that that provision itself 

doesn't act as a limitation. 

Further, that provision can't possibly 

do the work here. I mean, most of the -- most 

of the sections listed as needing to be 

coordinated under 3322(d) aren't even referenced 

in 3327. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Let me ask --

MR. TSEYTLIN:  So it can't be doing --

JUSTICE THOMAS:  -- one final 

question. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  -- that kind of work.

JUSTICE THOMAS:  You -- you say that 

you are entitled to separate benefits. What if,

 rather than Petitioner having separate tours in 

the military, he had one continuous tour for a 

decade or so? Would you still have the same

 argument?

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  Absolutely the same 

argument. And when I'm talking about separate

 periods of service, I mean a period long enough 

to qualify for Montgomery benefits, which --

which is two or three years, and if you have a 

-- a period thereafter that's after 9/11, then 

that gets you a 3311 entitlement. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Tseytlin, I've 

come up with an analogy that I am using in my 

own mind to think about your argument and the 

way that you're looking at the statute, and I 

hope you can tell me whether or not I'm right 

about this. 

All right. So the two benefit -- the 

two benefits programs, the Montgomery program 

and the Post-9/11 program, are like two 

different color baseball caps that service 

members can earn.  The Montgomery benefits are a 

red hat that a service member is entitled to

when they're ready, they can wear that hat for

 up to 36 months to get a certain level of

 education benefits.

 The Post-9/11 benefits are a blue hat 

that a qualifying service member is entitled to

 receive, and they can wear that hat -- hat to 

get a different level of benefits for up to 36

 months. 

The law says that the member can earn 

more than one hat -- this is what you were just 

talking about with -- with Justice Thomas -- for 

separate periods of service, but the two hats 

can't be worn at the same time. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  You have to do one 

or the other.  And no matter how many hats the 

member has, he can only wear the hats and 

receive the corresponding benefits for a total 

of 48 months.  Is that --

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Absolutely.

 Honor.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So I think you're 

arguing that Rudisill is entitled to and has

 received both a red hat and a blue hat for the 

separate periods of qualifying service that he

 has. He had the red hat he earned under 3011 --

that's what you said at the beginning -- and the 

blue hat he earns under 3311 for his second or

 separate period of service. 

And so, at this point, he's worn the 

red hat for 25 months and 14 days and used those 

benefits for his undergraduate degree, and now 

what he'd like to do is pick up the blue hat and 

wear that for up to the total 48-month cap. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is that what you're 

saying? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So 

there's no coordination.  He's not exchanging --

I mean, it seems to me that the 3322(d) and 3327 

scenario is like a different situation.  It's 

the service member who has a red hat during the 

period of time in which he could qualify for a 

blue hat and he needs an opportunity to exchange

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  Absolutely.  I agree

 with everything you said, Your Honor.  And I

 think the fundamental problem with the VA --

what the VA has done here through this form and 

now they've defended through the courts is what 

you describe is exactly what Congress had in

 mind.

 And what the VA has attempted to do is 

they're trying to export this regime which is 

plainly designed for what you're talking about 

to a completely different scenario which 

Congress was not trying to deal with, and --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  In that scenario, 

the -- the scenario comes up, right, because we 

have 9/11 happening in September of 2001, but 

the effective date for being able to get a blue 

hat doesn't happen until 2009. 

So you have people who are serving in 

that period of time who just have access to the 

red hat scenario.  They don't -- they're not 

able to get the blue hat because it isn't 

effective yet. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yeah.

 ultimately change over their red hat to the blue 

hat, they have to have a mechanism to do it?

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  Absolutely right.  And

 it -- it's even more than that, Your Honor.

 They didn't -- but -- when they were serving and

 crediting their service to Montgomery by making 

those payments and, like my client, using up

 those benefits, the Post-9/11 program didn't 

even exist. They had no reason to know that 

they should use -- that they should save this 

period of service for -- for something else. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  And 30 -- 3327(d) 

and the limitations that -- that Justice Thomas 

referenced are just making the common-sense 

point that if you're a service member who has 

worn the red hat for some period of time and 

then you'd like to exchange it, you don't get, 

with the new blue hat, a full 36-period --

month period.  You just get the residual amount 

of time that's left on that red hat period, 

correct? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That -- that's --

that's exactly right.  But it is also 

coordination because it's actually the

3327(d) seems logical, but you couldn't intuit

 that from the regime without the 3327(d) because 

the way that Montgomery benefits are earned and 

the way that Post-9/11 benefits are earned are

 quite different.

 Montgomery benefits are earned

 basically on a per-month basis, which is that

 every additional month you serve in that 

Montgomery period of service, you get an extra 

month of Montgomery. 

When -- and Post-9/11 doesn't work 

like that at -- at all. If you serve at least 

90 days post-9/11, you always get only 36 

months.  And if you serve less than 36 months, 

then you just get --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Can I --

MR. TSEYTLIN:  -- less benefits per 

month. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- can I take you 

back to the text of the statute? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yes.

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  But wouldn't you be

 coordinating at the first step because, at that 

point, you would have been using -- you would

 have been using when you have two benefits.  But

 I --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  They --

MR. TSEYTLIN: -- I also think that --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- they say that

necessarily and that if you get into 3327 and 

you still have some Montgomery benefits that are 

unused, you are bound by 3327(d)(2)(A) then. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well, what they say is 

that the coordination provision is just 

suggestive.  It just points you to 3327, and 

then you have to decide what 3327 means.  And I 

think that must be right because it's just a 

cross-reference. 

And it also -- it just -- 3327 -- so 

3322(d) can't be doing that much work in any 

event. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, most of 

the provisions mentioned -- and if -- I urge

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  -- to coordinate it

 a suggestive cross-reference.  And then, when

 you get to 3327, if you think the

 cross-reference takes you there, all you have is

 a "may elect" clause.  And the superstructure of 

the statute then is you have a clear, 

unambiguous, plain-as-day entitlement under 

3311. 

So the question for the Court is 

whether a "may elect" clause, which is, at best, 

an oblique way to say something --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Well, the point is 

I think you have Montgomery.  You're pointed --

you have entitlement to Montgomery.  You have 

entitlement to Post-9/11.  You're pointed to 

3327 by 3322(d).  Stay with me so far. I know 

you disagree with that. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  That's fine. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But, when you get 

to 3327, then you can elect to go Post-9/11, or 

you could stick just with your Montgomery.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Those are your two

 options.

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  -- with respect,

 nothing in 3327 says that second thing.  What it

 says is you may elect.  And then it doesn't say

 any penalty for declining to elect.

 So what happens when you have a

 plain-as-day statutory entitlement under 3311,

 plain-as-day, but then you don't make an 

election under 3327, they must be saying that 

the "may elect" clause is an implicit revocation 

of your 3311 entitlement. 

And I would respectfully suggest that 

is just not a linguistically possible and 

certainly not -- not a natural way to revoke an 

entitlement. 

If you look at 33 --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It's not a 

revocation of your entitlement.  After you use 

up your Montgomery, the thing that caps you is 

the -- is the 48-month limit. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Right.  And so what --

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  What 3311 and 3312, 

which is the sister provision, say is that the 

entitlement in 3311 is subject to the 48

 entitle -- 48-month entitlement. It does not

 say that that entitlement is subject to making a

 3327 election.  And -- and I urge Your Honors to 

look at 3312 for that.

 And so, again, the structure of our 

argument is as follows:  If you have a 

plain-as-day statutory entitlement under 3311 

and you have a voluntary "may elect" clause, it 

is just not a natural or sensible reading of a 

"may elect" clause, which doesn't impose a 

penalty for declining to elect, to say that that 

implicitly revokes a plain-as-day entitlement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may make --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  One -- one --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry? 

I was just going to say it may make 

some sense into -- in what they probably 

envisioned was the normal situation, where you 

had the overlapping benefits on the basis of 

continuous service.  But I'm not sure it makes 

much sense in the situation that you have, where

It makes absolutely no sense.  The -- the

Think about it. When my -- when my

you can't have that because you still have a 

bunch of Montgomery bene- -- you have basically

That's the part where I'm getting lost 

in the conversation that you had with Justice 

Kavanaugh.  It seems to me, as I said at the

separate periods of service, you are entitled to 

two separate benefit packages.  Isn't that

And --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  And

 there was no historical circumstance that would,

 absent any specific language, say that you had 

to complete entirely all of one before you

 decided to invoke the other.  They were

 entitlements that you had because of your

 service.

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  Absolutely right.  And 

no -- it has never done that before.  It 

wouldn't make any sense to.  Why would Congress 

be enacting a regime where the -- wherein the 

statutory findings say those Montgomery 

benefits, they're outmoded, we want to reward 

wartime service with wartime benefits, and then, 

through these implications through a vague 

cross-reference to a coordination clause, say 

that no, no, what we really meant, in a bait and 

switch, is you've got to use up all 36 months of 

those benefits that we just said in our 

statutory findings are outmoded before you can 

get to the benefits that we're really enacting 

this bill to -- to -- to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is your argument

 dependent on the idea that you're not

 coordinating entitlement?

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  It -- it is not

 dependent on that.  All the coordination clause

 is is a cross-reference to 3327. Our 

superstructure of our argument is, as I've said 

a couple times, is that you have a plain-as-day

 entitlement under 3311 --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I know that you 

have a plain-as-day entitlement in 3311, but if 

you're coordinating entitlement, I -- I mean, I 

guess, you -- you -- you know, at -- at certain 

points, I took you to be saying, well, we're 

just not coordinating entitlement, but if you 

are coordinating entitlement, shall be governed 

by 3327, 3327 doesn't make the kind of 

distinction that you're making between veterans 

with one period of service and veterans with 

multiple periods of service. 

So how you do you get out of that if 

not by saying what I took you to be saying at 

some points but I didn't realize -- I didn't 

take this from your brief, that you're not 

coordinating entitlement?

MR. TSEYTLIN:  We are absolutely not

 coordinating entitlement.  We're just using 30

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So your

 argument does depend on that, the idea that 

you're not coordinating entitlement?

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  I do not believe that 

either side of this case has said that 3322(d) 

resolves this case. Certainly, if we win on the 

coordination, we win the case.  But, even if 

Your Honors think that we lose on coordination, 

it's still the case that a "may elect" clause is 

not a natural or linguistically, I say, possible 

way to revoke a statutory entitlement. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I see. So you're 

saying that even if 3322 does direct people in 

your client's position to 3327, you still win 

because this is not a mandatory provision? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yeah, and because it 

doesn't say it's revoking an entitlement.  And I 

also think that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  How does that 

compare with other statutory provisions where 

Congress did use "shall elect"?  And I think 

they did that in 3322(a) elsewhere and 3033(a).

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Yeah, I mean, I think 

the difference between "shall" and "may" is --

is critical here. I mean, it's telling the 

veteran that you don't have to elect, and it's 

not giving any penalty for not electing.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What do you do in 

your interpretation with the fact the statute in 

-- both places references as of August 1st,

 2009, I think? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Well, I think ourselves 

and the VA agree that that's just the effective 

date. It wouldn't --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Is that the 

effective date, or does that suggest something 

about what's being coordinated here, a single 

period of service? 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Certainly, it could be 

suggestive of that.  You know, in thinking 

through that interpretation, it does lead to 

some weird outcomes that are hard to -- hard to 

think Congress was intending to do, but, 

certainly, if Your Honors read it that way --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, it just seems 

to me awkward that we would read that out of the 

statute altogether rather than perhaps as a clue

worked is, when you have two periods of service,

 you can't use them at the same time, but you can

 credit the same period of service -- you can 

credit a single period of service to two types

 of benefits. 

I mean, the clearest way to see that 

with regard to the provisions here is -- is the

 Montgomery -- the traditional Montgomery program

 and the -- Montgomery Selected Reserves program. 

Under 3033(c), you can't get credit -- you can't 

get the Selected Reserves benefits and the 

traditional Montgomery benefits for the same 

period of service.  So that is a prohibition 

against drawing upon a single period of service.

you make the affirmative election. If you don't

form to tell the educational institution which

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  No. What you do is you 

fill out a form with the VA. And in -- in our

form that invoked only his second Post-9/11 

eligible only period of service. Then the VA 

will issue you a certificate of eligibility, and 

you take that into the --

 just asking about the history of the way the

it would be unusual for this one given that

 Congress didn't have this exhaust or forfeit

wondering how analogous this was, but I think 

you answered that. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  For the main GI Bills, 

they're not overlapping, but for the subsidiary 

Reserve ones and other programs, certainly, 

there are overlapping.  And there's never been a 

requirement that you use up the -- the meager 

benefits to get the good benefits.

benefits or some other types of benefits.

 And it's as of August 1st, and I think 

-- take Justice Gorsuch's point that that might 

be relevant to identifying the people in this

 particular situation.  Coordination of 

entitlement to assistance under this chapter, 

meaning the Post benefits -- Post-9/11 benefits,

 takes place under 32 -- 3322 -- or, sorry, 3327. 

And as you say, when you get there, 

you may elect.  But I thought the sort of 

critical part was 3327(d)(1), which is where the 

swap is effected. 

MR. TSEYTLIN:  Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  You -- you -- if 

you're making an election under subsection (a), 

you shall be entitled to the Post-9/11 benefits 

instead of the benefits that you would have 

received in Montgomery. 

So the reason why you're coordinating, 

I thought, under the way the -- the statute 

reads is to effect the swap of the unused 

Montgomery benefits.

obviously what 3327 is designed to do. Every

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIVEK SURI

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. SURI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

I think the crucial question in this 

case is whether Mr. Rudisill was required to 

elect Post-9/11 benefits in order to receive 

them. So I'd like to begin by discussing who

does and doesn't have to make an election in

 order to receive Post-9/11 benefits.

 A person who's entitled to benefits 

under only one program doesn't need to make an

 election.  He can just apply for the benefits 

and receive those benefits. An election is a

 choice between multiple programs.  And if you're 

covered only by one program, there's no choice

 that needs to be made. 

A person who is covered by two 

programs or more, however, does need to make an 

election.  This is explicit in the text of 

Section 3322(a), which is on page 1A of our 

brief. I'll read the relevant portion aloud. 

"An individual entitled to educational 

assistance under this chapter" -- that's 

Post-9/11 -- "who is also eligible for 

educational assistance under Chapter 30" --

that's Montgomery -- then it goes on, "shall 

elect under which chapter or provisions to 

receive educational assistance." 

In other words, if you're eligible for 

both Montgomery and Post-9/11 benefits, you must 

make a choice.  You can elect Post-9/11 

benefits, or you can elect Montgomery benefits.

And if you elect Post-9/11 benefits, that 

election would be made under 3327, triggering 

all the consequences that 3327 specifies.

 3322(d) reinforces that command.  It 

states that entitlement must be -- shall be --

 governed, coordination of entitlement shall be 

governed by 3327, and that makes it quite clear

 what 3327 is doing.

 It means that if you're eligible for 

both Montgomery benefits and Post-9/11 benefits, 

3327 is the provision you go to to combine those 

two programs.  And that's consistent with how 

the Federal Circuit applied this provision, and, 

therefore, its judgment should be affirmed. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Where do you 

statutorily peg the exhaustion requirement? 

MR. SURI: The exhaustion requirement 

arises from the fact that someone who is covered 

by only one program doesn't need to make an 

election in the first place.  So it is a 

consequence of 3322(a) and 3322(d). 

Someone who has exhausted his 

Montgomery benefits and has only Post-9/11 

benefits remaining is covered by only one 

program and, therefore, wouldn't need to make an

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Suri, I don't

 understand your reading of 3322(a).  I mean, it

 seems that your argument is turning on the

 supposition and the proposition that a person 

who has two separate periods of service and is 

entitled under the statute -- and I assume you

 don't quibble with the entitlement to the

 Post-9/11 benefits under 3311, right?  So he's 

entitled to both Montgomery and -- and 

Post-9/11. 

You say but he has to choose, as 

though he's not allowed to cash in or take 

advantage of both.  So, first of all, is -- is 

that reading coming from 3322(a) as you've said? 

MR. SURI: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  But I 

didn't hear you necessarily to read the entire 

section, which seems to me to cast a different 

light. When you say "an individual is entitled 

to educational assistance under this chapter" --

this is the beginning of 3322(a) -- it goes on 

to say, "may not receive assistance under two or 

more such programs concurrently" --

MR. SURI: Mm-hmm.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- comma, "but shall

 elect in such form as the Secretary under which 

chapters to receive addition" -- "educational

 assistance."

 It seems to me the prior reference to 

"concurrently" is doing a substantial amount of

 work to explain that you can't get them at the 

same time, but you'll need to elect which one 

you want to get at which time. That is 

different than suggesting, I think, that you 

have to choose between them such that you can 

only have one ever. 

MR. SURI: I agree with everything you 

said --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Great. 

MR. SURI: -- Justice Jackson.  But 

3327 is the mechanism by which you elect, if 

you're eligible to vote, that you now want to 

receive Post-9/11 benefits. 

And we can look at the text of these 

two provisions to see why that's so.  If you 

look at the last words of 3322(a), it says that 

you shall elect under which chapter to receive 

educational assistance.  This is page 1A of our 

brief.

And then page 4A of our brief, 3327(a)

 states:  "An individual may elect to receive 

educational assistance under this chapter...".

 So there's an exact parallelism. 

3322(a) says you shall --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  There's a sort of

 parallelism, I'll -- I'll grant you, but, as 

Justice Jackson pointed out, (a) on 3322 is

 about concurrent.  You can't have concurrent. 

That's always been the law. No surprise 

Congress wants that to be the case here. 

"Shall elect."  In other 

circumstances, Congress has used "shall elect" 

as well, 3033(a), I believe. 

Here, when we get to -- when you --

and -- and I think you agree in your brief that 

3322 doesn't resolve the question presented 

before us, right? 

MR. SURI: The question presented has 

to be resolved by looking at both provisions 

together, not by one or the other alone.  That's 

right.

"may" in this provision.  I'm just suggesting 

that the alternative to electing Post-9/11 

benefits under this provision is not, as 

Petitioner suggests, not electing them but 

receiving them anyway. 

The alternative is electing Montgomery 

benefits or continuing with Montgomery benefits,

and that's the most natural way to read (a)

 itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, 

just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's point, 

the most natural way to read "may" is "may."

 MR. SURI: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's 

very much compelled if a couple sections earlier 

you have the phrase "shall elect," which 

suggests that that's quite a different -- you 

don't have a choice there, but when they say 

"may elect," you do have a choice. 

MR. SURI: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice. 

And I would reconcile the two provisions in the 

following way:  The first provision, 3322(a), 

says you must make a choice.  You must choose 

either Montgomery or Post-9/11.  And then 

3327(a) says you may elect Post-9/11. 

Now that means the other choice that 

you have is you may elect Montgomery.  It 

doesn't mean that the other choice you have is 

receive Post-9/11 anyway without choosing it. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So you can't --

the way -- at least on -- on this point, because

 it -- it doesn't make any sense, but the reason 

that the Petitioner here has this particular

 difficulty is that he served an additional tour 

of duty after 9/11 in addition to what he had

 served before 9/11.

 Now, if you have somebody who just 

joined up after 9/11 for the same period as the 

Petitioner served, the Petitioner is getting 

less -- fewer benefits than the person who only 

served one tour of duty for the same length 

because, if he served just the -- the -- the 

Post-9/11 for, whatever, three years, he would 

get three years. 

But, because this Petitioner had 

served additionally beyond his period of 

Post-9/11, he gets -- he doesn't get the full 

benefit of the Post-9/11 benefits.  So I'm --

there must be something wrong there because that 

would -- that would not make any sense. 

MR. SURI: The reason Petitioner isn't 

getting as much -- as many months of benefits as 

the other veteran in your hypothetical is not 

that he is being penalized for serving two tours 

of duty.  The reason is he has already used 25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Montgomery

 benefits?

 MR. SURI: The Montgomery benefits,

 but a program that is designed to do a similar

 thing to the Post-9/11 program.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that

 still doesn't make all that much sense because 

he's getting those other benefits because he had 

an additional -- a couple additional tours of 

duty. So maybe, you know, he's entitled to both 

of them, but because of this other provision 

there, he can't get both at the same time, but 

it seems to me to be a pretty raw deal to say 

you're going to lose -- you're entitled -- if 

you hadn't done anything other than the 9/11, 

you would be entitled to this, but because you 

served additional period of time, you don't get 

the whole 9/11.  You've got to exhaust this 

other less generous plan first. 

MR. SURI: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

reason he is not getting the additional 

benefits, again, is not that he served an 

additional period of duty.  It's that he already

I understand that answer, it's that, look --

 look, you can only go to college so -- so many

 years, and -- and we're paying for additional --

for -- for years of college for the people who 

got Montgomery benefits, and even though you get

 additional benefits under Post-9/11, you know,

 we're not going to pay for eight years of 

college. 

MR. SURI: Let -- let me try a 

different way of explaining why --

that -- is that a good, reasonable way of 

looking at it? 

MR. SURI: That is the consequence of 

what Congress has wrote.  And let me take a stab 

at explaining why Congress might have designed 

the statute this way. 

The purpose or one purpose of the GI 

Bill is to enable someone who has served in the 

military to transition back into civilian life. 

That's why the first GI Bill was called the 

Servicemen's Readjustment Act.  It was about 

readjustment.  And Congress could conclude that

in order to readjust, you need 36 months of 

benefits. That's four years of college, nine 

months per academic year.

 And it could say that whether you get

 these 36 months through one program or through 

two programs is not of much concern to us 

because these two programs are close substitutes

 for each other.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But how do you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And --

JUSTICE JACKSON: -- reconcile that 

with the 48-month cap? I mean, there's --

there's something in the statute that Congress 

has made clear that you get up to 48 months of 

benefits.  So how -- how -- how is that 

consistent with your story about Congress having 

a purpose to limit people to 36 months? 

MR. SURI: In order to answer that 

question, I'll need to explain how the overlap 

between the Montgomery and Post-9/11 GI Bills 

differs from the overlap between previous bills.

the 48 months doesn't apply?  I mean, I thought

also serve in Korea and that's how you'd get to

 48 months.

 That's not what happens under 

Petitioner's view under this statute. Imagine a

 veteran serves six continuous years in one war,

 just the Iraq War.  What Petitioner would allow 

that person to do is say:  I'm going to apply 

the first three years of my Iraq War duty to the 

Montgomery program, apply the second three years 

to the -- to the Post-9/11 program, and get more 

than 36 months of benefits, even though I've 

served only in one war.  And that's something 

Congress has never previously allowed.

 MR. SURI: Mr. Chief Justice, this is 

the consequence of the statute that Congress has 

written.  If that statute creates hardship in 

particular cases, then Congress is free to amend 

the statute as it has done many times before. 

It is notable, however, that Congress 

was aware of the way the VA had been applying 

the statute in the 2011 amendments.  The Senate 

report accompanying that shows that.  And it 

chose not to change that interpretation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If -- if -- if I 

understand the way this statute works -- and 

this goes to your explanation of why Congress 

could have written it this way -- but if I 

understand the way the statute works, suppose a 

veteran has 35 months that he's already covered, 

so he has one left.  You're saying he has this 

choice.  He can take the -- the 36-month under

 Montgomery and, if he does that, he gets a full

 year extra under 9/11. Or he can swap out the 

Montgomery for the 9/11 for the single month 

left, and then he forfeits the additional year.

 So why would that choice be put to the

 veteran?

 MR. SURI: I can explain why Congress

 might have decided that those who have already

 exhausted their Montgomery benefits should still 

have the opportunity to get some additional 

Post-9/11 benefits.  There are a few different 

reasons that might have explained it. We don't 

know, in fact, why Congress did it. 

The first possible reason is that 

Congress was creating the Post-9/11 program and 

making it retroactive.  It knew that there would 

be some veterans who had served after 9/11 but 

before 2008, when the Post-9/11 bill was 

enacted, and who had already used up all of 

their Montgomery benefits.  And Congress may 

have wanted to ensure that those veterans get 

something, and so the something it gave them was 

to allow them to get 12 additional months after 

exhaustion.  That's one possibility. 

A second possibility is this may be an

 artifact of the fact that the Post-9/11 bill was

 originally limited to college education and the 

Montgomery bill was designed to focus on

 vocational education.  Congress may have decided 

that if you've used your 36 months of Post-9/11 

benefits to go to college, you don't need

 additional benefits under the program that's

 geared toward vocational training.  But, if you 

used your 36 months of benefits under the 

vocational program, then you might still want to 

go to college for a few years and, therefore, 

we'll leave open the option of getting the 

Post-9/11 college-related benefits. 

A third possibility is that Congress 

said: We're going to be extremely generous for 

those who want 36 months of benefits, you'll 

have this extremely helpful Post-9/11 program, 

but for those who want more than 36 months, 

we'll make a tradeoff.  You can use the less 

expensive program for most of the time when 

you're going to college and then you use the 

more expensive Post-9/11 program when you're 

going to graduate school.  This is a perfectly 

reasonable trade for Congress to make if it's 

trying to limit the overall cost of the program.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- the only 

problem with that answer, it doesn't really

 answer Justice Kagan's question. Her

 hypothetical suggested, I think, that it's 

irrational to think that Congress would say, if 

you wait and take the one month, you'll get 12, 

but if you decide to take the one -- not take

 the one month and switch over immediately, that

 you're going to lose those 12 months.  That's 

what's basically, I think, the irrationality. 

Am I assuming --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It just seems utterly 

arbitrary. 

MR. SURI: I -- I -- I'll add two 

points in response to that.  One -- one further 

possibility is that that is an unintended 

consequence of how these coordination provisions 

were written.  Coordination of benefits is a 

very complicated enterprise, and it may be that 

this is just an unintended consequence of what 

Congress wrote. 

A final possibility is that we're 

wrong about the exhaustion rule. It may be that 

once you've exhausted the Montgomery benefits, 

you don't get additional Post-9/11 benefits.

But that's not the question before the Court

 today. The only question that's presented here 

is how many months of benefits Mr. Rudisill is

 entitled to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that --

that seems odd, doesn't it, that Congress is 

going to penalize a veteran who, as the other 

side pointed out, has served the country for a

 longer period of time, put himself at risk in 

not one war but two wars, and now we're going to 

deprive him of access -- of any access to the 

more fulsome benefits. 

MR. SURI: Justice Sotomayor, no one 

is being made worse off.  Before Mr. Rudisill 

went into his third period of service in 2007, 

he had no expectation of receiving Post-9/11 

benefits because that program didn't exist yet. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but one --

the -- the very purpose of the 9/11 program was 

to ensure that he did serve.  He could have 

retired, but he chose to stay.  And there should 

be a benefit, which is what Congress made 

available to him.

But 3327 says that in order to make an

 election, you must be entitled to both

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I said 3327(h)(1).

 MR. SURI: 3327(h) states that if a

 veteran makes a choice that the Secretary 

determines is not in his best interests, the

 Secretary --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When would that

 occur?

 MR. SURI: That would occur as soon as

 the Secretary receives the election.  I will 

note that provision does not apply to this case 

because it refers to elections made from 2017 

onward.  And this particular election was made 

before 2017. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  What is your 

response to your counterpart's contention that 

the work of 3327 is to effect the swap and that 

insofar as Mr. Rudisill is not seeking to swap, 

it doesn't apply to him? 

MR. SURI: I appreciate the chance to 

answer that question.  I -- I'd give a few 

answers to that. 

The first is the text of 3327(a), 

again, page 4A of our brief, says an individual 

may elect to receive.  It's talking about 

receiving benefits, not converting benefits or

 The second point is a structural one.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, go on to (d). 

Right, (d), "subject to paragraph 2 and except 

as provided in (e), an individual making an 

election under (a)," which is what you just 

referenced, right, "shall be entitled to 

benefits under this chapter instead of." So is 

that not doing the work of saying the reason why 

you're in 3327 at all is because, if you're an 

(a) person who has made an election, you are 

seeking to convert? 

MR. SURI: I -- I appreciate the force 

of the point with respect to (d) if you look at 

that provision alone, but if you go back up to 

(a), it says that in order to make an election, 

you have to both be entitled to Montgomery 

benefits, that's (a)(1), and be entitled to 

Post-9/11 benefits. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, I --

MR. SURI: That's (a)(2). 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I -- I take that 

point. But just to follow up on my colleague's 

observation, (d) tells us what the effect of an 

election under (a) is, right?

period of service, but that period of service is 

happening at a time in which only Montgomery

 benefits are available to him because Post-9/11 

has not yet been in effect, but he's earning

 Post-9/11 because he's serving after 9/11.

 And the question is, will he be 

relegated to just having Montgomery because that 

was all that was available to him during his 

period of service, or is there some mechanism 

that allows him to get the Post-9/11 benefits 

that he's entitled to because of his period of 

service?  And I read 3327 as doing that. 

MR. SURI: Exactly right.  3327 is the 

mechanism for someone who is entitled to both 

programs to start receiving Post-9/11 benefits. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, but not 

because of separate periods of service.  Mr. 

Rudisill says, I'm not entitled in the same way. 

I'm entitled to these separately because I have 

two periods of service, not the one that is 

falling in the overlap.  I have two, he says. 

MR. SURI: And -- and my response to 

that is there's no statutory text whatsoever 

that draws a distinction between one period of 

service and two in 3327 or in 3322(d), the

 provision that points to 3327.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  (a), you pointed to 

two periods of service in 3322(a).

 MR. SURI: 3322(a) doesn't say

 anything about periods of service either.  And 

it's notable that Petitioner says that many 

provisions in this statute that have -- that say

 nothing about periods of service apply to him. 

For example, 3322(a) says you can't use two 

different programs concurrently. He says that 

applies to him.  He doesn't say that doesn't 

apply to people with multiple periods of 

service. 

So he seems to be reading in a 

multiple-period-of-service limitation to 3327 

but not to these other provisions, and he 

doesn't explain the justification for that, 

other than, potentially, it would be a fairer or 

more sensible scheme.  And he may be right about 

that, but this is not the forum for that debate.

 veterans are affected by this question?

 MR. SURI: The -- we don't know 

exactly. The best estimate that we have is that 

it could be up to 30,000 veterans who 

potentially would be affected, that is,

 individuals who fall into the same multiple 

periods of service and have already used some

 Montgomery benefits category.

 That doesn't mean, however, that all 

of them have plans to go to graduate school or 

all of them would use the benefits that would be 

available. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  When a veteran enrolls 

in a college program and fills out the form to 

get benefits from the VA, if that veteran asks 

for Montgomery benefits, does that constitute an 

election not to receive the 9/11 benefits? 

MR. SURI: That constitutes an 

election to receive Montgomery rather than 

Post-9/11 benefits.  But, to respond to a 

question that you posed to Mr. Tseytlin earlier 

if I may, that election is not irrevocable.  The 

only election that's irrevocable is the election 

of Post-9/11 benefits, and that follows from the 

text of 3327(i).

 Sotomayor?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A follow-on to

 that last question.  I -- the way I understand 

your reading of the statute, someone who

 qualifies for Montgomery and Post-9/11 benefits 

under separate periods of service could not use

 their 36 months of Post-9/11 benefits first and 

then get 12 of Montgomery? 

MR. SURI: That is prevented by a 

different provision that we haven't talked about

you've elected Post-9/11 benefits, you're no

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  So there

 has to be an election.  And your point is the 

only way to make an election is under 3327?

 MR. SURI: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  Second, I

 think you had been asked about the other side's 

point that 3327 is best read as a swap or 

trade-in provision, and you said you appreciated 

the opportunity to answer the question, but I 

don't think you were able to get the answer.  So 

I'm giving you a full opportunity to answer that 

question. 

MR. SURI: Thank you, Justice 

Kavanaugh.  The first answer is the textual 

point, which is 3327(a) says an individual may 

elect to receive educational assistance under 

this chapter. That echoes the language of 

3322(a), which says "shall elect" under which 

chapter to receive educational assistance. 

That's a clue that this provision is 

one of the options that is on the table under 

3322(a).  3322(a) is saying you must pick either 

Chapter 30, Montgomery, or Chapter 33,

 Post-9/11. And this provision is saying here's 

how you pick Post-9/11.  That's one answer.

 The second answer is the structure of

 3327(a).  It -- it applies only to individuals 

who are eligible for both programs, so that 

precludes the idea that it's meant to allow 

someone who is eligible for one program to trade 

in benefits in order to obtain the other

 program.  You have to already have Post-9/11 

benefits in order to make this election in the 

first place.  And that's in the text of 

3327(a)(2). 

The third answer is going back to 

3322(d), a provision that was discussed earlier 

during Mr. Tseytlin's argument.  It states that 

the -- it -- it tells us what 3327 is designed 

to do. It states that an individual must 

coordinate entitlement under 3327.  It doesn't 

say that an individual can convert entitlement 

under 3327. 

It's notable that in Mr. Tseytlin's 

brief, he resorts to phrases such as the veteran 

has no need to "coordinate" Montgomery benefits 

into Post-9/11 benefits.  That's not a normal 

usage of the word "coordinate."  You coordinate

 coordinate or convert one program into another

 program.

 So those are the textual reasons that 

-- the most important textual reasons that 3327

 can't be about swapping.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  How much

 significance, if any, is there that it says

 "coordination of entitlement" and not 

"coordination of benefits"? 

MR. SURI: That is a very significant 

point, Justice Kavanaugh, because that too 

suggests that this provision is meant to address 

specifically veterans who are entitled to both 

programs.  Congress thought about veterans who 

have multiple types of entitlement, and it wrote 

this provision saying:  Go look at 3327 to 

determine how to coordinate those programs.

last point, you've repeatedly emphasized that 

this is about veterans who already have

 entitlements to both programs, right?

 What I don't see in 32 -- 3327(a)(2) 

is language that supports that. If you look at

 that actual provision, it says -- it's talking 

about an individual who may elect to receive if 

they are, as of August 1st, under these certain

 categories.  That's (a)(1). 

MR. SURI: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON: And then, as of the 

date of the individual's election, meets the 

requirements for entitlement to educational 

assistance under this chapter. 

MR. SURI: Yes. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  That -- so the 

language there is not "is entitled" or "already 

has been entitled."  It seems to be suggesting 

that if you're one of these people who meets the 

entitlement, then you can go on, as Justice 

Gorsuch points out, to (d), which tells us what 

happens, that you can exchange -- I mean, do you 

-- do you dispute that (d) has sort of an 

exchange quality to it? 

MR. SURI: I -- I don't dispute that.

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So what's it doing

 if -- if not the swap?

 MR. SURI: I'll -- I'll say a couple

 of points in response to that.  The first is the 

only way to be entitled to Post-9/11 benefits is 

to meet the requirements for entitlement.

 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I appreciate, 

but Congress doesn't use superfluous words. 

When we interpret a statute, if it says "meets 

the requirements," it's doing something 

different, presumably, than "you are entitled," 

which is the way you're reading it. 

MR. SURI: I think that's giving the 

drafters of this statute a little too much 

credit, Justice Jackson. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So what 

is (d) doing if not the swap? 

MR. SURI: (d) is providing two 

things.  (d)(1) is stating that you cease to be 

entitled to one form of benefit and you -- you 

can start using the other form of benefit. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  But why?  I thought 

you said they were entitled to both.  And what

 MR. SURI: And -- and one last point

 if I may, Justice Jackson.  It's notable that

 3327(a)(1) also refers to individuals who don't 

have any Montgomery benefits in the first place. 

So this is in 3327(a)(1)(F), is a member of the 

armed forces who is not entitled to Montgomery 

benefits.  So --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right.  Because a 

lot of people were -- were shuttled to this, 

right, from 3322(d)?  There were lots of people, 

not only the Montgomery benefit people, but 

others get there. 

MR. SURI: I -- I think that defeats 

the conversion idea.  These people have no 

benefits to convert, and yet they're covered by

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. TSEYTLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

 My friend started with 3322(a).  I 

think it's pretty remarkable that they appear to

 be basing their argument based on this provision

 that the -- the election in 3322(a) is a

 mandatory election, which is clearly in service 

of the concurrent usage bar, is -- doing 

completely different work than 3327.  It is 

identical to the -- to the election mechanism in 

33 -- in -- in 3033(a), and my friend doesn't 

say that that somehow shuttles somebody into 

3327. 

In fact, the -- that provision 

strongly supports our position in two respects. 

One is the suggested difference between "may" 

and "shall"; and second is that their 

interpretation renders 3327 -- 3322(a)'s use of 

a mandatory bar on concurrent usage super --

superfluous because, under their reading of --

under -- of 3327, a veteran who's entitled to 

Montgomery and Post-9/11 either has to use up 

all their Montgomery benefits and -- to get to 

Post-9/11 or give up their Montgomery benefits

 would be impossible, which means that this

 entire provision would be superfluous.

 Second, 30 -- 3327 is plainly a

 swapping mechanism, and every provision, every

 subsection of 3327 points in that direction.

 We talk about (a).  That's the

 voluntary election mechanism.  My -- I heard my

 friend mention (a)(1)(F).  That provision serves 

absolutely no function under his exhaustion view 

because that person has no Montgomery benefits 

to exhaust. 

With regard to (b), that -- that lets 

you stop paying.  With regard to (c), that lets 

you revoke the transfer of Montgomery benefits 

because now they're so much more beneficial 

because you can trade them for Post-9/11 

benefits.  (d) is plain as day a swap. (f) lets 

you get your Montgomery payments back pro rata. 

Every single indication is that 

Congress was creating a swap mechanism, not an 

exclusive mechanism to invoke your 3311 

entitlement, unless you've exhausted your --

your Montgomery benefits.

even more absurd land, where veterans who served 

before 9/11 used up all of their benefits, 

Montgomery benefits before 9/11, then felt the 

call after the September 11th attacks, would be 

entitled to no Post-9/11 benefits whatsoever? 

That's even more absurd than the absurd 

exhaustion concept. 

And then I will close on the

whatnot are entirely unnecessary.  The statute

Official 

should be read as what it says:  3311 gives you

 a plain-as-day entitlement.  3327 is a voluntary 

swap mechanism, does not limit that entitlement

 in any way. 

Read in that way, the statute has no 

superfluity, has no problems in it, and it 

plainly achieves the pro-veteran purposes for

 which Congress enacted the Post-9/11 GI Bill. 

Thank you, Your Honors. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case
