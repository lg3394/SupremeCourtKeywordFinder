 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 22-1025,

 Gonzalez versus Trevino. 

Ms. Bidwell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANYA A. BIDWELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BIDWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Respondents try to over-read Nieves in 

two ways.  They need to win on both attempts. 

Each is wrong and would lead to results this 

Court could not have intended. 

First, Respondents say Nieves's rule, 

designed for a representative case of 

in-the-field law enforcement, now insulates all 

government officials.  Picture the thin-skinned 

bureaucrat scouring for a crime to pin on his 

critics.  According to Respondents, Section 1983 

has nothing to say about that. 

Second, Respondents parse Nieves like 

a statute to say that it limits plaintiffs to a 

particular type of comparative example.  To be 

sure, Nieves did recognize that evidence of

subjective motive alone would not get a

 plaintiff an inference that this motive caused

 the adverse action.  But Nieves does not blind

 courts to all but one type of objective evidence

 of causation.

 Respondents' position extends Nieves

 beyond its moorings.  If the mayor in this case

 got in front of TV cameras and announced that he 

was going to have Ms. Gonzalez arrested because 

she challenged his authority, the existence of 

probable cause would make this evidence legally 

irrelevant. 

Respondents' position would also toss 

out of court a critic arrested for jaywalking on 

a remote country road, even if his town had 

never arrested anyone for jaywalking before, 

simply because he couldn't find a non-critic who 

jaywalked on the same spot. 

Nieves balanced important First 

Amendment concerns to protect the on-the-street 

first responder making a "now or never" decision 

to arrest a suspect in his grasp.  It did not so 

loosely dispense with the First Amendment 

interests as to give government armchair 

quarterbacks a free hand at the time of their

choosing to punish their critics.

 I welcome this Court's questions.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  In Nieves, we dealt 

with an arrest, and is it different here because 

you have a warrant process, you have an

 investigation?  Does that break the causal link, 

that we would have a case just where a police

 officer arrests the plaintiff?

 MS. BIDWELL: No, Your Honor, it 

doesn't.  In fact, the fact that warrant exists 

here helps us for two reasons.  Number one, we 

have an analogue at common law, abuse of 

process, because warrant is a classic legal 

process, but, number two, when it comes to 

but-for causation, magistrates are required to 

look at the arrest affidavit in order to issue a 

warrant.  So the arrest affidavit, which we say 

would not have been issued had it not been for 

retaliatory animus, is something that 

magistrates have to take into account, and it is 

a but-for causation. 

And as this Court explained in Bostock 

and just this term in Murray, there could be 

many but-for causations. Our burden is to show 

that, had it not been for animus, that the

arrest would not have occurred.  That's just one

 but -- but-for causation, one but-for cause, and 

we meet that requirement here.

 JUSTICE THOMAS:  You say that you use 

abuse of process as the analogue. Have we ever

 used that in -- in -- in these retaliation

 cases?

 MS. BIDWELL: You didn't, but that was

 because there was no process.  So, in Lozman, 

you had an on-the-spot arrest. In Reichle, you 

had an on-the-spot arrest.  In Nieves, you had 

an on-the-spot arrest. So this is the first 

time that this Court actually sees a case with a 

warrant coming before it. 

And just as at common law, a -- a 

plaintiff could bring a claim even if there was 

a warrant.  For example, in Jackson versus 

American Telephone Company, there was a warrant 

for a serious offense.  It was a warrant for 

assault with a deadly weapon, and it was 

properly issued.  But a plaintiff still had a 

cause of action because that warrant was used as 

a pretext for private purposes, inconsistent 

with the exigencies of the writ in the words of 

common law.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your answer is

 quite interesting and -- and I think informative 

because, as you say, if the warrant never should 

have been sought, it's a different kind of

 but-for.

 But also, in many jurisdictions, 

Florida and California, judges don't make 

probable cause determinations, correct, when 

they issue warrants, so --

MS. BIDWELL: According to 

Respondents, there are some jurisdictions where 

there is a discretion to not issue a warrant. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  And, 

secondly -- and some warrants are false?  There 

are material falsehoods in a warrant? 

MS. BIDWELL: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you can't say 

as a matter of law that that is -- can break the 

causation, correct? 

MS. BIDWELL: Your Honor, yes, but 

when -- when -- we're -- we were talking here 

about not a discretion not to issue a warrant. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.

Amendment to look at two things, whether there 

is probable cause under a warrant and look at 

the oath and affirmation. They have no choice 

but to look at the oath and affirmation. And we

 know that this is oath -- oath and affirmation

 here is the affidavit.  And magistrate had no

 choice but to look at that affidavit.  And we're 

saying that the affidavit would not have been 

obtained had it not been for animus. 

It's very different from retaliatory 

prosecutions and Hartman because, there, a 

prosecutor can look at many different things in 

order to make a determination of whether to 

pursue the prosecution.  An affidavit for a 

warrant can be one of those things, but it 

doesn't have to be that thing. 

So that was the problem in Hartman, 

where you couldn't even get enough evidence of a 

but-for cause without looking into the head of 

the prosecutor.

 probably on -- on a clean slate would likely

 agree with you, but what do I do with the line 

in Nieves that says that "plaintiff pressing a 

retaliatory arrest claim must plead and prove 

the absence of probable cause for the arrest"?

 Sort of --

MS. BIDWELL: Yes.  So, Nieves, we're

 talking about the holding not extending beyond 

its reasoning. And the reasoning in Nieves is 

colored by this representative case, which, 

as -- as the government argued in Nieves, is the 

vast bulk of cases which are an on-the-spot 

arrest cases. 

And we're talking about in Nieves 

having to evaluate police officers under 

objective standard of reasonableness at the time 

when they have to take speech into account while 

making a determination whether to arrest a 

suspect or not.

to emphasize the narrowness of the exception.

 MS. BIDWELL: Your Honor, that's 

because Nieves talks about a vast bulk of

 retaliatory arrest cases.  The -- the typical 

retaliatory arrest case is when a police

 officer, like in Nieves, is patrolling the 

streets, having to, not on his own time but on a

 suspect's time, having to respond to dangerous

 situations.  The last thing we want is for 

police officer worrying about communicating with 

a suspect. 

So that's why, even under the 

objective evidence carveout, statements and 

motivations of a particular arresting officer 

are irrelevant at that point. 

Nieves covers all these cases that are 

important, and there is a very particular 

causation complexity in Nieves in that it is 

impossible to untangle what a police officer is 

thinking at the time.  As Justice O'Connor 

explained in her -- in Quarles, police officers, 

when they're making on-the-spot decisions, have 

-- themselves don't have a fully formed 

understanding of why they're doing what they're 

doing.

So it's a very particular causal 

complexity that's present in a lot of cases, but

 it is not present in a case like this one, where 

you have two months to issue a warrant based on

 no new information.  All information that was 

developed developed at the time when 

Ms. Gonzalez took this piece of paper from one

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But doesn't the --

doesn't the causal complexity concern the causal 

complexity that face -- that would face courts 

if the rule were otherwise, not causal 

complexity that is limited to the situation 

where there is what you call an on-the-spot 

arrest? 

MS. BIDWELL: It concerns courts, 

right, because you don't want judges 

second-guessing what police officers are doing 

when they're making very difficult decisions 

whether to arrest a suspect, whether to remove 

the suspect from the streets.  And they also 

have to communicate to the suspect. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that exists 

whether or not it's an on-the-spot arrest.  The 

causal complexity exists in -- in all of the

class of cases that Nieves was talking about.

 And when the Court was stating what it

 held, I don't see a reference to split-second

 decisions.  The Court says that "Nieves and

 Weight argue that the same" -- that no probable

 cause -- that there should be a no probable

 cause requirement.  "Their primary contention... 

is that retaliatory arrest claims involve causal 

complexities akin to those identified in 

Hartman.  As a general matter, we agree." 

Then later, when it's stating the 

holding, "Because there was probable cause to 

arrest Bartlett, his retaliatory arrest claim 

fails as a matter of law."  I don't see a 

reference to split-second decisions. 

MS. BIDWELL: Your Honor, on page 

1725, you make reference to split-second 

decisions when you're explaining a particular 

type of causal complexity here where an officer 

has to make a decision whether to arrest and in 

that moment has to determine -- take speech into 

account to determine whether suspect is ready to 

cooperate. 

And that very example also appears in 

Reichle.  That very example also appears in

 particularly difficult to untangle.

 Other causal complexities -- and --

and with the -- of course, with prosecutors, you 

have your own separate problem where you need to

 actually talk to a prosecutor to determine what 

the prosecutor was thinking, and that

 second-guessing those decisions is also

 difficult. 

But the kind of causal complexity 

that's present here is very similar to the 

causal complexity in Mt. Healthy.  Mt. Healthy 

created the burden-shifting framework to ensure 

that we can disentangle proper considerations of 

speech from improper considerations of speech.

 allowed objective evidence of causation to come 

in other than what the Fifth Circuit is talking 

about, which is a very specific comparator of

 non-arrests.

 But our position is that Nieves 

covered the vast bulk of cases, and those cases

 involve on-the-spot police officers having to

 make very difficult decisions. 

On the other -- on the one hand, you 

only have mere allegations of state of mind.  On 

the other hand, you have probable cause.  And 

this Court said that in those types of

 apply. 

That said, Your Honor, there is a way

 to -- we would be happy with the Fifth Circuit

 reversal on either one of the questions

 presented.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  On -- on -- on the 

argument that you have been making, I -- I -- I 

agree with you that the split-second arrest 

seems to be a key part of the Court's reasoning, 

maybe not all of the Court's reasoning but some 

critical part of it. 

But I -- I guess I wonder whether 

dividing the world into split-second arrest 

cases versus other cases is going to be a very 

difficult thing to do. I mean, presumably, if 

we look at the world of cases in which 

retaliatory arrest is charged, they're going to 

fall on a spectrum with the most split-second 

arrest case over here and something that looks 

extremely different over there and a lot of 

stuff in the middle. 

And it seems hard to me to draw that 

line in a way that would prove administrable,

 predictable, so I was wondering -- yeah, respond

 to that.

 MS. BIDWELL: Yes, Your Honor.  Our 

position on Question Presented 2 is that the --

the line to be drawn is at the well-known Fourth

 Amendment standards to the police officers about 

initial lawful encounter. As long as probable

 cause and arrest within -- arise within that 

same initial lawful encounter, it doesn't have 

to be split second, Your Honor.  It can be -- it 

can last for a while.  But, as long as it's 

within this initial lawful encounter, then 

police arrests go under Nieves.  But, when that 

encounter ends that, no. 

And I'd like to also emphasize that 

within that initial lawful encounter, you can 

obtain a warrant, an emergency warrant, for 

example, or if you encounter a suspect and then 

you pulled up information on him and all of a 

sudden you see, oh, there is a warrant for 

previous arrest, then you could use -- when you 

learn of the warrant and, as long as you arrest 

within the same initial encounter, then you fall 

within Nieves.  And those are traditional Fourth 

Amendment concepts that police officers are

 That said, Your Honor, I understand

 that an -- another way to go about this, as I

 indicated in my opening, is to put all arrests

 should be allowed irrespective of its form.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I was reading the

 complaint too fast.  So thank you.

 All right. Why wouldn't that be 

sufficient comparative evidence that someone

 else took this by mistake for overnight and kept

 it?

 MS. BIDWELL: That's exactly the 

problem with the Fifth Circuit rule, is that it 

wouldn't allow this kind of a comparator because 

the Fifth Circuit is parsing the rule so 

hypertechnically with such a high degree of 

specificity that somebody like a mayor would not 

be similarly situated to somebody like 

Ms. Gonzalez.  But --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why is that?  I 

don't understand that. 

MS. BIDWELL: Under the Fifth Circuit

their rule, if some other government official 

did the same thing, that would seem to be -- be 

useful evidence.

rule, just the fact that Ms. Gonzalez is a 

council member and Mayor Trevino is a mayor and

 they're serving different functions makes the

 Mayor not similarly situated to Ms. Gonzalez.

 And it is important to not just limit

 the objective evidence to comparators because, 

unlike equal protection cases, you could have

 situations with First Amendment violations where

 you can't point to a direct comparator.

nobody's ever arrested for jaywalking unless

 there's something fishy going on.  And to sort 

of pick one person and say, well, that's an 

adequate comparator, I think, really misses the

 whole point of Nieves.

 MS. BIDWELL: Your Honor, if we are

 limiting Nieves only to endemic crimes like

 jaywalking, then -- and mayors go on to this

 Nieves all-arrests rule, then the only people 

who could ever be sued for violations of First 

Amendment rights under the objective evidence 

carveout would be the police officers who are 

making those types of jaywalking decisions, and 

mayors and police chiefs who are not making 

those kind of difficult decisions on the spot 

would be exempt from it. 

So it is important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I 

mean, that's expanding the whole inquiry, right? 

I -- I mean, you're -- the part about the 

comparators in Nieves is sort of like a page and 

a half at the end.  There's a lot more that goes 

before us that explains why you do not normally 

allow this type -- kind of inquiry.

 Presented 1, we agree with the United States

blinding themselves to.  Even the Fifth 

Circuit's majority opinion said that we 

sympathize with Ms. Gonzalez, but we feel like 

Nieves obligates us to blind ourselves to 

evidence of causation, like the fact that two 

police officers looked into Ms. Gonzalez and 

thought there was nothing warranting an arrest, 

that a prosecutor dismissed the charges, that a 

special detective walked a warrant under an 

emergency procedure designed for fleeing 

suspects to put away a lady --

 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I was just going to 

ask you whether, on that point of looking at

 other evidence, would it be consistent with the 

Nieves exception to look at things other than

 comparators?  Let's -- let's say that I agree 

with you that the Fifth Circuit required too 

much of the comparator, too much specificity, 

maybe too much, you know, statistical evidence. 

But isn't the other kinds of evidence 

that you're looking at -- aren't those -- isn't 

that the kind of Mt. Healthy evidence that 

doesn't necessarily go to the probable cause 

inquiry? 

MS. BIDWELL: Your Honor, that goes to 

the definition of objective evidence in Nieves, 

and what we know from Nieves, on page 1722, the 

Court specifically explains that in Mt. Healthy, 

often motive alone is going to get you an 

inference of causation. 

And in cases like Nieves, motive alone 

is not going to get you an inference of 

causation.  It has to be something beyond 

subjective motive.  So, for example, here, if we

Trevino disliked Ms. Gonzalez because she

motive under Nieves is not going to qualify as

evidence, but, you know, this was and -- and 

forget about the differences between local and 

county and state for these purposes -- but I'm 

-- the crime is different?  This is kind of a 

random crime, you know, that she's charged with 

here. 

But you're saying that all of this 

evidence of retaliatory conduct can come in, 

which is the Mt. Healthy kind of evidence.  It's 

not so uncommon for people to be prosecuted for 

cheating on their taxes.  Would we be able to 

consider all -- doesn't that swallow the Nieves

 the crime changes and it's not kind of this 

random crime, you know, in random circumstances,

 but --

MS. BIDWELL: Right. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- she has the same 

long-running disputes, the same kind of other 

evidence, but the crime is more substantial. 

Your position is the same? 

MS. BIDWELL: Yes.  Our position is 

that the Court must be allowed to look at that 

evidence.  It doesn't mean that the Court is 

going to say, oh, you know what, it neutralizes 

probable cause and the plaintiff should be able 

to proceed. 

Our position is that the court should 

be allowed to look at it and then say, okay, 

maybe that's enough or maybe that's not enough. 

But the problem with the Fifth Circuit's rule is 

that it says you can't even look at any of that

 MS. BIDWELL: It -- it's -- it's not 

an offense-by-offense standard.  It's a standard 

of what did she do and then -- versus what kind 

of evidence she can provide and whether probable 

cause, given that context, tends to show that

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And I guess, on 

the fact pattern here, how are you going to have

 evidence that goes one way or the other?  I 

mean, the fact that no one's been prosecuted who

 stole a -- allegedly stole a document from the 

next person at the city council meetings, so I'm

 just curious what you think -- how this is going

 to proceed?  I mean, you look at the video,

 which I have, and, you know, you could come to 

one conclusion about this. 

MS. BIDWELL: It's -- in -- in -- in 

-- in that sense, it's similar to other statutes 

like child endangerment, for example, where you 

do have a serious crime, but you could have 

somebody like, I let my 13-year-old kid drive 

around the neighborhood on a bicycle, right, and 

if somebody is arresting me under the child 

endangerment statute, then it raises red flags. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But, if -- if --

if the conclusion is that someone intentionally 

-- the evidence suggests probable cause that 

someone intentionally stole a document that's a 

government document and did it with a motive 

because concerns have been raised about her role

video, and we know that stealing a government

 document is, in fact, a crime that's prosecuted,

 I guess --

MS. BIDWELL: Yes, Your Honor, two

 things for that.  Number one is that the statute 

is a general intent statute, so you don't need 

to be looking at her motives, why would she take 

a piece of paper from one side of the dais and 

put it on the other side of the dais. 

But even if --

Your Honor.  Even if you were to say that this

the concern I have here is the crime is a -- the 

offense is a serious offense, the offense

 itself.  The question's really whether the --

the facts of this case meet it.

 But, if you concluded that it met it,

 other people would be prosecuted for that too. 

The fact that there hasn't been someone else

 prosecuted just shows that, I suppose, you know, 

no one else in these circumstances has been 

accused of that or -- or they haven't found 

anyone.

in terms of concluding that it's retaliatory, I 

-- I think you have to show some evidence that

 she was singled out for -- under Nieves, singled

 out. I mean, Nieves is very specific about 

saying you need to identify similarly situated 

individuals not engaged in the same sort of

 protected speech had not been -- had not been

 arrested.

 MS. BIDWELL: And under the Seventh 

Circuit's rule, we would be able to point to the 

Mayor, and he would be a similarly situated 

individual.  And also under the Seventh Circuit 

rule, we would be able to point to the fact that 

two police officers independently looked into 

Ms. Gonzalez and decided there was nothing 

there, that the prosecutor looked into 

Ms. Gonzalez and decided not to pursue charges. 

And it also gets to this idea of how 

many crimes we have on the books today.  It 

would be one thing if you had 70 crimes.  It's 

another thing when you have 70 million crimes, 

and they are written in a broad manner.

 to say that she concealed a government record

wondering whether you're asking for what seems

Fifth Circuit is not sort of coming out of 

nowhere.  It does say objective evidence that he 

was arrested when otherwise similarly situated 

individuals not engaged in the same sort of 

protected speech had not been.  And I get that 

that would capture your mayor scenario, that --

capture the evidence of the two other 

prosecutors deciding not to prosecute, et

 cetera, et cetera.

 So are you asking for sort of an 

extension of the Nieves exception to cover that 

kind of evidence as well?

 MS. BIDWELL: Your Honor, we don't --

 we're not asking for an extension because we 

think that Nieves specifically articulates what 

the exception is concerned with. And it's a 

situation where probable cause will not tend to 

show that the arrest would not have happened had 

it not been for speech. 

And in that sense, objective 

evidence -- as the government argues, objective 

evidence of causation, irrespective of its form, 

should be allowed to come in.  And that's also 

the Seventh Circuit's point. 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  View of it, all 

right. So, if we -- if we take your view of it 

that we don't limit it to just that language, 

but we're looking at what was Nieves really 

about with respect to the exception and, 

therefore, allow all the kinds of evidence

going to be opening the floodgates to all sorts

 of vexatious litigation.  So maybe you can

 explain why that wouldn't be the case.

it wouldn't be the case is because of Chief

where, for him, one way to limit the floodgates 

was to introduce this very requirement of 

objective, that objective evidence of causation 

is something that makes it very difficult for 

plaintiff to be able to meet that standard. 

So, when you have probable cause on 

one side of the ledger, when you have warrant on 

one side of the ledger, then the kind of 

objective evidence of causation that you would 

have to present would have to be strong enough 

that a court would say that evidence of 

causation is a better explainer of what happened 

here than evidence of probable cause.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE F. REAVES

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

 MS. REAVES: Mr. Chief Justice, and

 may it please the Court:

 The first question presented is

 narrow, asking only what types of evidence can

 be used to satisfy the Nieves exception.  The 

Court need only address that discrete question 

and it should hold that the exception can be 

satisfied by various types of evidence that 

support the ultimate inference Nieves required, 

that similarly situated persons who did not 

engage in First Amendment activity would not 

have been arrested. 

Regardless of its form, evidence that 

supports that inference does what Nieves 

requires.  It addresses Hartman's causal concern 

by helping to establish that non-retaliatory 

grounds were, in fact, insufficient to provoke 

the adverse consequences. 

The Fifth Circuit, therefore, applied 

the wrong legal standard by effectively 

requiring Petitioner to show direct evidence of

           Respondents would eliminate the Nieves

 exception altogether for arrests involving

 warrants.  That unpreserved argument does not 

appear to have been accepted by any court of 

appeals and would draw unwarranted distinctions.

 On the flip side, Petitioner's 

approach to both questions presented would 

require the Court to essentially overrule Nieves 

and would draw lines between different 

categories of arrests that have no basis in the 

concerns that motivated the general cause -- no 

probable cause rule. 

I welcome the Court's questions.

Nieves exception.

 variety of different types of evidence in

 different situations.  So, for example, it could

 be a pattern of arrests for a behavior far

 afield of a plaintiff's.  It could be

 common-sense propositions or inferences, like

 jaywalking never happens.  It could be officers'

 employment of an unusual, irregular, or

 unnecessarily onerous arrest procedure, timing 

and events leading up to arrest and that an 

arrest was falsely documented. 

But I do think it's important that we 

don't think any of that evidence is necessarily 

sufficient in any particular case because the 

ultimate inference the evidence needs to support 

is that there would have been similarly situated 

people who were not, in fact, arrested. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  What would that look 

like in this case? 

MS. REAVES: So we haven't taken a 

position on the ultimate question in this case 

because we do think the Court just granted a 

question -- the question about the form of 

evidence, not whether the quantum of evidence 

here satisfies that or what the quantum of 

evidence is generally.

That being said, some types of 

evidence that are relevant in this case I do

 think are Petitioner's evidence that arrests for

 her -- for behavior -- her behavior -- for 

behavior under the statute were for behavior far

 afield of hers.

 The nature of the crime itself, it's a

 low-level misdemeanor crime that can be

 satisfied just by the general intent of moving 

the document. 

I think the irregular arrest 

procedures here are relevant as well. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Nieves, we 

-- the Court went through a long list of reasons 

why probable cause should generally, as we put 

it, defeat a retaliation claim, and we described 

the qualification there as -- as a narrow one. 

You had a long list of the type of 

evidence that should come in to defeat the 

retaliation claim.  It seems to me to be 

inconsistent with the notion of a very strong 

general rule that had been well-established and 

a very narrow exception.

because I think that evidence still has to

 person wouldn't have been arrested.

 And I don't think the form of

 evidence, as long as it's objective, whether

 that's direct statistical comparators or other

 evidence that supports an inference that others 

wouldn't have been arrested, changes kind of the

 concerns that this Court identified in Nieves

 when it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but, I 

mean, the -- the --

MS. REAVES: -- adopted the general no 

probable cause rule. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seemed to 

me that your -- your -- your list suggests that 

this is a normal, typical question.  There's a 

debate about it.  We're going to have evidence 

on both sides of all sorts of different types 

and then figure it out. 

And that doesn't seem to me to take 

into account the reasons that we have the 

general rule that probable cause is enough. It 

just seems to take it in the same area as any --

any disputed issue of fact in general. 

MS. REAVES: I don't think that --

sort of stuff would not be admissible as

because the ultimate inference is the similarly 

situated inquiry, which is a way I think we

 actually differ from Petitioners on the first

 question presented, I think that the -- this 

sort of evidence, it -- it's going to depend on 

the case whether it supports that inference. 

Just a standalone allegation that I was arrested 

and it --

but I'm trying to get out of it, you seem to say 

you're not expanding the exception and you have

but you would say, oh, that doesn't come in 

because we're concerned about maintaining the

it's not part of a Monell pattern or practice

 claim doesn't either support the similarly 

situated inference and it -- you know, it -- but 

it might be able to come in if you were just 

doing some sort of Mt. Healthy analysis like 

Petitioner is requesting as part of the second

 question presented.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Can I ask you about

 the other question presented?  You have a 

footnote, Footnote 6, about abuse of process. 

And I -- I'm struggling to understand why abuse 

of process wouldn't relevantly inform our 

understanding of Section 1983 if one believes 

that abuse of process was a recognized tort at 

the time of the statute's adoption, which I 

think the evidence tends to support. 

So I understand in Nieves that that 

may not have been relevant, in part because it 

was in -- a warrantless arrest, so there was no 

process involved, and also in part because, 

frankly, Mr. Nieves's complaint didn't allege an 

ulterior motive that might satisfy an abuse of 

process claim, right?  It did -- it didn't have 

an allegation that he was being extorted in the 

way that we have that kind of allegation here.

Why should the Court turn a blind eye 

to abuse of process as a common law tort 

analogue, which we usually look to common law

 tort analogues when interpreting 1983?

 MS. REAVES: So I have three points on

 that, Justice Gorsuch.  First is I do think that 

Petitioner chose to plead her claim here as a

 retaliatory arrest claim, and this Court did 

hold in Nieves that --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yes. But, when we 

look at whether it's retaliation in violation of 

the First Amendment or any other amendment, we 

-- we look to the common law analogues, and here 

is an obvious one. 

MS. REAVES: Well, I think that Nieves 

largely foreclosed that because --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that's what 

I'm asking you.  Do you think it really 

foreclosed it? Because it didn't mention it. 

And, again, it wasn't pled.  And there was no 

process.  And there wasn't the kind of extortion 

that's alleged here.  So there are lots of 

reasons why Nieves didn't grapple with this

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But here we are.

 MS. REAVES: -- let me start with 

Nieves and then kind of turn to the merits of

 that question.

 The reason why we think the Nieves

 Court was aware of this is because the Court in 

Hartman discussed abuse of process, declined to 

rely on it. The government in its Nieves brief, 

page 10, Footnote 2, discussed abuse of process 

and explained why it wasn't most relevant. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Again, I agree with 

you, it wasn't relevant in Hartman and wasn't 

relevant in Nieves.  But why isn't it relevant 

here? 

MS. REAVES: So a couple of points on 

that. First of all, I think, if you look at an 

abuse of process claim, the kind of prototypical 

claim was use of process to extort money or 

property.  Here --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or -- or any other 

kind of favor or -- or thing.  And -- and -- and 

why -- why -- it -- it doesn't -- it wasn't 

limited to property and money.  Often it was, 

you're right.  But I've actually litigated abuse 

of process claims, and the -- the point is the

process, yes, it was supported and it -- it was

 properly done.  The magistrate here signed off 

on it, but it was being done for an ulterior

 purpose.  And I think that's the allegation

 here.

 MS. REAVES: I think, though, that the 

-- kind of the ordering of the claim doesn't fit

 on as well as a malicious prosecution or false 

arrest claim. So, here, the retaliation was in 

-- the retaliatory arrest was in retaliation for 

her prior First Amendment conduct. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well --

MS. REAVES: And that's what you have 

to plead to plead a retaliatory arrest claim. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- a -- a -- a false 

arrest or a malicious prosecution claim says 

there's no probable cause.  That -- that's at 

the heart of it, okay, that the arrest couldn't 

lawfully be made. 

Here, she's saying, yeah, the arrest 

could be lawfully made, but it wasn't being made 

for the right -- it wasn't being made for the 

true reasons that the writ was designed for --

MS. REAVES: Right.

ulterior purpose, to push me out of the

 political process and silence me.

 MS. REAVES: To be fair, she pleaded a

 retaliatory arrest claim, so that's arrest and

 retaliation for her prior conduct.  She's 

brought in allegations that there was also 

future intent, but that's not part of the claim

 itself. 

And, second, I think it would be odd 

for the Court --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, if I read it 

differently, then what? 

MS. REAVES: So I think, just stepping 

back a little bit, I think it would be 

irregular, in light of the rationales this Court 

has identified, to carve off the three sets of 

claims in different ways that I think are at 

issue here. 

So, first, there's retaliatory 

prosecution.  The general no probable cause bar 

applies.  There's also a split-second arrest. 

Petitioner agrees the general no probable cause 

rule applies there. 

In the middle, the Court would look to

a different analogy, and I don't think that 

analogy is justified by the rationales this

 Court has articulated for the no probable cause

 rule, which are that probable cause will always 

be relevant and readily available and evidence 

of it or lack thereof, and, second, that there 

may be causal difficulties caused by multiple

 actors or the propriety of considering speech in

 certain situations. 

And this category of more deliberative 

arrests that Petitioner is carving out isn't 

different on those kind of key issues that 

motivated the exception.  So that's why I think 

the Court should continue to look to malicious 

prosecution and false arrest.

 evidence that anybody has been arrested for 

committing the crime in that particular way? 

How do you think a court should deal with that?

 MS. REAVES: So that evidence, 

standing alone, is not going to be enough to 

demonstrate that there were similarly situated

 people who engaged in the same sort of activity 

who were not arrested.

 So I think that evidence could 

potentially be relevant if there are other 

reasons to infer that there were, in fact, 

similarly situated people and they were not 

arrested, but the novelty of a crime alone is 

not enough to make the similarly situated 

showing. 

I think there are a lot of good 

reasons for that.  We articulate some in our 

brief, but that includes the fact that just 

because someone figures out a new way to engage 

in criminal activity doesn't suggest there's 

anything nefarious by a government prosecuting 

that.

understanding you right, on the first question

 presented, your position is that the Fifth 

Circuit is the only circuit that's demanding a

 specific kind of comparison-based evidence,

 correct?

 MS. REAVES: That's correct.  We think

 the Fifth Circuit applied too strict a form of

 evidence requirement.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if I remember 

correctly, the Fifth Circuit blamed it on the 

language in Nieves and said that Nieves 

compelled this conclusion but that they were 

sympathetic, that Judge Oldham's view of it 

being a little wide -- wider than they're 

applying it is consistent with the Ninth and 

Seventh Circuit, correct? 

MS. REAVES: That's correct, yes.  I 

-- I'm not sure that we agree with the Fifth 

Circuit. We don't take our position to be any 

expansion on Nieves, just --

view today, correct?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Have you seen an

 explosion of litigation with retaliatory --

 Lozman-type retaliatory arrest exceptions?

 MS. REAVES: We haven't done a

 statistical analysis on that.  Obviously, Nieves

 did not -- was not decided very long ago. You 

know, that being said, I think, if you look at

 the decisions in the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, 

such as the Ballentine decision in the Ninth 

Circuit, they very carefully looked at the types 

of evidence we've discussed but ultimately 

looked at that inference of whether that 

suggests that similarly situated persons would 

not have been arrested. 

So I do think that they struck the 

balance between applying the Nieves rule but 

just allowing a broader range of evidence to 

satisfy it than the Fifth Circuit did below.

right, that an allegation of a subjective state

 of mind on the police officer is going to get 

you past the probable cause bar. Is that

 correct?

 MS. REAVES: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's -- that's --

that's an obvious implication of -- I mean not

 just an implication.  Nieves makes that quite

 clear. 

Now, on the other side of the 

spectrum, you have this quite obviously 

comparative evidence.  The Fifth Circuit seemed 

to have a very narrow view of what that was, 

like you have to point to a particular person 

who wasn't arrested. 

But let's expand that a little bit 

more and say, well, that would be a little bit 

nutty. I mean, if you come in and you say 

nobody's ever been arrested for that, I can't 

point to a particular person, but, look, 

nobody's ever been arrested for that, that 

should count too, right?  So -- so -- so, you 

know, that's all, like, very comparative stuff,

is where I thought your brief was interesting --

is objective evidence that you might take to 

support an inference as to comparisons with 

other people but that is not on its face very

 comparative in nature.

 And I'll just read you some of what

 you said in your brief.  The timing of and 

events leading up to a plaintiff's arrest, the

 history of the defendant's interactions with the 

plaintiffs, the fact that officers falsely 

documented the arrest.  Maybe the most 

comparative of these is the employment of an 

unusual, irregular, or unnecessarily onerous 

arrest procedure. 

So all of these, you can understand 

how somebody could argue from them to a 

comparative statement that another person who 

didn't make these kinds -- who didn't engage in 

this kind of speech activity wouldn't have been 

treated the same way, but it is a little bit of 

an inferential jump. 

And so I guess my long-winded question 

is, why do you put those sorts of statements in 

the bucket that should be able to come in to get 

past the probable cause bar rather than lump

them with allegations of subjective intent on 

the part of the police officer?

 MS. REAVES: Well, I think there are

 four of -- it makes sense to put them in the

 bucket of things that courts can consider, first

 of all, because courts generally aren't limited 

in the form of evidence they can rely on to 

consider inferences. And I think, in particular 

here, any objective evidence is going to go to 

addressing Hartman's causal concerns by helping 

to establish that non-retaliatory grounds were, 

in fact, insufficient to provoke adverse 

consequences. 

So, if, for example, the method of 

arrest is entirely unique, let's say it's the 

facts of this case and we also know that no one 

has ever been arrested and sat in jail for 

having -- for engaging in a misdemeanor, that 

does support the inference that not only 

similarly situated people were not arrested but 

also that this person was really treated 

differently from similarly situated persons 

across the board. 

Now, again, that evidence alone isn't 

enough, but it can help tell the whole story of

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice

 Gorsuch?

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Just to be clear,

 we're not talking about the causation standard

 under the First Amendment itself, right?  We're 

talking about this Court's gloss on what the 

causation requirement is statutorily under 1983, 

right? 

MS. REAVES: That's correct.  We read 

Nieves and Hartman to be elements of the causes 

of action, not elements of the First Amendment 

itself. 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So the First 

Amendment may well be broader than this.  It's 

just that this Court has said, for purposes of a 

statute, we're going to require more specific 

kinds of evidence, right? 

MS. REAVES: That's absolutely 

correct, and that's why we argued in our brief 

that the Court should actually make that clear 

at some point in one of these cases.

you're looking for, right, is evidence that 

suggests that other people who did what this 

person is alleged to have done wouldn't have 

been arrested and that this person was arrested 

because of her political viewpoint or particular

 speech or political expressive activities.

 Does that sound right so far?

the second part would come in more under the Mt. 

Healthy inquiry after you get through the

correct, Justice.

sorry to focus on the facts here, but this is an

some crime that was never prosecuted and was 

like, yeah, you did it by accident, but we're 

going to prosecute you anyway, okay, that sounds 

highly unusual and you can't find other people 

who would have done that.

exists here or not -- if you have probable cause

 that someone intentionally stole government

 documents, intentionally, knowingly, 

intentionally, to impair a government 

investigation or proceeding, I mean, that's 

going to be prosecuted all the time, right?

 MS. REAVES: I agree with that,

 Justice Kavanaugh.  I think --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Exactly. 

MS. REAVES: -- the distinction here, 

though, is we agree with Petitioner that the 

only intent required is general intent.  So the 

only intent she -- the government had to prove 

here was that she picked up the document and 

intentionally moved it. 

So I think, because of that, that's 

why this was prosecuted as a misdemeanor.  And 

if you want evidence for why it is just general 

intent, you can look at Texas Penal Code 6.03. 

You can look at the treatise that Petitioner 

cites in her reply.  And so I do think that's 

why this particular case does fit within the 

heartland of the Nieves exception.

 serious/non-serious crime distinction which 

probably would be along a misdemeanor/felony

 line. It just seems that this case clearly

 falls in the misdemeanor bucket.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And are you

 looking at the -- I mean, now we're going back 

to the law in question rather than the facts,

 but I think the idea was someone who committed 

these facts -- who engaged in these activities 

would not be prosecuted but for their speech. 

And if they could -- they're 

prosecuted under the general intent, but if 

their activities, if the police officer believes 

this was done to prevent inquiries into which 

names were on the petition because there were 

allegations the day before that she had coerced 

or misled people into signing the petition --

again, I'm not taking a position on any of that. 

I mean, I don't know that you wouldn't 

be -- the inference would be you would be 

prosecuted under some statute, even if it is "a 

general intent" statute, isn't that right?

than the potential charge, the relevant 

comparator would be other similarly situated

 persons and whether there was probable cause.

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Who engaged in

 those facts?

 MS. REAVES: Who engaged in the same 

activity, yes. I do think that's the relevant

 inquiry.  Just because someone is charged with a 

lower crime or arrested for a lower crime, you 

know, doesn't kind of change the analysis as far 

as similarly situated goes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Right.  And the 

whole case here -- yeah.  Okay.  Thank you. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  I'd like to pick up 

there. So how important is the seriousness of 

the crime? 

I -- I said before, and I think 

Justice Kavanaugh is right to be more precise 

about this, so this is kind of a random prime --

crime, but it's random because of the facts of 

the case and it was a misdemeanor. 

So, you know, jaywalking, the example 

in Nieves for the exception, I mean, jaywalking,

someone or darted in front of a car, jaywalking

 is not serious.

 Does it matter at all? I mean, do we 

look at the facts? Do we look at the crime? 

And before we even get into the Nieves exception 

and looking at the kind of evidence that you're

 proposing, do we do some sort of threshold 

analysis about whether the facts or the crime or 

both are actually serious? 

MS. REAVES: So I think, under the 

Nieves exception, I do think it's similarly 

situated persons would have been arrested.  I 

don't think it necessarily matters what crime or 

what level of seriousness of crime was listed on 

the warrant or was listed on, you know, the 

officer's notes.  So I do think it's a 

conduct-based comparison. 

I don't think the Court needs to 

address the seriousness question here 

necessarily because this is a misdemeanor crime, 

but we would have no objection to the Court 

drawing a felony/misdemeanor distinction and 

just saying that Nieves doesn't apply outside of 

that, and I think that's because -- and that

could be appropriate because Nieves did seem to 

be concerned about endemic crimes that are 

infrequently prosecuted, where there's a large

 amount of discretion.

 And from the federal government's

 perspective, where we see the most types of

 problematic and potentially retaliatory arrests 

are in situations like unlawful assembly, 

blocking a sidewalk, disorderly conduct, 

trespassing on government property, and those 

things tend to be low-level endemic offenses 

where there's a lot of discretion. 

JUSTICE BARRETT:  That's true, 

although the line between misdemeanor and felony 

is drawn in different places in different 

jurisdictions, and it would be pretty hard, I 

think, to -- to hold that as a consistent line. 

So, when you say similarly situated, 

you're saying that you look both at conduct and 

at crime, but the federal government doesn't 

have a position about whether we look at the 

seriousness of the crime?

seriousness of the crime goes, even if you don't

if you decide not to draw some sort of strong

 generally play out is, when you have a felony or 

a more serious crime, there's just going to be a 

presumption that people are regularly prosecuted 

for that, and it's going to be very easy to find

compelling objective basis for inferring that 

the arrest was retaliatory.

 But then you seem to accept numbers or 

different kinds of forms of evidence that don't

 in my view necessarily go directly to 

determining that a similarly situated person was

 treated differently.

 So how -- I guess Justice Kagan put it 

that there are sort of several inferences to get 

you from certain kinds of evidence to a 

similarly situated person. 

So can you say more about why, for 

example, the government was -- wouldn't be 

insisting that the plaintiff in this case at 

least say something about this having happened 

before, that there are similarly situated 

people? 

I mean, I find it difficult -- and I'm 

not saying you're wrong. I'm just trying to 

puzzle it out. You say, you know, evidence that 

an arrest has never happened before.  I mean, 

surely that's common sense.  But I guess I'm 

trying to understand how, unless we have 

evidence that this same kind of thing happened 

before, we can take that evidence and say that's

an inference that -- of the kind that you're

 trying to draw.

 MS. REAVES: So I think you're either

 going to need to have evidence or you're going

 to need to have an inference that similarly 

situated people engaged in the same sort of

 activity and were not arrested.  We just don't 

think there needs to be direct evidence of that. 

And I think, for example --

JUSTICE JACKSON:  If your only 

evidence was that this never happened before, 

would you also require a plaintiff to show -- I 

mean, the arrest, excuse me, never happened 

before, no one was arrested for this conduct, 

would you also require the plaintiff to show 

that other people had engaged in this conduct? 

MS. REAVES: So the plaintiff would 

either need to show that or would need to 

show -- you know, not directly show that, not 

direct -- have direct evidence of that, but a 

plaintiff could have evidence that supports that 

inference or there could be a common-sense 

inference.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Throughout history, probable cause has 

foreclosed retaliatory arrest suits.  Nieves 

created one narrow exception for warrantless 

arrests, where officers typically look away or 

give warnings or tickets.  This Court should not 

blow up that exception. 

First, this case involves a warrant. 

Warrants do not entail the boundless officer 

discretion that justified the Nieves exception

in the first place. Warrants also deter abuse 

by inviting judicial scrutiny, and warrants add 

intervening actors that make it even less likely 

that animus caused the arrest. At a minimum, 

warrants are the last place to widen the Nieves

 exception.

 Second, this case involves theft.  For 

crimes such as theft, where officers typically

 arrest, the justification for the Nieves 

exception just doesn't exist.  It is only where 

officers rarely arrest that probable cause loses 

its probative force.  Extending the exception to 

everything from theft to terrorism just invites 

questions about why police arrested some people 

and not others. 

Third, Petitioner never alleged 

comparators, i.e., others who engaged in similar 

conduct but were not arrested.  Only comparators 

rule out the probative value of probable cause. 

Petitioner and the government would allow anyone 

to sue with objective evidence of animus or 

using so-called negative evidence, the absence 

of arrest for similar conduct.

dismiss and on to discovery and before a jury. 

Plaintiffs will always contest the police 

version of events and then point to the -- the 

lack of arrest records for their reframed

 conduct.  Take this case:  The complaint alleges 

Petitioner accidentally misplaced papers and 

denies that Petitioner acted intentionally, but 

the warrant application recounts a case of

 serious intentional theft. 

Now Petitioner was free to challenge 

probable cause, but, instead, she admitted it. 

And if you accept Petitioner's gamesmanship, 

those arrested for domestic violence will claim 

the victim just slipped, those arrested for 

threats will claim they were just joking, and 

those arrested for embezzlement will claim they 

just accidentally misplaced the funds. 

I welcome questions. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  I, of course, agreed 

with you in Nieves, with what you just said, but 

we've crossed that bridge.  And you've heard a 

discussion of what kind of evidence would be 

necessary to counter the causal connection or to 

-- to -- to change it, to overcome probable 

cause determination or the warrant.

What would be some of your responses 

to some of the arguments that you have heard for

 the type of evidence?  For -- what I'm

 concerned -- interested in, for example, is --

and there are rare cases where crimes are rarely

 punished and that you could have the exact same

 argument.  What kind of evidence would you use 

in a case like that to counter the probable

 cause? 

MS. BLATT: Yeah, I think if -- the 

way I read Nieves, as the narrow exception that 

the Court said it was, it should be easy to 

plead the exception because it's talking about 

cases where people actually engage in the 

conduct but officers give a ticket or a citation 

or a warning or they look away. 

And you just don't have that kind of 

case. The Court was talking about jaywalking, 

dog off a leash, eating on the subway, not 

wearing a seatbelt, not cases where the 

assumption is, when there is probable cause if 

officers typically arrest, and I just think that 

that is per se true with theft, and it's the 

opposite presumption is true with crimes where 

you can get a ticket. No one gets a ticket for

to take it to any crime goes and misdemeanors in 

Texas are punishable but -- by up to a year in 

jail, you will have every case where the 

plaintiff, like in this case, says you have to 

accept my allegations as true, which I did 

nothing wrong. 

And then the officers -- thank God we 

here had a warrant, but if there wasn't a 

warrant, you will not hear the officers' version 

of events.  The only reason you heard the 

officers' side of the story, as in Nieves, was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, you're 

characterizing this as a theft, as -- and the

 assumption of Justice Kavanaugh was the same. 

But the government's pointing out, and I think 

rightly, that this wasn't charged as a theft 

because theft would have a defense of there was 

no intention to permanently deprive someone. 

There's a whole series of things. 

The crime that was charged here was a 

crime of moving a document, and -- and all it 

required was a general intent to move it.  The 

defense was, I didn't -- I did it accidentally. 

She may have been defeated in that or not. 

But the point is that there are 

charges brought for stealing government 

documents and there are charges that are brought 

for moving government documents. And that's 

never happened in a situation like this.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So my point is 

you're building it up on the facts of the case

 to characterize it as something that wasn't the

 charge.  And I think what the government is 

saying is, for this kind of misdemeanor that was 

charged, it doesn't happen when there's a

 dispute about whether something was moved

 intentionally or not.

 I'd go a step further having been a 

former prosecutor.  Even if it was intentional, 

we probably wouldn't have brought the charges 

because no harm, no foul, no harm. 

MS. BLATT: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And, in fact, two 

police officers wouldn't charge it, one public 

prosecutor didn't charge it.  In the end, even 

with a warrant, the charges were dropped.  This 

is just not the kind of situation like in the 

jaywalking example --

MS. BLATT: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- with -- when 

there's a dispute about things like this, people 

are not arrested in this way.

 MS. BLATT: Mm-hmm.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you're 

characterizing it differently, but that's the 

bottom line of this claim.

 MS. BLATT: So -- so at least four 

responses. One, there was no charge here. 

There was an arrest, and the arrest warrant

 three times says the opposite of what you just 

said. It said the video clearly shows Gonzalez 

intentionally concealing and removing a petition 

from custody.  Page 49, "There is no mistake 

Gonzalez knows what she is holding."  She's 

holding the petition.  At warrant page 53, I'm 

charging her for meeting the elements of the 

statute because she had a desire to 

intentionally remove and impair the availability 

of this document from city custody. 

Now, on the statute, I'm shocked by 

the government because the government has its 

own parallel, 18 U.S.C. 2071, that is the same 

tampering statute.  All states have a tampering 

statute, and they all read the same way with 

intent.  Now they cite the treatise, but the 

treatise she didn't cite was the section on

 reversed.  That her complaint alleges -- again,

you talking about this at a certain level of 

specificity, and I'm trying to understand what 

your view is of what she should have said in

 order to satisfy the rule and whether the rule 

should be as the Fifth Circuit lays it out.

 MS. BLATT: So -- so the plaintiff has 

two choices, and she could have had two choices 

here. She could have at least said I'll allege

 a comparator.  This statute -- I'm not going to 

challenge probable cause or this statute, but it 

covers completely innocent conduct.  And I'm 

going to allege people always engage in innocent 

conduct and don't get arrested. 

And then you and I or we would have 

been having a fight with, well, can you look at 

the comparators from the complaint or shouldn't 

you look at the comparators? 

JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, for you, it's 

not enough to say no one has ever been arrested 

the for this kind -- doing this kind of thing 

before? 

MS. BLATT: No, because it's that --

it's so much easier to say, and people do it. 

Here are the reasons why the government said 

this, but they forgot what they said on page 20

of which are hardly ever enforced? Last I read, 

there were over 300,000 federal crimes --

 Amendment and that's not actionable?

otherwise, but I have to try to do that.

 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah.  I'd like --

 MS. BLATT: Okay.  So it's -- well, 

let me just try this, Justice Gorsuch.  If it's 

never been enforced, then just say, people do 

it. If there's a statute that makes it illegal 

to commit adultery, it's not that hard to say I 

-- I've committed adultery or my neighbors 

committed adultery. 

If the statute -- if -- let's just put 

it -- and, again, the government tells you on 

page 20 of its brief the fact that the statute 

has never been enforced could prove little or 

nothing. 

And here are four reasons why.  Maybe 

no one commits the crime.  Maybe you don't see 

carjacking in Amish country.  Maybe you don't 

see people stealing boats in Death Valley. 

Maybe people commit -- the crime itself is

 Court could take into consideration in doing a

 but-for causation analysis.  If -- if -- if you 

really think that there's a case in Amish 

country and there's no carjacking, the Court can 

say that evidence is not enough.

 But you're saying that -- that a court 

can't even look at that evidence, the fact that

 was actually denied.  And Judge Oldham said --

 Amendment issue.  Judge Oldham said he's not so 

sure how he would rule on qualified immunity.

 But we're happy to win on qualified

 immunity, but we actually lost it here. And the

 Court in Nieves could have done the same thing. 

Generally, you want to keep it so officers 

aren't afraid of being sued.

no, but she says, well, it's the normal

 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- Justice 

Gorsuch's question because I think that's

 important.  And maybe I'm looking at it the 

wrong way, but I assume people who intentionally 

engage in this conduct are prosecuted all the

 time, generally speaking, namely, intentionally 

stealing government documents, intentionally 

removing government documents, et cetera. 

MS. BLATT: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Intentionally 

obstructing government proceedings.  People who 

accidentally take a document are -- are never 

prosecuted presumably, put aside what crimes. 

For example -- I think the government said look 

at the conduct, not the crime. 

MS. BLATT: We agree. 

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So how do we 

assess that at this stage when they're alleging 

they did it unintentionally and they would have 

a good case if that were, in fact, true, but the 

police officer said there's probable cause that 

she did it intentionally.  She intentionally

 MS. BLATT: Well, you wanted --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Because I think 

Justice Gorsuch's question goes -- is correct if 

it's unintentional, but I'm -- I don't think

 it's correct if it's intentional.

 MS. BLATT: So the in the weeds is 

that's why you need comparators, but at a higher

 level, it is why we're making the argument that 

this will happen in every case if you extend it 

beyond cases where police don't typically arrest 

because every assault case will be I was -- you 

know, every looting case will be I didn't -- I 

took a toothbrush or I -- you know, I don't know 

how that -- that ring got in my bag, or I left 

the party as soon as the cocaine came, and the 

officer will say, you know, no, I saw you with 

it. 

And we'll be debating, I -- I don't 

know, I think half of you will say that should 

go to a jury and half of you think this is not a 

good idea for officers.  How can they kind of 

enforce the law in this type of environment? 

I would say, if you're going to do 

comparators, you have to look at the comparators

that's alleged in the warrant application.  The 

problem is you might not have a warrant 

application in all kinds of cases. If it's a 

warrantless arrest, all you're going to have is

 the complaint, and the complaint says, I'm

 innocent.

unlawful assembly and those kinds of crimes,

intentionally gathered, you intentionally

is Nieves. That is the hard core of that should 

be easy to allege, and we agree with a lot of 

the government's examples about comparators. 

You can use yourself as a comparator on a 

previous occasion.  If you're the only 

journalist arrested for assembly, that kind of 

stuff, I thought that was the point of Nieves. 

That should -- should go.

point of Nieves was, if you have solid objective 

evidence that you're in a world in which you 

were arrested for something that somebody who 

hadn't engaged in your speech activities would 

not be arrested for, that you should be able to 

present that evidence to get over the probable 

cause bar.

Suppose that there were two videos in this case.

can get back at Ms. Gonzalez, and they say:

good objective evidence to get you over the

I'm suggesting is that the point -- look, the

 point of this probable cause bar is we don't

look at -- but, if you have solid objective 

evidence that you were being treated differently 

from another person in your situation, that that 

solid objective evidence should -- and part of 

that might be comparative in the way that you're 

suggesting, but -- but there might be other 

things too. 

MS. BLATT: I -- I mean, the problem 

is this is a poster child. There is absolutely 

nothing in the complaint that suggests that 

either the chief of police or this police

specifically ruled out.  And the Court, I think, 

said very clearly only comparator evidence. 

Once you have a similarly situated person who's 

not engaged in speech --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, look, you don't 

have to -- from my videotape, you do not have to 

make a very long leap of inference to say:  Oh, 

that's comparative.  You know, this videotape is

sorry. Maybe I misunderstood your hypo.  Isn't

 it only because there's a videotape of the

 officer's statements?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's -- it's --

it's -- it's -- it's pretty clear, objective

 evidence that a judge can look at, which makes 

it clear that Ms. Gonzalez was picked on because 

she was doing what the First Amendment allows

 her to do. 

MS. BLATT: I worry that if you write 

an opinion that says only that evidence is okay 

if you've got the officer on videotape, that's 

fine. I worry where you're going is anything 

that I as a judge think is pretty relevant that 

she was picked on.  That's what scares me, and 

that's what scares me representing police 

officers, who literally, you know, are trying to 

work to get the community to trust them and do 

their job and don't, you know, have smear 

campaigns every time they're sued.  It's -- it's

absence of the videotape would be important if

frail, elderly person who weighs 90 pounds and 

is arrested for assaulting the officer because

latter situation and is charged with assault.

pled it, could have been anyone who

So, in your -- again, I would never

will be: I just elbowed, everyone else was 

punching, and I was the only one arrested.  But 

assuming it's going to do assault, it's easy to

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANYA A. BIDWELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. BIDWELL: I have four points to 

make. 

So first point is I think it's very 

important to look at the two questions presented 

in context of each other.  So, if you are saying 

that Nieves covers the vast bulk of cases, which 

are the cases where police officers are making 

on-the-spot arrests, for example, during 

protests, during art event festivals, when they 

are responding to domestic violence calls, 

that's the vast bulk of police cases. 

If you say that Nieves only covers 

that, then when you talk about objective 

evidence carveout, the -- the exact example of a 

comparator might actually make sense because

then you can have a comparator, for example, on 

-- during a protest. 

But, if you are including mayors into

 the general Nieves police arrest framework, that

 it is very important that objective evidence 

carveout is not just limited to examples of 

non-arrest, especially, as Respondent argues, 

they say we should have irrebuttable presumption 

with warrants. So then mayors get an 

irrebuttable presumption with warrants, and the 

only people who are going to be sued for First 

Amendment retaliation will be police officers 

protesting events under the endemic crime 

similarly situated exception. 

So it's important to keep those two 

perspectives in terms of Question Presented 1 

and Question Presented 2.
