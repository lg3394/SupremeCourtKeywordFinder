HO\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\\n\\n MS. HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, \\n\\nand may it please the Court: \\n\\nIf anyone is a party in interest \\n\\nentitled to be heard in this Chapter 11 case, \\n\\nit\\'s the insurer, Truck, who will pay virtually \\n\\nevery dollar the debtors owe the asbestos \\n\\nclaimants. \\n\\nYet, the Fourth Circuit\\'s rule denies \\n\\nthat insurer a voice.  That rule, which my \\n\\nfriends barely defend, violates the text, \\n\\ncontext, and history of 1109(b). \\n\\nIt also defies the practical reality \\n\\nthat Chapter 11 cases are, as this Court has \\n\\nrecognized, collaborative, working best when all \\n\\nstakeholders come together at the outset to hash \\n\\nthings out. \\n\\nCongress recognized that reality and \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                   \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n1   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5   \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7   \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9   \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n5\\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n spoke expansively in 1109(b) to extend the right\\n\\n to be heard to any issue.  Congress also gave \\n\\ncourts a duty to ensure compliance with the code \\n\\nand invited broad participation to help\\n\\n discharge that duty.  1109(b)\\'s breadth is a \\n\\nfeature, not a bug.\\n\\n It\\'s now common ground that a party in \\n\\ninterest is one who could be directly and\\n\\n adversely affected by the case.  That\\'s Truck in \\n\\nat least two ways. \\n\\nFirst, it\\'s the insurer paying the \\n\\nvast bulk of claims against the debtors.  In the \\n\\ngovernment\\'s terms, it\\'s a contracting party. \\n\\nFrom the start then, Truck\\'s rights could have \\n\\nbeen directly and adversely affected by this \\n\\ncase. The proof of that pudding is in the plan \\n\\nfinding, which resolved key -- a key coverage \\n\\ndispute against Truck. \\n\\nSecond, Truck\\'s a creditor for \\n\\nmillions in insurance deductibles. \\n\\nFor both reasons, 1109(b)\\'s plain \\n\\nterms entitle Truck to be heard on any issue. \\n\\nIn silencing Truck, the Fourth Circuit \\n\\nviolated those terms by limiting who a party in \\n\\ninterest is and what issues they can raise. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                   \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                          \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n1   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n7   \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9   \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15  \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17    \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19  \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25  \\n\\n6\\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nI welcome the Court\\'s questions.\\n\\n JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Ho, at what point \\n\\ndo you determine the status of party in\\n\\n interest? \\n\\nMS. HO: Thank you, Justice Thomas.\\n\\n At the -- at the outset. Section 1109(b)\\'s text\\n\\n refers to \"be heard under any issue in [this] \\n\\ncase.\" So we think that has to be an ex ante \\n\\ninquiry, in part because there are other \\n\\nprovisions of the code apart from 1109(b) that \\n\\naffect parties in interest that don\\'t depend on \\n\\na specific plan or any plan. \\n\\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the -- in this \\n\\ncase, the -- the determination at the end or --\\n\\nor in -- was that Truck was not negatively \\n\\naffected.  How could you determine that at the \\n\\n-- at the beginning of the proceedings? \\n\\nMS. HO: Yes, Your Honor, because I \\n\\nthink the question should be \"could,\" could --\\n\\ncould the entity be affected by the Chapter 11 \\n\\ncase. And as the insurer, there are any number \\n\\nof ways that Truck could have been affected.

HO: But that is different than \\n\\nbeing heard, Mr. Chief Justice. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah.

Maybe you just, \\n\\nyou know, don\\'t know what the effect is going to \\n\\nbe, and a lot of people who could be parties in \\n\\ninterest, just because it doesn\\'t fit into the \\n\\n-- it doesn\\'t make rational economic sense, they \\n\\ndon\\'t participate, right?

But there are other requirements for \\n\\na plan.  For instance, a plan needs to be \\n\\nfeasible. So, if you\\'re a creditor and the plan \\n\\nproposes satisfying everything, but it satisfies \\n\\nit in a way that\\'s not likely to end up being \\n\\nimplemented -- you can object under 1129(a), I \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n  \\n\\n1   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n3   \\n\\n4   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8   \\n\\n9   \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15    \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18   \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23  \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25 \\n\\n32\\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nthink it\\'s (a)(11), that the plan\\'s not\\n\\n feasible.\\n\\n So the impairment just talks about the\\n\\n separate requirement that the classes vote.

So, if they can \\n\\nbe heard on the plan finding or if they\\'re a \\n\\ncreditor, I guess I don\\'t understand why, on the \\n\\ntext of that provision, they can be so limited \\n\\nand say, well, you can\\'t bring up anything else, \\n\\neven though the -- the text says \"any issue.\" \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t limit it in that way. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n                                                                  \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n1   \\n\\n2   \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4   \\n\\n5   \\n\\n6   \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8   \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10  \\n\\n11  \\n\\n12  \\n\\n13  \\n\\n14  \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16  \\n\\n17  \\n\\n18  \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20  \\n\\n21  \\n\\n22  \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24  \\n\\n25  \\n\\n56\\n\\nOfficial \\n\\nMR.

And you have to get through \\n\\nthat to get to the merits.\\n\\n So, as an insurer, nothing about the \\n\\nplan finding changes whether or not Truck is a \\n\\nparty in interest.  They\\'re not.

FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief \\n\\nJustice, and may it please the Court: \\n\\nThere are a number of questions I\\'d \\n\\nlike to address that you posed this morning, but \\n\\nI want to start with one principle, which is \\n\\nthat the Bankruptcy Code was not intended to \\n\\nprotect insurers, except in a couple of places \\n\\nwhere asbestos-related trusts are created, those \\n\\nare in Section 524(g) principally, but in 109, \\n\\nCongress said an insurer can\\'t invoke bankruptcy \\n\\nfor protections under the code. \\n\\nSo, Justice Kavanaugh, to your \\n\\nquestion about the text and practicalities, \\n\\nCongress answered the question of whether an \\n\\ninsurer should be permitted to butt into a \\n\\ndebtor\\'s bankruptcy and try to use it to protect \\n\\nits own financial interests.

And at confirmation, we are knowing\\n\\n then that the creditor is impaired or not\\n\\n impaired.\\n\\n So those are the two key timing\\n\\n mechanisms.  It can\\'t be at the outset of a \\n\\nbankruptcy because there isn\\'t enough known \\n\\nabout the nature of the estate --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if he\\'s \\n\\nnot impaired, doesn\\'t he have an interest in \\n\\nmaking sure that doesn\\'t change? \\n\\nMR.

That\\'s the Thorpe \\n\\ncase out of the Ninth Circuit, the Global case \\n\\nout of the Third Circuit. \\n\\nBut, in those situations where there\\'s \\n\\nan insurance neutrality provision and the \\n\\ninsurance company is not able to say with any \\n\\nproof that its legal obligations are materially \\n\\naltered, the courts of appeals have said: \\n\\nYou\\'re not a party in interest. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn\\'t \\n\\nTruck want to have something to say about the --\\n\\nthe division that you\\'ve just cited? \\n\\nMR.

HO\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\\n\\n MS. HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, \\n\\nand may it please the Court: \\n\\nIf anyone is a party in interest \\n\\nentitled to be heard in this Chapter 11 case, \\n\\nit\\'s the insurer, Truck, who will pay virtually \\n\\nevery dollar the debtors owe the asbestos \\n\\nclaimants. \\n\\nYet, the Fourth Circuit\\'s rule denies \\n\\nthat insurer a voice.  That rule, which my \\n\\nfriends barely defend, violates the text, \\n\\ncontext, and history of 1109(b). \\n\\nIt also defies the practical reality \\n\\nthat Chapter 11 cases are, as this Court has \\n\\nrecognized, collaborative, working best when all \\n\\nstakeholders come together at the outset to hash \\n\\nthings out. \\n\\nCongress recognized that reality and \\n\\n \\n\\n spoke expansively in 1109(b) to extend the right\\n\\n to be heard to any issue.  Congress also gave \\n\\ncourts a duty to ensure compliance with the code \\n\\nand invited broad participation to help\\n\\n discharge that duty.  1109(b)\\'s breadth is a \\n\\nfeature, not a bug.\\n\\n It\\'s now common ground that a party in \\n\\ninterest is one who could be directly and\\n\\n adversely affected by the case.  That\\'s Truck in \\n\\nat least two ways. \\n\\nFirst, it\\'s the insurer paying the \\n\\nvast bulk of claims against the debtors.  In the \\n\\ngovernment\\'s terms, it\\'s a contracting party. \\n\\nFrom the start then, Truck\\'s rights could have \\n\\nbeen directly and adversely affected by this \\n\\ncase. The proof of that pudding is in the plan \\n\\nfinding, which resolved key -- a key coverage \\n\\ndispute against Truck. \\n\\nSecond, Truck\\'s a creditor for \\n\\nmillions in insurance deductibles. \\n\\nFor both reasons, 1109(b)\\'s plain \\n\\nterms entitle Truck to be heard on any issue. \\n\\nIn silencing Truck, the Fourth Circuit \\n\\nviolated those terms by limiting who a party in \\n\\ninterest is and what issues they can raise. \\n\\n \\n\\nI welcome the Court\\'s questions.\\n\\n JUSTICE THOMAS:  Ms. Ho, at what point \\n\\ndo you determine the status of party in\\n\\n interest? \\n\\nMS. HO: Thank you, Justice Thomas.\\n\\n At the -- at the outset. Section 1109(b)\\'s text\\n\\n refers to \"be heard under any issue in [this] \\n\\ncase.\" So we think that has to be an ex ante \\n\\ninquiry, in part because there are other \\n\\nprovisions of the code apart from 1109(b) that \\n\\naffect parties in interest that don\\'t depend on \\n\\na specific plan or any plan. \\n\\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, the -- in this \\n\\ncase, the -- the determination at the end or --\\n\\nor in -- was that Truck was not negatively \\n\\naffected.  How could you determine that at the \\n\\n-- at the beginning of the proceedings? \\n\\nMS. HO: Yes, Your Honor, because I \\n\\nthink the question should be \"could,\" could --\\n\\ncould the entity be affected by the Chapter 11 \\n\\ncase. And as the insurer, there are any number \\n\\nof ways that Truck could have been affected.  It \\n\\ncould have been affected by a plan that -- that \\n\\nresulted in one, as we were seeking, with fraud \\n\\nprevention measures, or it could have resulted, \\n\\n \\n\\nas had happened, in a plan that didn\\'t include\\n\\n those.\\n\\n We -- we came into this Chapter 11\\n\\n proceeding as a creditor.  The proceeding could \\n\\nhave resulted in our claims being impaired or \\n\\nunimpaired. And you don\\'t know that until the\\n\\n end, but that doesn\\'t -- the -- the language of \\n\\n1109(b) speaks to a creditor. So, if you\\'re a \\n\\nparty in interest in the beginning with a right \\n\\nto be heard under 1109(b), then you\\'re a party \\n\\nin interest all the way through --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if --\\n\\nMS. HO: -- Justice Thomas. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT:  I -- I -- I \\n\\nknow there\\'s -- we could have some back and \\n\\nforth about the facts, but in a hypothetical, \\n\\nlet\\'s assume that your client, whichever plan --\\n\\nyou know, there\\'s three different plans on the \\n\\ntable, and under every one, your client gets --\\n\\nyou know, the -- his exposure is exactly the \\n\\nsame. It makes no difference to him which \\n\\nparticular creditors are going to get what. \\n\\nHe\\'s -- just given the factual situation, he\\'s \\n\\ngoing to walk away with exactly what he has or \\n\\nwhat he doesn\\'t have when it\\'s all done. \\n\\n \\n\\nIn what sense is -- does he have an \\n\\ninterest in how his assets are distributed or --\\n\\nor what the liabilities are?  In other words,\\n\\n although he is -- you could identify where he is\\n\\n going to, you know, be on the hook or not on the\\n\\n hook, but at the end of the day, everybody\\n\\n agrees it\\'s not going to make any difference.\\n\\n Now does he get -- still get to \\n\\nparticipate because his assets are going to be \\n\\nused in some form or another? \\n\\nMS. HO: Yes, Your Honor.  And this \\n\\ngoes -- Mr. Chief Justice, this goes to, I \\n\\nthink, the colloquy I was having with Justice \\n\\nThomas about the importance of the ex ante \\n\\ndetermination of who a party in interest is, \\n\\nright? It\\'s somebody who could be directly and \\n\\nadversely affected.  And I think one may --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, under my \\n\\nhypothetical, he -- he\\'s going -- I guess my \\n\\nhypothetical, he\\'s going to be adversely \\n\\naffected to exactly the same extent or not \\n\\naffected at all. \\n\\nMS. HO: I think, as -- as long as --\\n\\nas -- as -- as -- as in the course of the case \\n\\nthat -- that entity is directly and adversely \\n\\n \\n\\n affected, and I think one -- one way that we \\n\\nknow that, Mr. Chief Justice, is because, if you \\n\\nlook at 1109(b), one of the entities that\\'s\\n\\n expressly listed is a creditor.\\n\\n And we also know that different \\n\\nprovisions of the code, it matters whether you\\n\\n are impaired or unimpaired, right?  So, in other \\n\\nwords, you don\\'t get a vote on a plan if your\\n\\n interests are not impaired. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and we \\n\\nalso know --\\n\\nMS. HO: But that is different than \\n\\nbeing heard, Mr. Chief Justice. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. We also \\n\\nknow that in these proceedings, there are some \\n\\ncreditors that are just not going to get \\n\\nanything because of their particular status and \\n\\nall that. Now I suppose you want to say these \\n\\n-- technically, under the rule, he can go in, \\n\\nand maybe that\\'s a difference in this case.  But \\n\\nis -- is the -- a party in interest, is the same \\n\\ntest for that Article III? \\n\\nMS. HO: That\\'s our position.  Our --\\n\\nour position, which is the position adopted by \\n\\nthe Third Circuit, is that the test for that is \\n\\n \\n\\n Article III, which -- which --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, under\\n\\n Article III, if you\\'re not going to be injured \\n\\nat all because the proceedings -- you know \\n\\nyou\\'re not going to get any money or you know \\n\\nyou\\'re not going to have any left or whatever it\\n\\n is, I don\\'t know that that would satisfy Article \\n\\nIII just because people are going to be fighting\\n\\n about who gets your money.  But the one thing \\n\\nthat\\'s clear, it\\'s not going to be you. \\n\\nMS. HO: Well, I think, though, you \\n\\ndon\\'t know that.  You don\\'t know that at the \\n\\noutset of -- of -- of the -- of -- of the \\n\\nproceeding, right?  So a creditor does not know, \\n\\na party in interest or an equity holder does not \\n\\nknow, and even the debtor doesn\\'t know --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, \\n\\nthat, I think, is --\\n\\nMS. HO: -- until the very end. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is fighting \\n\\nmy hypothetical.  And, you know, maybe it\\'s not \\n\\na good hypothetical, but -- but assume that that \\n\\nis the fact, that -- that they\\'re not going to \\n\\nbe affected one way or another.  They\\'re just so \\n\\nfar down the line of, you know, people who can \\n\\n \\n\\n recover or so far down the line of people who \\n\\nare responsible that they\\'re really not going to\\n\\n get anything else.\\n\\n MS. HO: I -- I do hate to fight your\\n\\n hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, but I -- I -- I\\n\\n do think such a person -- I think it\\'s -- I \\n\\nguess maybe I\\'m fighting it because it\\'s hard to \\n\\nknow, it\\'s maybe impossible to know at the \\n\\noutset of any proceeding whose ox is going to be \\n\\ngored and -- and how much. That is very much an \\n\\nopen question. \\n\\nThat -- that is why Congress, in \\n\\n1109(b), spread -- spread a -- set a big table \\n\\nso that all parties in interest can come and \\n\\nparticipate and be heard and work -- work out \\n\\nthe negotiation among the parties who have a \\n\\nstake, who could be directly --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I guess I\\'m --\\n\\nMS. HO: -- affected by the \\n\\nproceedings --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I\\'m -- I\\'m not \\n\\nsure, Ms. Ho, how your \"at the outset\" rule fits \\n\\nwith your Article III rule --\\n\\nMS. HO: Mm-hmm. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  -- because, as -- as \\n\\n \\n\\nyou just suggested, at the outset, there\\'s going\\n\\n to be a lot of things you don\\'t know.  You don\\'t\\n\\n know what the plan is going to be.  You don\\'t \\n\\nknow whether the plan is going to affect you,\\n\\n injure you or not.  You don\\'t know -- you know, \\n\\nall the things that we think of in the standing\\n\\n context:  Is there imminent injury?  Is there \\n\\nsome traceability? At the outset, many people\\n\\n won\\'t have the answers to those questions. \\n\\nSo I guess I can understand an \"at --\\n\\nat the outset\" rule, and I can understand an \\n\\nArticle III rule, but I\\'m not sure I can \\n\\nunderstand both of them together. \\n\\nMS. HO: Sure. Two points to that, \\n\\nJustice Kagan. \\n\\nTo -- to start, you know, we -- we do \\n\\nthink that party in interest is coextensive with \\n\\nArticle III, but you -- you wouldn\\'t -- you \\n\\nwouldn\\'t have to agree with me on that to agree \\n\\nin terms of what -- who a party in interest is \\n\\nunder -- under the statute. \\n\\nBut, secondly, I -- I do think there \\n\\nis a good fit --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  So your first answer \\n\\nis you\\'re willing to give up the Article III? \\n\\n \\n\\nMS. HO: Well, I don\\'t think my -- I \\n\\njust wanted to make clear, Your Honor, I don\\'t\\n\\n think -- you don\\'t have to agree with me --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  That\\'s --\\n\\nthat\\'s a fine answer.\\n\\n MS. HO: -- on -- on -- on -- on \\n\\nArticle III.  We do think it\\'s -- it is -- it is\\n\\n coextensive, as the Third Circuit has held for a\\n\\n dozen years, and I don\\'t -- I don\\'t think \\n\\nthere\\'s any tension between that and ex-ante. \\n\\nI think the -- the way to think about \\n\\nit is it\\'s -- it\\'s -- it\\'s basically do you have \\n\\nstanding and does disaggregating that from the \\n\\nmerits, right, what a plan will actually do or \\n\\nhow the proceeding will actually unfold. \\n\\nIn the same way that this Court, you \\n\\nknow, doesn\\'t let the standing inquiry determine \\n\\nthe merits, I think this -- it operates the same \\n\\nway in 1109(b) in the party in interest \\n\\ndiscussion and analysis, is that you\\'re looking \\n\\nto see could -- could these proceedings directly \\n\\nand adversely affect it. \\n\\nI think, as to traceability and \\n\\nredressability, I think those -- those \\n\\nrequirements of Article III will virtually \\n\\n \\n\\nalways be satisfied in -- in every case where\\n\\n there\\'s a party in interest, right?\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we -- can I --\\n\\nMS. HO: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- break this\\n\\n down?\\n\\n There are various points at which you \\n\\ndecide standing. One is at the beginning of the\\n\\n suit. And I think what -- this is not an \\n\\nArticle III court.  This is an Article II court. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s not even a full court because it can\\'t \\n\\ndo everything an Article III court can do. \\n\\nIt\\'s closer, not quite, to an \\n\\nadministrative proceeding.  But it\\'s an Article \\n\\nII court.  And, generally, a -- a party in \\n\\ninterest is anyone that could be affected by a \\n\\nplan. The plan hasn\\'t come into effect, but you \\n\\ncould posit a thousand different ways that a \\n\\nplan could directly financially injure someone. \\n\\nThe Chief is positing a case where \\n\\nthere\\'s just not enough money, they\\'re never \\n\\ngoing to reach down here, but you don\\'t know \\n\\nthat because you don\\'t know what claims are \\n\\ngoing to be disallowed, whether some priority \\n\\nclaims are not going to be accepted.  There\\'s \\n\\n \\n\\njust too -- that\\'s what you\\'re saying about the\\n\\n unknown?\\n\\n MS. HO: Yes.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now the question \\n\\nbecomes when you get to the point that a plan --\\n\\nand this is the point we\\'re at -- when we get to \\n\\nthe point that a plan is in place, now the \\n\\nquestion is who can object to that plan,\\n\\n correct?  And now the question becomes what are \\n\\nthe reasons you can object? \\n\\nAnd you\\'re saying, because this plan \\n\\nas structured not only violates the terms of our \\n\\ncontract, it also violates the terms of the \\n\\nbankruptcy court -- court.  You\\'re saying that \\n\\nthere\\'s a separate good faith and fair dealing, \\n\\nan equal treatment requirement under the \\n\\nBankruptcy Code and that this plan violated \\n\\nthat, correct? \\n\\nMS. HO: Correct, Your Honor. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now the net -- the \\n\\nnet neutrality test doesn\\'t answer that second \\n\\nquestion, correct? \\n\\nMS. HO: Correct. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because whether or \\n\\nnot, if this plan in some way has treated you \\n\\n \\n\\ndifferently from the Debtors\\' other debts with\\n\\n no reasonable basis to do so, that could breach \\n\\nthe Bankruptcy Code, good faith and fair\\n\\n dealing, correct? \\n\\nMS. HO: Correct.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So now \\n\\nit\\'s possible after we go through all of this\\n\\n that the court below will say:  No, it doesn\\'t \\n\\nbreach it, but you have a right to be heard on \\n\\nthat. That\\'s what you\\'re saying.  That\\'s the \\n\\nstanding, correct? \\n\\nMS. HO: Yes, yes. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that\\'s the \\n\\ndifference between you can\\'t flip things and get \\n\\nto the merits in that way, you have to look at \\n\\nthat standing issue on the basis of the moment \\n\\nthe plan is there, I am being affected by the \\n\\nplan. \\n\\nIt\\'s possible that that affect won\\'t \\n\\nrise to the level of something that I will be \\n\\ngiven something to, but I have a right for them \\n\\nto hear me out on this, correct? \\n\\nMS. HO: Correct. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I ask you about \\n\\nthe difference between your view and the \\n\\n \\n\\n government\\'s view?  I understood the \\n\\ngovernment\\'s view to be narrower but that you\\n\\n would also be covered by it.\\n\\n So do you reject their sort of\\n\\n contract-based determination here?\\n\\n MS. HO: No, not at all, Justice\\n\\n Jackson.  And I -- I -- I don\\'t see the\\n\\n government\\'s position as -- as a different -- as\\n\\n a different test.  I --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Do you agree it\\'s \\n\\nnarrower than yours? \\n\\nMS. HO: I think I -- I think I would. \\n\\nI think I would agree that it\\'s -- that it\\'s \\n\\nnarrower. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  So why is yours \\n\\nbetter? \\n\\nMS. HO: I actually don\\'t know that --\\n\\nthat one is -- is -- is -- is better or the \\n\\nother. I think what the government is saying is \\n\\nwe -- we both agree that 1109(b), that the text \\n\\nis broad and expansive. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. \\n\\nMS. HO: We -- we -- we both agree \\n\\nthat we are -- we are a creditor --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. \\n\\n \\n\\nMS. HO: -- and that we were entitled\\n\\n to be heard that way.\\n\\n JUSTICE JACKSON:  But setting aside\\n\\n the --\\n\\nMS. HO: And I think -- I think the\\n\\n government\\'s position is they\\'re focusing on the \\n\\n-- anyone who holds an executory contract.\\n\\n And -- and we do. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. \\n\\nMS. HO: So that -- that -- that \\n\\nbrings us -- that brings us in. So I don\\'t -- I \\n\\ndon\\'t see that as --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess what I\\'m \\n\\nworried about a little bit --\\n\\nMS. HO: Yes. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  -- is that if we go \\n\\nbeyond people who hold a contract and just to \\n\\nanyone who\\'s adversely affected, I guess you \\n\\ncould imagine that a competitor in this \\n\\nenvironment would say, I\\'m adversely affected, \\n\\nyou know, by what is happening with the \\n\\nbankruptcy of this other business. \\n\\nWould -- would we be opening the door \\n\\nto allowing in the kinds of entities on the \\n\\nbasis of your broad test that you would \\n\\n \\n\\n otherwise think Congress would not have wanted\\n\\n to be a party in interest?\\n\\n MS. HO: No, Your Honor.  And --\\n\\nand -- and to be clear, we are -- we are more \\n\\nthan happy to embrace a holding of this Court \\n\\nthat we are a party in interest who can be heard \\n\\non any issue because of the insurance contract \\n\\nthat we hold. So I want to be clear on that.\\n\\n But I think, to your point about \\n\\nthe -- the floodgates argument that my friends \\n\\nraise, I don\\'t think so, because I think the \\n\\ndirect and adverse test which we believe is \\n\\ncoextensive with Article III, it -- it has \\n\\nteeth. Again, it has been the rule in the \\n\\nTwelfth Circuit for over a dozen years.  And I \\n\\n-- I -- my friends on the other side really \\n\\ncan\\'t point to any sort of chaos that has \\n\\nresulted from it. \\n\\nSo I -- I think our -- our test has \\n\\nteeth. And I -- and I also think that Congress, \\n\\nagain, as I started by saying, I think the \\n\\nbreadth is -- is a feature and not a bug here, \\n\\nthat Congress wanted to bring stakeholders to \\n\\nthe table, parties in interest who had a stake. \\n\\nAnd if anyone -- if anyone has a stake in this \\n\\n \\n\\nChapter 11 proceeding, it is the insurer who \\n\\nwill be paying the vast bulk of claims --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Isn\\'t that --\\n\\nMS. HO: -- against the Debtors.\\n\\n JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  This doesn\\'t hurt \\n\\nyour argument, but isn\\'t it true that the \\n\\ninsurer will, who\\'s responsible for the claims, \\n\\nwill always or almost always be a party in\\n\\n interest then in bankruptcies --\\n\\nMS. HO: I -- I -- I --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- mass tort \\n\\nbankruptcies? \\n\\nMS. HO: I -- I -- I think that\\'s -- I \\n\\nthink that\\'s right.  And when -- when I sort of \\n\\nthink through my -- to myself, you know, what --\\n\\nwho -- who else could be brought in under our \\n\\ntest, I -- I -- I do think the -- the single \\n\\nlargest group are the -- are -- are insurers and \\n\\nwho will also often come in as creditors as \\n\\nwell, as -- as we do -- as we do too. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, just on the \\n\\nArticle III point, I wonder whether we need to \\n\\ntangle or should tangle with it because I think \\n\\nof Article III as the -- the plaintiff coming to \\n\\ncourt has to establish an injury. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnd -- and who the plaintiff is in a \\n\\nbankruptcy case, I don\\'t know, maybe the \\n\\npetitioner, right, but normally we say someone\\n\\n objecting to relief under Bond, under Clapper,\\n\\n doesn\\'t have to establish Article III standing. \\n\\nAnd that would seem to be a closer fit to a\\n\\n party or a group like yours seeking to object to\\n\\n a plan.\\n\\n MS. HO: I certainly don\\'t disagree \\n\\nthat in -- in -- in the context where what you \\n\\nhave is someone who is only objecting, right, to \\n\\nthe relief being sought, and -- and that is us \\n\\nto a T, right?  We are -- we are objecting to \\n\\nthe plan. \\n\\nI think there may be a different issue \\n\\nraised when you get to, say, appellate standing, \\n\\nbut -- but in terms of 1109(b) party in \\n\\ninterest, we -- we do -- we do agree that as we \\n\\nare the -- we are opposing through -- yes, thank \\n\\nyou. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, \\n\\ncounsel. \\n\\nJustice Thomas? \\n\\nJustice Sotomayor? \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I\\'m assuming if we \\n\\n \\n\\nreach it on the government\\'s theory or in your\\n\\n theory, that directly and adversely means an \\n\\ninsured, because they have a contract --\\n\\nMS. HO: Yes.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is -- is a\\n\\n party in interest --\\n\\nMS. HO: Yes.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that should be \\n\\nheard, that we don\\'t have to reach the creditor \\n\\nissue or the Article III issue? \\n\\nMS. HO: That\\'s correct, Your Honor. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? \\n\\nJustice Gorsuch? \\n\\nJustice Kavanaugh? \\n\\nJustice Barrett? \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, let\\'s see. \\n\\nIt -- it seems to me that maybe we would have to \\n\\nat least say Article III doesn\\'t apply because \\n\\nyou\\'re not -- because someone like the insurer \\n\\nis not the one invoking it. \\n\\nI guess I\\'m -- I would be a little bit \\n\\nworried, as you say, if Congress is setting the \\n\\ntable broadly and parties in interest cut \\n\\nbroadly, it\\'s speculative, right? I mean, it --\\n\\n \\n\\nit\\'s pretty speculative.\\n\\n You might be able to articulate a way\\n\\n that the plan could adversely affect your \\n\\ninterests, but it would be speculative. And so \\n\\nmaybe we don\\'t have to say whether Article III \\n\\napplies in Article I courts, but if I think you \\n\\nmight have a problem satisfying Article III, I \\n\\nthink I would still have to say you have\\n\\n statutory standing, right? \\n\\nMS. HO: Yes. I -- I think there\\'s no \\n\\n-- there -- I don\\'t believe there\\'s any dispute \\n\\nthat we have Article III standing here and in \\n\\nthe court below because we weren\\'t heard, and so \\n\\nwe\\'re challenging that we -- we were not -- were \\n\\nnot heard. \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Yes. \\n\\nMS. HO: I do think, in terms of the \\n\\nArticle III issue, the Fourth Circuit did \\n\\naddress our creditor issue in Article III terms, \\n\\nbut I think what that court was really doing was \\n\\nit was reading any issue out of the statute. \\n\\nSo I think from the -- this Court\\'s \\n\\nperspective, I don\\'t think there\\'s any question \\n\\nabout our Article III status.  I think the \\n\\nquestion is, are we a party in interest?  We --\\n\\n \\n\\nwe say --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.\\n\\n MS. HO: -- that\\'s directly and\\n\\n adversely affected.  The government says it\\'s\\n\\n because we have an executory contract.  Either \\n\\nway, I think we -- we satisfy the statutory \\n\\nstanding and we also satisfy Article III\\n\\n standing here.\\n\\n           JUSTICE BARRETT: Oh, I see what \\n\\nyou\\'re -- I mean, I get what you\\'re saying. I\\'m \\n\\njust saying, if I don\\'t want your test, if I \\n\\ndon\\'t want to say that the statutory standard is \\n\\ncoextensive with Article III --\\n\\nMS. HO: Yes. \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  -- that\\'s -- that\\'s \\n\\nthe issue that I might have. \\n\\nAnd then just very briefly, could you \\n\\ndescribe for me for the uninsured claims what \\n\\nexactly -- I mean, you know, the -- you know, \\n\\nKaiser and the -- the Claimants are fighting \\n\\npretty hard to keep the insured claimants out. \\n\\nSo what exactly are the fraud \\n\\nprotection measures that would apply to the \\n\\nuninsured claims, the ones that you want to \\n\\napply to the insured claims as well? \\n\\n \\n\\nMS. HO: Sure. There are essentially\\n\\n two, Justice Barrett.  The first would require\\n\\n all claimants to disclose all known exposures --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.\\n\\n MS. HO: -- right, to all defendants.\\n\\n And the second primary requirement or \\n\\nmeasure would be a release that would allow the\\n\\n trust to obtain information from the other\\n\\n trusts on that. \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Thank you. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice \\n\\nJackson? \\n\\nThank you, counsel. \\n\\nMS. HO: Thank you. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Yang.\\n\\n  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG \\n\\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER \\n\\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief \\n\\nJustice, and may it please the Court: \\n\\nBoth counterparties to executory \\n\\ncontracts and creditors are parties in interest \\n\\nthat may be -- appear and be heard on any issue \\n\\nin a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. If a party is \\n\\na party in interest, they get a seat at the \\n\\n \\n\\n reorganization table, and once they\\'re at the \\n\\ntable, they can be heard on any issue in the\\n\\n case. And that status must be determined ex\\n\\n ante, that is, before the court considers the \\n\\nquestions, because the right is to be heard in\\n\\n advance.\\n\\n That doesn\\'t depend on the merits of \\n\\nthe position, and it cannot be determined based \\n\\non what a plan proposes because a party in \\n\\ninterest under 1121(c) can itself propose a \\n\\nplan. Moreover, the plan is never final until \\n\\nall appellate proceedings have -- on the \\n\\nconfirmation are ended.  And so they can \\n\\nparticipate all the way through. \\n\\nThe code contemplates that every \\n\\nexecutory contract must either be assumed or \\n\\nrejected.  Either way -- and I\\'d like to develop \\n\\nthat in our conversation -- but either way, a \\n\\nparty -- a counterparty is a party in interest. \\n\\nI\\'d be happy to -- to follow up on \\n\\nthat. \\n\\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Yang, what\\'s the \\n\\ndifference between your view and -- or your \\n\\napproach to 1109 and Petitioner\\'s? \\n\\nMR. YANG: Well, I think Petitioner\\'s \\n\\n \\n\\n view, while -- it appears to me that they are\\n\\n interpreting \"party in interest\" based on some\\n\\n older Interstate Commerce Act cases that\\n\\n borrowed some Article III concepts when \\n\\ninterpreting \"party in interest.\"\\n\\n We just don\\'t think that\\'s a term of \\n\\nart. It\\'s not clear to me that they actually \\n\\nsay that you have to have Article III standing \\n\\nto raise an objection. I think it\\'s more based \\n\\non the term, and the -- the Article III ideas \\n\\nwere incorporated by reference to the cases. \\n\\nSo I\\'m not sure we disagree about \\n\\nArticle III.  We just disagree about the \\n\\ninterpretive method.  Our interpretive method \\n\\njust goes to the text. The text is broad.  It\\'s \\n\\nnot so broad as to get amici or, you know, \\n\\npeople with very tangential views in the case. \\n\\nBut, in this case, it certainly \\n\\napplies expressly to creditors, and we say -- we \\n\\nthink it applies to parties with executory \\n\\ncontracts because, remember, executory contracts \\n\\nunder 365 are either going to be assumed \\n\\naffirmatively or rejected, and if assumed, \\n\\nsometimes they\\'re assigned to somebody else. \\n\\nNow, if the debtor seeks to assume a \\n\\n \\n\\ncontract, they have to satisfy Section 365\\'s\\n\\n standards that protect the counterparty.  If\\n\\n there has been some kind of breach, it has to be\\n\\n cured. Certain contracts cannot be assumed. \\n\\nAnd the counterparty can object. Among other \\n\\nthings, the counterparty has an interest in the \\n\\ndebtor\\'s ability to fulfill that contract going \\n\\nforward. And the debtor has to move to assume a\\n\\n contract.  It has to show that the business \\n\\njudgment standard has been met.  A counterparty \\n\\ncan object. \\n\\nNow, if the debtor wants to reject the \\n\\ncontract -- Justice Kagan, your -- your opinion \\n\\nin Mission Products Holdings addresses this --\\n\\nthat results in a breach of contract.  It \\n\\nresults in a claim, and then the creditor is a \\n\\nclaimant and not in a real good position because \\n\\nit\\'s usually a pre-petition plain -- claim, and \\n\\nyou get pennies on the dollar in most contexts. \\n\\nEither way, assumed or rejected, they \\n\\nhave an interest.  Now that\\'s reflected not only \\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Yang, in an -- in \\n\\nan old case of ours, we used the term \"adversely \\n\\nand directly affected.\"  Do you accept that \\n\\n \\n\\nstandard, or do you think we should not have a\\n\\n standard like that?\\n\\n MR. YANG: You know, I\\'m not really \\n\\nsure where that standard comes from except\\n\\n unless you -- are drawing from Article III.  We\\n\\n don\\'t really object, I think, to the outcome of\\n\\n having some direct effect.  Whether you\\'re \\n\\nadversely affected, though, you don\\'t -- I think \\n\\nis the wrong question. \\n\\nYou have to have the potential to be \\n\\nadversely affected in a bankruptcy because \\n\\nthat\\'s what the reorganization is.  You bring \\n\\neverybody in who has a potential to be affected \\n\\nand you work it out. \\n\\nSo going back to the pre-code \\n\\nBankruptcy Act, and --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and -- and --\\n\\nsorry. \\n\\nMR. YANG: Sure. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  If I could just follow \\n\\nup. You -- you too -- and this is just like Ms. \\n\\nHo -- said at the outset this is --\\n\\nMR. YANG: Yeah. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  What if you don\\'t \\n\\nreally know whether your -- you have any \\n\\n \\n\\ninterest in this until the middle of the thing?\\n\\n I mean, I can imagine many -- many events taking \\n\\nplace, including there\\'s now a plan on the table \\n\\nand now you look at the plan on the table and\\n\\n you think:  Oh, my gosh, I could be affected.\\n\\n It just seems a strange thing in a \\n\\nbankruptcy proceeding, which is fluid and has \\n\\nmany twists and turns, that you would say do \\n\\nthis at the outset and -- and apparently only at \\n\\nthe outset. \\n\\nMR. YANG: Let me answer that, and I \\n\\nthink it\\'s easiest to answer it in the context \\n\\nof executory contracts and creditors, right? \\n\\nExecutory contracts, they\\'re always going to \\n\\nhave potentially some effect.  Maybe you just, \\n\\nyou know, don\\'t know what the effect is going to \\n\\nbe, and a lot of people who could be parties in \\n\\ninterest, just because it doesn\\'t fit into the \\n\\n-- it doesn\\'t make rational economic sense, they \\n\\ndon\\'t participate, right?  They just don\\'t \\n\\nparticipate until -- they have a right to, but \\n\\nthey don\\'t until it becomes relevant. \\n\\nThe pre-Bankruptcy Act -- Code Act \\n\\nlabels executory contractors as parties in \\n\\ninterest.  Why? It\\'s because they had to get \\n\\n \\n\\nadvance notice of rejection. And there\\'s a case \\n\\ncalled King versus Baer of the Tenth Circuit,\\n\\n 1973, it explains that -- you give them notice \\n\\nin a hearing so they can be heard.\\n\\n Currently, the current code says that\\n\\n the -- the counterparty can seek an order to set\\n\\n a period to assume or reject.  That\\'s 365(d)(2).\\n\\n Other parties in interest may similarly set --\\n\\nset that same period, but they can only do so in \\n\\nthe context of status conferences.  That\\'s \\n\\n105(d)(2)(A).  All of this is showing that \\n\\nparties in interest -- that -- that executory \\n\\ncounter -- contract counterparties are parties \\n\\nin interest. \\n\\nNow there\\'s a few things that I\\'d like \\n\\nto address.  One is there\\'s a question about \\n\\nhaving a voice and not a vote. I think that \\n\\ngoes to the question of being impaired. \\n\\nImpaired is what the plan under Section 1124 \\n\\nproposes.  But there are other requirements for \\n\\na plan.  For instance, a plan needs to be \\n\\nfeasible. So, if you\\'re a creditor and the plan \\n\\nproposes satisfying everything, but it satisfies \\n\\nit in a way that\\'s not likely to end up being \\n\\nimplemented -- you can object under 1129(a), I \\n\\n \\n\\nthink it\\'s (a)(11), that the plan\\'s not\\n\\n feasible.\\n\\n So the impairment just talks about the\\n\\n separate requirement that the classes vote.  It\\n\\n doesn\\'t set -- address your right to be heard,\\n\\n which, by the way, is not only a right to be \\n\\nheard to object, but it\\'s a right to be heard to\\n\\n support the plan, right?  If you\\'re not\\n\\n impaired, you may well want to come in and \\n\\nsupport the plan. \\n\\nThe floodgates question, it largely \\n\\nturns, I think, on the question of any issue, \\n\\nnot the problem of party in interest.  Like \\n\\ntake, for instance, the vending contractor that \\n\\n-- that everyone\\'s talking about. The problem \\n\\nis not that a vending contractor gets to come in \\n\\nand be a party in interest and participate with \\n\\nrespect to the vending contract, whether it\\'s \\n\\nassumed or rejected or interpreted in a way it \\n\\ndoesn\\'t like.  The concern is that it\\'s also \\n\\nheard on any issue. \\n\\nBut the text of 1109(b) and its \\n\\nhistory, the evolution of expanding those groups \\n\\nthat can speak on any issue, foreclose any real \\n\\ntextual ability to say, oh, you can only \\n\\n \\n\\n participate on certain issues.  \"Any issue\"\\n\\n means what it says.\\n\\n Secondly, the concerns about\\n\\n floodgates, I think, are totally overstated.\\n\\n Litigants make rational economic choices where\\n\\n they have a stake in reasonable arguments.  The\\n\\n right to be heard doesn\\'t impose on the courtan \\n\\n-- any burden to -- to speak at length if it\\n\\n doesn\\'t think there\\'s much to say about the \\n\\nissue. \\n\\nAnd the court has to decide the \\n\\nquestion anyway in terms of confirmation because \\n\\nthis Court, in United Student Aid Funds, \\n\\ndetermined that the court has to decide whether \\n\\nthe plan complies with the code even if no one \\n\\nobjects.\\n\\n And, finally, sanctions deters any \\n\\nkind of bad-faith conduct. Ultimately, this is \\n\\na balancing question, does it make sense to \\n\\nbring everybody in, we\\'re going to weigh it \\n\\nagainst maybe some burden of having their voices \\n\\nheard, we\\'re going to balance it against the \\n\\nwaste of resources of trying to decide who gets \\n\\nto be heard, and Congress struck that choice in \\n\\n1109(b). \\n\\n \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Does -- does your \\n\\nposition just boil down to the common-sense \\n\\npoint that an insurer is on the hook for the \\n\\nclaims in a mass tort bankruptcy as a party in\\n\\n interest?\\n\\n MR. YANG: I think that\\'s a subset of \\n\\nour point, and our -- our -- our -- our primary\\n\\n point is --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, all -- all \\n\\nwe need is that subset.  Don\\'t we?  I mean, \\n\\nisn\\'t that just kind of common -- I just thought \\n\\nthat is the common-sense point. \\n\\nMR. YANG: I -- I agree.  But I \\n\\nactually don\\'t think it\\'s that much different \\n\\nthan saying that a counterparty to an executory \\n\\ncontract is always going to have an interest. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Yang? \\n\\nMR. YANG: I -- I just don\\'t think \\n\\nthat that\\'s different.  And -- and the idea was \\n\\nthat Congress --- the legislative history \\n\\nreflects that the idea here is to hear all sides \\n\\nof an issue and then let the court decide. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Yang --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And the insurer is \\n\\nkind of obvious, right?  That\\'s your point. \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. YANG: Insurer\\'s an obvious one.\\n\\n JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah.\\n\\n MR. YANG: I mean, it -- it -- but it \\n\\nwould have included even the vending contractor.\\n\\n Now the vending contractor might not have\\n\\n participated?  Why?  Because, you know what, it\\n\\n didn\\'t matter.  It\\'s like small steaks, \\n\\npotatoes. The vending contractor is just not\\n\\n going to participate. \\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of people in the \\n\\nperiphery that just don\\'t participate.  The 10 \\n\\ncent creditor, unimpaired, unsecured 10 cent \\n\\ncreditor is expressly a party in interest, \\n\\nright? \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  What about an \\n\\nemployee?  You know, if we\\'re going with your \\n\\ndefinition, which has to do with contracts --\\n\\nMR. YANG: Yep. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I suppose an \\n\\nemployee has a contract, so are you saying that \\n\\nthey would be a party in interest? \\n\\nMR. YANG: An -- an employee can be a \\n\\nparty in interest as a party to an executory \\n\\ncontract.  Now there are certain code provisions \\n\\nthat deal with employees and unions and things \\n\\n \\n\\nlike that, but as a general matter, yes.\\n\\n JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.\\n\\n MR. YANG: That\\'s true. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON: And just in response \\n\\nto Justice Kagan, I -- I guess I didn\\'t \\n\\nunderstand you to be making a statement that the \\n\\nparties couldn\\'t be recognized on a rolling \\n\\nbasis, right? Like, if someone determines or \\n\\ndecides in the middle of it that they have an \\n\\ninterest, they can ask to come in? \\n\\nMR. YANG: Yes. But --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Is that right? \\n\\nMR. YANG: Yes, I think that\\'s true. \\n\\nThe -- the -- the reality is is they\\'ve always \\n\\nhad the interest to be potentially affected. \\n\\nThey might not have realized it --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. \\n\\nMR. YANG: -- until later --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank -- thank \\n\\nMR. YANG: -- but, when they realize \\n\\nit, they come in and, you know, they are given a \\n\\nright to be heard. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, \\n\\ncounsel. \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. YANG: Thank you.\\n\\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\\n\\n Thomas?\\n\\n Justice Sotomayor?\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your -- in your \\n\\nbrief, you say this case presents no occasion \\n\\nfor the Court to determine the phrase -- the \\n\\nphrase\\'s outermost -- party in interest\\'s\\n\\n outermost boundaries.  And you repeat that \\n\\ntoday, that we should just say clearly insurers \\n\\nor people with executory contracts, et cetera. \\n\\nBut don\\'t we have to say a little bit \\n\\nmore? Don\\'t -- don\\'t we have to say something \\n\\nlike \"directly and adversely affected\" to -- to \\n\\nquantify --\\n\\nMR. YANG: I\\'m not sure --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to take away \\n\\nthe employee who doesn\\'t -- who doesn\\'t have a \\n\\ncontract with the Debtor, but the employee who \\n\\nhas a contract with the Petitioner, Truck? \\n\\nCould he sue and say my salaries and \\n\\nbenefits are going to go down because this \\n\\ndoesn\\'t have an anti-fraud provision and the \\n\\ncompany\\'s going to lose more money? \\n\\nMR. YANG: Well, I don\\'t --\\n\\n \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I\\'m going to\\n\\n make less?\\n\\n MR. YANG: The Court might well want\\n\\n to say more.  The Court -- but the Court \\n\\ncertainly doesn\\'t have to to resolve the issue\\n\\n with respect to whether Truck is a party in\\n\\n interest.\\n\\n Now, if the Court were wanting to \\n\\nexplore the text of party in interest more, I \\n\\nthink what I would suggest is that the Court can \\n\\nexplain that a party is a participant on one or \\n\\n-- one of the sides of an action or an affair. \\n\\nIt\\'s not a person in interest.  It\\'s a \\n\\nparty in interest.  And context matters here. \\n\\nBankruptcies are aggregations of individual \\n\\ncontroversies, and the participants there have \\n\\nan interest in the proceedings\\' exercise of \\n\\njurisdiction over the debtor\\'s property and the \\n\\ndistribution. \\n\\nIf the proceeding has a potential to \\n\\naffect their interests, and it\\'s not necessarily \\n\\nan interest in the entitlement to specific \\n\\ndebtor properties, if the proceeding has the \\n\\npotential to affect their interests, that is \\n\\nenough to be a party in interest. \\n\\n \\n\\n39\\n\\n Now things that I think you\\'re talking \\n\\nabout kind of two orders of steps out have never\\n\\n been thought to be people who can come in with\\n\\n an interest.  And -- and you --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but how do\\n\\n I --\\n\\nMR. YANG: Right.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I love asking this\\n\\n question.  How do I write this so that there is \\n\\na difference between that employee and the truck \\n\\ncompany?  I can write it to say the truck \\n\\ncompany because it\\'s affected, but what -- but I \\n\\nhave to say something more to take care of those \\n\\ntwo and three down. \\n\\nMR. YANG: The employee of Truck? \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah. \\n\\nMR. YANG: Well, certainly, the Court \\n\\nwould have to decide how far it wants to go.  I \\n\\ndon\\'t think you have to decide employees of \\n\\nTruck since the question before the Court is not \\n\\nemployees of Truck. \\n\\nBut, if you wanted to, we don\\'t object \\n\\nto the idea that the participants in the -- that \\n\\nhave an interest in the proceeding have always \\n\\nbeen those that have a direct kind of not \\n\\n \\n\\n attenuated effect.  It\\'s not amici.  It\\'s not \\n\\nsome law professor. It\\'s not employees of \\n\\nsomebody else. It\\'s someone with a more direct\\n\\n effect.\\n\\n I don\\'t think that derives from \\n\\nArticle III, but I think you can derive it from \\n\\nkind of looking more generally at -- at\\n\\n bankruptcy practice.\\n\\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? \\n\\nJustice Gorsuch? \\n\\nJustice Kavanaugh? \\n\\nJustice Barrett? \\n\\nJustice Jackson? \\n\\nOkay. Thank you, counsel. \\n\\nMR. YANG: Thank you, Your Honor. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Marshall.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. KEVIN MARSHALL\\n\\n FOR THE DEBTOR RESPONDENTS \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and \\n\\nmay it please the Court: \\n\\nA party in interest is someone who has \\n\\na legal interest in a debtor\\'s bankruptcy \\n\\nestate, its property, not someone who is merely \\n\\nconcerned about the debtor\\'s bankruptcy more \\n\\ngenerally. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe list of parties in interest in\\n\\n Section 1109(b) shows this.  Settled usage of \\n\\nthe term in bankruptcy confirms it. And the \\n\\ngovernment, at least in its brief, agrees with\\n\\n it.\\n\\n At the outset of the case, the parties \\n\\nin interest will ordinarily be the debtor with \\n\\nits creditors and shareholders, those whom\\n\\n Section 1109(b) lists. \\n\\nOthers, as Justice Thomas was asking \\n\\nabout, may come to have an interest in the \\n\\nestate and, thus, can show that the bankruptcy \\n\\nwill directly affect their rights or \\n\\nobligations.  For example, if a plan would \\n\\nbreach an insurer\\'s policy, altering its \\n\\ncontract rights or obligations, then it would \\n\\nbecome a party in interest. \\n\\nBut, if a plan preserves the insurer\\'s \\n\\nstatus quo, it is insurance neutral, in that \\n\\ncase, the insurer is not a party in interest and \\n\\nit has no right to object to plan confirmation. \\n\\nHere, the plan does not alter Truck\\'s \\n\\ncontract rights or obligations.  It breaches \\n\\nnothing.  It does not do anything to put Truck \\n\\non the hook.  That is what the lower courts \\n\\n \\n\\nuniformly found, and Truck here does not\\n\\n challenge that finding.  Truck, therefore, has \\n\\nno right to challenge plan confirmation.\\n\\n Truck invokes policy concerns that \\n\\nwould supplant this settled clear rule with a\\n\\n novel expansive framework that would give \\n\\ninsurers greater rights to challenge plan \\n\\nconfirmation than even a creditor has. But\\n\\n bankruptcy law already addresses these concerns \\n\\nby allowing interested entities that are not \\n\\nparties in interest to pursue permissive \\n\\nintervention.  Truck simply ignores that tool. \\n\\nI welcome the Court\\'s questions. \\n\\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Marshall, the --\\n\\nat the beginning, at the outset of these \\n\\nproceedings, bankruptcy proceedings, Truck was a \\n\\ncreditor and Truck certainly from its vantage \\n\\npoint was a party in interest because of the --\\n\\nbeing the one insurer for all of the claims --\\n\\nmany of the claims here. \\n\\nSo do you think we should look at the \\n\\nfiling period as the point to -- to determine \\n\\nparty of interest, or should we do it at a later \\n\\npoint? \\n\\nIt would seem that you can\\'t do \\n\\n \\n\\n insurance neutrality at the beginning.  I don\\'t \\n\\nknow how you would do that.\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  If one is in the list \\n\\nof entities in Section 1109(b), it\\'s possible to \\n\\nanswer that question at the outset.\\n\\n JUSTICE THOMAS:  So they would be a\\n\\n creditor?\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  They were -- they were \\n\\na creditor, yes, but as to their status as an \\n\\ninsurer, the question is, do they have an \\n\\ninterest in the debtor\\'s bankruptcy estate?  And \\n\\nat the outset of the case, it was obviously a \\n\\nno, but then, when a plan is submitted and they \\n\\nwant to claim that that would breach their \\n\\npolicy rights and give them interest in the \\n\\nestate, then that would be the point at which --\\n\\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let me --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- the threshold \\n\\nquestion would need to be decided. \\n\\nJUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let me -- let\\'s \\n\\ngo back a second. \\n\\nAs a creditor, at the beginning, if \\n\\nthey are considered a party in interest, can \\n\\nthey raise any issue in the proceedings? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Under 1109(b), they \\n\\n \\n\\ngenerally can. In the context of a plan \\n\\nconfirmation, if they\\'re unimpaired, they don\\'t \\n\\nhave the right to object.\\n\\n JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Isn\\'t it just\\n\\n common sense that an insurer at the outset is\\n\\n going to have an interest in this because how\\n\\n much the insurer will have to pay will be \\n\\naffected by how the plan is structured? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Justice Kavanaugh, they \\n\\ncould be interested in the general sense of \\n\\nbeing concerned, which was the phrase Truck \\n\\ntended to use. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No, not just \\n\\nconcerned but how much they owe -- how much \\n\\nthey\\'re going to have to pay.  It\\'s not just I\\'m \\n\\nconcerned about things.  How much I\\'m going to \\n\\nhave to pay. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  And so then the \\n\\nquestion is, at what point do they come to have \\n\\nan interest in the estate? And if a plan is \\n\\nproposed that would -- that in their view would \\n\\nbreach their policy, they certainly have the \\n\\nright to be heard on whether it would, in fact, \\n\\nbreach their policy rights, and they were heard \\n\\nhere. \\n\\n \\n\\nAnd the courts, all the courts, all \\n\\nthree lower courts held their policy rights were\\n\\n not breached.  And so there\\'s nothing about the\\n\\n bankruptcy case that puts the insurer on the\\n\\n hook. That can happen in cases. It happened in \\n\\na Ninth Circuit case that\\'s in the briefs.\\n\\n And if -- if the plan actually --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But -- you\\'re \\n\\nsaying put them on the hook, but for how much \\n\\nthey\\'re going to be on the hook, that will be \\n\\naffected, right? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  I\\'m not sure I followed \\n\\nthat. The -- the -- nothing about the \\n\\nbankruptcy case changes Truck\\'s position.  If \\n\\nthe bankruptcy case were to -- to change an \\n\\ninsurer\\'s position, it would be a party in \\n\\ninterest and have a right to object to the plan. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But isn\\'t --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But they want the \\n\\nfraud prevention provisions.  What\\'s your \\n\\nresponse to that as -- as, you know, their \\n\\ninterest in having those established? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  There\\'s a threshold \\n\\nquestion whether they are a party in interest or \\n\\nnot, and that depends on whether they have an \\n\\n \\n\\n interest in the bankruptcy estate.  If they are \\n\\na party in interest, then they would have the \\n\\nright to come in and raise the issues of \\n\\nconcern, including the fraud prevention\\n\\n measures.\\n\\n But it\\'s a threshold question.\\n\\n Perhaps it\\'s helpful to think of an analogy.  A\\n\\n creditor, as we were discussing with Justice\\n\\n Thomas, has a right to raise any issue under \\n\\n1109(b), but there\\'s a threshold question \\n\\nwhether you actually are a creditor. So you can \\n\\ncome in and you can say you\\'re a creditor.  You \\n\\ndon\\'t actually have to move to intervene.  And a \\n\\ncourt -- if somebody challenges that, then the \\n\\ncourt has to decide, are you a creditor or not? \\n\\nThat\\'s --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Why are you --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  -- fighting this so \\n\\nhard? Why -- why do you want Truck to not even \\n\\nbe heard?  Just what is your motivation to be \\n\\nfighting this so hard? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  We have a deal with the \\n\\ncreditors.  We think it\\'s a valid deal and a \\n\\ngood deal, and we want to be done with \\n\\n \\n\\n bankruptcy.  And we don\\'t -- Truck has -- Truck \\n\\nis coming in to try to blow up the deal that we\\n\\n have.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I stop you a \\n\\nmoment? I am looking at the brief of amici \\n\\nAmerican Prosperity Casualty Insurance, and on \\n\\npage 15, they explain that once the plan is\\n\\n approved, this plan, under your terms, it\\n\\n obtains a discharge, the Debtor, and the \\n\\nprotection of a channeling injunction, now all \\n\\nthe claims are going to go through the trust and \\n\\nnot to you. \\n\\nThe Debtor has no ongoing incentive \\n\\nafter the plan is approved to limit the cost of \\n\\ndefending, paying claims, and any liability on \\n\\nthose claims.  You lose it.  That\\'s the benefit \\n\\nbankruptcy gives -- giving you.  And the \\n\\nClaimants, their incentive for this plan is that \\n\\nthey don\\'t want the anti-fraud provisions. \\n\\nSo who\\'s protecting the insured?  If \\n\\n-- if it -- the -- the insured can\\'t protect \\n\\nitself because you say it can\\'t go to the \\n\\nbankruptcy court, how is it being heard? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Nothing --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because what \\n\\n \\n\\nyou\\'re suggesting to us is that they don\\'t have \\n\\na right to say the plan is violating a bunch of\\n\\n other provisions of the code, 1129(a), or \\n\\npermitting the differential treatment of -- of \\n\\n-- of people who are owed money or of Claimants.\\n\\n I mean, I -- I -- I just don\\'t understand your\\n\\n argument.\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  They have --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I can argue that \\n\\nthe plan is breached, and once they say the \\n\\nplan\\'s not reached -- breached, I can\\'t argue \\n\\nthat the plan violates the code? I -- I\\'ve just \\n\\nnever heard of --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  If --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- parsing \\n\\nstanding in that way. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Justice Sotomayor, if \\n\\none is not a party in interest, there\\'s no right \\n\\nto raise issues.  Party-in-interest status is a \\n\\nthreshold question. \\n\\nAnd, here, as to Truck as an insurer, \\n\\nthey need to show they have an interest in the \\n\\nbankruptcy estate to get in, to answer the \\n\\nthreshold question. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they do. \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  And -- and to --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess the\\n\\n question --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- to do that --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Mr. Marshall, is I \\n\\nthink what everybody is saying to you is, well, \\n\\nthey do have an interest in these anti-fraud\\n\\n provisions.  Not just a concern, they have an\\n\\n interest, a material interest.  If they get the \\n\\nanti-fraud provisions, they\\'re better off. If \\n\\nthey don\\'t get the anti-fraud provisions, \\n\\nthey\\'re worse off. \\n\\nNow what I hear you saying back is \\n\\nthey had no preexisting entitlement to the \\n\\nanti-fraud provisions, and your test is one that \\n\\nsays, if they\\'re not being made worse off by the \\n\\nplan, then they\\'re not an interested party. \\n\\nBut I -- I don\\'t know why that should \\n\\nbe the test. If I look at the language, that\\'s \\n\\nnot the test.  If I think about what the \\n\\nordinary meaning of being a party who\\'s \\n\\ninterested is, that\\'s not the test. \\n\\nWhy -- why is your test so long as \\n\\nthey\\'re not being made worse off, they\\'re not an \\n\\ninterested party? \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Well, the -- the test\\n\\n of whether I -- there is a benefit I would like \\n\\nto get out of the bankruptcy case, which is\\n\\n Truck\\'s test, is unlimited.  Anytime you can\\n\\n imagine a hypothetical plan that would be better\\n\\n off for you --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, okay.  Well, \\n\\nthat\\'s a practical concern.\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  Well, it -- it --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  And I think, you know, \\n\\nthe practical argument against it is it\\'s pretty \\n\\ncostly to enter into these proceedings, and \\n\\nnobody really does it unless they have a serious \\n\\ninterest, and, anyway, bankruptcy courts have \\n\\ndocket management techniques. \\n\\nAnd, anyway, just putting aside the \\n\\npractical concerns, is this a floodgates problem \\n\\nor is it not a floodgates problem, I don\\'t \\n\\nreally see why your test, which is are you being \\n\\nmade worse off or are you being made -- or -- or \\n\\nis it -- you know, are you just being held to \\n\\nthe bargain that you initially had, I don\\'t see \\n\\nwhy anybody would think that that\\'s the way to \\n\\nanswer a question of whether you\\'re interested \\n\\nin a proceeding. \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  \"Party in interest\" is \\n\\na term of art that means you have an interest in \\n\\nthe debtor\\'s bankruptcy estate. That\\'s been the\\n\\n meaning for a hundred years.  And so that\\'s the\\n\\n way to start.\\n\\n But, if we\\'re going to think in terms \\n\\nof seeking to obtain a benefit, in the context \\n\\nof causes of action, Lexmark zone of interests, \\n\\nthe question is always, have you suffered a \\n\\nloss? If you\\'ve suffered a loss, you come in \\n\\nand you try to get a remedy. \\n\\nWhat Truck is saying here is, I can \\n\\ncome in, even though I\\'m suffering no loss at \\n\\nall to my legal rights, and just seek to obtain \\n\\na benefit because it\\'s very nice that this \\n\\nbankruptcy is here and maybe I can get something \\n\\nout of it. \\n\\nBut even if they don\\'t have the right \\n\\nto come in, there\\'s always permissive \\n\\nintervention.  So there\\'s the right to -- to \\n\\ncome in as an interested entity that\\'s not a \\n\\nparty in interest.  The benefit of that is it\\'s \\n\\nin the discretion of the bankruptcy court.  You \\n\\nhave to show cause.  The bankruptcy court can \\n\\ndecide whether you come in for all issues or \\n\\n \\n\\njust some.\\n\\n The question is, who has the right to\\n\\n intervene in the case? And it --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  So --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Would you object\\n\\n to permissive intervention in a situation like \\n\\nthis where the insurer is seeking fraud\\n\\n prevention?\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  We would have objected \\n\\nto their attempt to come in and object to the \\n\\nmerits of the plan, but they certainly have the \\n\\nright --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  That wasn\\'t the \\n\\nquestion. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Yeah. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The question \\n\\nwas object --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  They -- they could have \\n\\nsought to pursue inter- -- permissive \\n\\nintervention under 2018 to get to the merits of \\n\\nthe plan. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  And would you have \\n\\nobjected to that? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  We probably would have \\n\\nopposed that. \\n\\n \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Why?\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  For all the reasons \\n\\nthat we\\'re otherwise opposing.\\n\\n JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You just don\\'t\\n\\n want them to be heard.\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  We want -- they have\\n\\n the right to be heard, to make a showing they\\n\\n are --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  You don\\'t want the \\n\\nfraud prevention provisions, but you don\\'t want \\n\\nthem to be heard on that.  Is that -- I mean, \\n\\nthat\\'s okay. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Well, the -- all the \\n\\nlower courts --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I just want --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  I mean -- I mean, they \\n\\nwere heard on that.  All the lower courts ruled \\n\\nagainst them on the merits as well, both the \\n\\nbankruptcy and the district court, although the \\n\\nFourth Circuit --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Yeah. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- didn\\'t get to it. \\n\\nIt\\'s good to keep in mind if we\\'re \\n\\ngoing to be talking about the policy concerns \\n\\nthat bankruptcy is just not about get everybody \\n\\n \\n\\nto the table. It\\'s also about having an\\n\\n efficient and expeditious proceeding that makes \\n\\nit possible to resolve what is ultimately a\\n\\n question about the debtor and its creditors or, \\n\\nin some cases, its shareholders.\\n\\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it may not \\n\\nbe about getting everybody at the table, but you \\n\\ndo want all the creditors there, don\\'t you? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Yes, you do want all \\n\\nthe creditors there. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they\\'re \\n\\na creditor. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  As to the plan that\\'s \\n\\nat issue here, they were an unimpaired creditor, \\n\\nand an unimpaired creditor does not have the \\n\\nright to object to a plan.  That\\'s Section \\n\\n1126(f). \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Marshall --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  But at the time --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Mr. Marshall, the --\\n\\nthe language -- you agree that they had an \\n\\ninterest in the plan finding, right, about the \\n\\ngood faith and about whether this was going to \\n\\n \\n\\nbe collusive?  Everybody said below that they \\n\\nhad an interest in the plan finding.\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  The plan finding was a\\n\\n threshold question that they certainly had the\\n\\n right to litigate.\\n\\n JUSTICE BARRETT:  Right.  And they did \\n\\nhave an interest as a creditor because of the\\n\\n deductibles that were due, right?\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  They were a creditor. \\n\\nAs to the plan at issue here, they were \\n\\nunimpaired --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  But --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- and didn\\'t have the \\n\\nright to object. \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  -- that\\'s looking \\n\\nahead to the plan.  I guess what I want to say \\n\\nis that 1109(b) says that \"a party in interest,\" \\n\\nincluding our list, \"may be heard on any issue\" \\n\\nin a case under this chapter.  So, if they can \\n\\nbe heard on the plan finding or if they\\'re a \\n\\ncreditor, I guess I don\\'t understand why, on the \\n\\ntext of that provision, they can be so limited \\n\\nand say, well, you can\\'t bring up anything else, \\n\\neven though the -- the text says \"any issue.\" \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t limit it in that way. \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  I\\'ll address that in --\\n\\nin two respects.  So the plan finding, again, is \\n\\nthe question of whether they are a party in\\n\\n interest in the first place.  It\\'s a threshold\\n\\n question.  It\\'s like deciding jurisdiction or\\n\\n statutory standing.  And you have to get through \\n\\nthat to get to the merits.\\n\\n So, as an insurer, nothing about the \\n\\nplan finding changes whether or not Truck is a \\n\\nparty in interest.  They\\'re not. As to a \\n\\ncreditor, we\\'re talking about the right to \\n\\nobject to a particular plan that leaves them \\n\\nunimpaired.  And although 1109(b) has that \\n\\ngeneral language, 1126(f) more specifically says \\n\\nthat an unimpaired creditor is presumptively --\\n\\nis conclusively presumed to have accepted --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, Mr. Marshall, \\n\\nmaybe I\\'m not understanding about the plan \\n\\nfinding. I mean, it\\'s true that, at the end, \\n\\nthe court said that Truck wasn\\'t harmed.  But, \\n\\nyou know, what if the -- what if the court had \\n\\ndecided otherwise?  In the beginning, they don\\'t \\n\\nknow whether it\\'s going to be collusive or \\n\\nviolate Kaiser\\'s duty of good faith, right? \\n\\nMaybe I\\'m just misunderstanding.  I \\n\\n \\n\\nmean, it went in your favor, but --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Party-in-interest\\n\\n status is a threshold question.  You have the\\n\\n right to come in and litigate whether you\\'re a \\n\\nparty in interest or not. And that\\'s all the\\n\\n plan finding did.  It determined that their\\n\\n rights were not abridged and, therefore, they \\n\\nwere not a party in interest.\\n\\n JUSTICE JACKSON:  So -- but, Mr. --\\n\\nMr. Marshall --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  If that had gone \\n\\ndifferently, then, yes, they could have objected \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Marshall --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- to the rest of the \\n\\nplan, to the merits. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Marshall, you\\'ve \\n\\nagreed that they\\'re -- they were a party in \\n\\ninterest to the extent they were a creditor, \\n\\nright? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Yes. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  And normally a \\n\\ncreditor or a party in interest can be heard on \\n\\nany issue.  You agree with that? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  That\\'s the text of \\n\\n \\n\\n 1109(b).\\n\\n JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And you\\'ve \\n\\nbeen citing 1124 and 1126 to us, I understand \\n\\nand appreciate that, but that -- that governs\\n\\n who can vote, right? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  That is what it\\n\\n explicitly says, yes.\\n\\n JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It doesn\\'t talk \\n\\nabout what they can argue about or be heard on, \\n\\nright? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  It says they\\'re \\n\\nconclusively presumed to have accepted the plan. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  And an inference from \\n\\nthat is that it would be --\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  So -- but who can --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- absurd to vote to --\\n\\nin favor --\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  So, if you can\\'t \\n\\nvote, you can\\'t be heard?  Is that -- is that \\n\\nyour argument then? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  You can\\'t be heard on \\n\\nthe merits of the plan.  And that\\'s what the \\n\\ncircuit courts have said.  We cited cases and \\n\\nTruck cited some cases allegedly to the \\n\\n \\n\\n contrary, but they\\'re actually not, because all \\n\\nthey do is determine where -- whether the\\n\\n creditor that wants to object to the merits of \\n\\nthe plan is actually impaired.\\n\\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\\n\\n counsel.\\n\\n Justice Thomas?\\n\\n JUSTICE THOMAS:  No.\\n\\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice \\n\\nSotomayor? \\n\\nJustice Kagan? \\n\\nJustice Gorsuch? \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  No. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice \\n\\nKavanaugh? \\n\\nJustice Jackson? \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Can I just ask one \\n\\nquestion?  At the threshold, you keep saying at \\n\\nthe threshold they have no interest in the \\n\\nestate property. \\n\\nDo you dispute that they have a \\n\\npotential to have an interest in the estate \\n\\nproperty, that insurers do?  Because the plan \\n\\nisn\\'t in existence yet.  Do you -- do you \\n\\ndispute that they have the potential? \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  Borrowing from \\n\\nintervention law, the question would be when is\\n\\n their interest put at issue.  And it\\'s -- it\\'s\\n\\n somewhat like the -- which would be is a plan \\n\\nproposed that would breach your contract and \\n\\ngive you an interest in the estate. And it\\'s \\n\\nanalogous to what the actual history is with\\n\\n executory contracts.\\n\\n So the -- the -- the -- the -- the \\n\\nstatutory history that the government invokes \\n\\nactually says -- suggests you\\'re a party in \\n\\ninterest when there is a motion to reject an \\n\\nexecutory contract because that would create a \\n\\nclaim, a breach, and make you a creditor. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  I guess I don\\'t \\n\\nunderstand your answer, and I --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  So when -- when it\\'s \\n\\nput at issue. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  When it is put --\\n\\nwhy isn\\'t it put --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  If you\\'re an insurer, \\n\\nyou\\'re not on the list.  Nothing makes you --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Right --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- a party in interest. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  -- but the list says \\n\\n \\n\\n\"including,\" so we know there are things that\\n\\n are -- that are -- there are entities that may\\n\\n not be in the list, right?\\n\\n MR. MARSHALL:  Correct.\\n\\n JUSTICE JACKSON:  Okay.  So the \\n\\nquestion is they come to the table at the\\n\\n beginning and they say:  We think we should be \\n\\nin the list because we have a potential through \\n\\nthe reorganization plan that will be adopted to \\n\\nbe affected. \\n\\nAnd you say not party in interest \\n\\nbecause you\\'re not already affected or it\\'s not \\n\\nclear to us right now that you\\'re affected. Is \\n\\nthat your position? \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  If we\\'re talking about \\n\\nTruck as insurer --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- yes. \\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So --\\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  But once a plan is \\n\\nproposed --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  Right. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  -- that would breach \\n\\nyour contract --\\n\\nJUSTICE JACKSON:  So can I ask you, if \\n\\n \\n\\npeople who are not potentially affected are not \\n\\nparties in interest, I guess I don\\'t understand \\n\\nCongress\\'s suggestion that parties in interest \\n\\nshould be a part of the reorganization.\\n\\n In other words, the context in which\\n\\n their -- what -- what\\'s valuable to them about\\n\\n being a party in interest is the fact that they \\n\\nthen get to talk with everybody about how this \\n\\nis going to go. \\n\\nAnd the problem I\\'m having with your \\n\\nargument is it suggests that it\\'s only after we \\n\\nknow or after they know that they\\'re definitely \\n\\naffected that they get a -- a seat at the table, \\n\\nbut the whole point of it is that the parties in \\n\\ninterest get to talk about it. \\n\\nSo it seems to me it would have to \\n\\ninclude people who have a clear potential for \\n\\nbeing affected by the plan that we\\'re all \\n\\nhammering out in this discussion. \\n\\nMR. MARSHALL:  There\\'s nothing in \\n\\n1109(b) itself that says that has to be \\n\\ndetermined once and for all at the outset.  And \\n\\nif we\\'re talking about someone who\\'s not in the \\n\\nlist, the only way to know if you\\'re a party in \\n\\ninterest is do you have an interest in the \\n\\n \\n\\n bankruptcy estate.\\n\\n JUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\\n\\n counsel.\\n\\n Mr. Frederick.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT DAVID C. FREDERICK\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE CLAIMANT RESPONDENTS\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief \\n\\nJustice, and may it please the Court: \\n\\nThere are a number of questions I\\'d \\n\\nlike to address that you posed this morning, but \\n\\nI want to start with one principle, which is \\n\\nthat the Bankruptcy Code was not intended to \\n\\nprotect insurers, except in a couple of places \\n\\nwhere asbestos-related trusts are created, those \\n\\nare in Section 524(g) principally, but in 109, \\n\\nCongress said an insurer can\\'t invoke bankruptcy \\n\\nfor protections under the code. \\n\\nSo, Justice Kavanaugh, to your \\n\\nquestion about the text and practicalities, \\n\\nCongress answered the question of whether an \\n\\ninsurer should be permitted to butt into a \\n\\ndebtor\\'s bankruptcy and try to use it to protect \\n\\nits own financial interests.  The bankruptcy \\n\\nprocess is designed to ensure that the debtor \\n\\n \\n\\ncan maximize its assets for the benefit of\\n\\n creditors.\\n\\n And so what the insurer as insurer is\\n\\n doing here is seeking to co-opt the debtor\\'s \\n\\nbankruptcy for the purpose of protecting its own\\n\\n interests.\\n\\n Justice Thomas, I can start with the\\n\\n timing question if you like.\\n\\n JUSTICE THOMAS:  Well, let -- well, \\n\\nyou can start with that, but also I think that \\n\\nthe -- their interest isn\\'t so much in \\n\\nfeathering their own nest per se but, rather, \\n\\nthat they be treated with the anti-fraud \\n\\nprovisions the same way that the claims under \\n\\nthe trust are being treated. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  And let me start \\n\\nwith -- the -- the -- I\\'m going to call these \\n\\npretrial disclosure requirements because Truck \\n\\nhad six months of discovery to try to prove any \\n\\nfraud with the Kaiser claimants and came up with \\n\\ncrickets. \\n\\nWhat they are calling anti-fraud \\n\\nprevention measures are really requirements to \\n\\nimpose on state courts that before a claimant \\n\\ncan file a claim, a claimant has to comply with \\n\\n \\n\\nwhat Truck wants for information that a state\\n\\n court might or might not require under state\\n\\n court rules of procedure.\\n\\n So, if you were to accept the idea \\n\\nthat their nomenclature drives the outcome here, \\n\\nyou\\'re essentially saying bankruptcy courts have\\n\\n the authority to tell state courts how to do\\n\\n their discovery process.\\n\\n           And, Justice Barrett, that\\'s why we\\'re \\n\\nfighting this, because the claimants shouldn\\'t \\n\\nbe required to impose on themselves and their \\n\\nfamilies a lot of information that if Truck \\n\\nreally wanted it, it could ask for it in state \\n\\ncourt discovery proceedings and state court \\n\\njudges could decide --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Frederick --\\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  -- is that relevant or \\n\\nburdensome or not. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- why do all \\n\\nthese other circuits and other bankruptcy courts \\n\\nimpose it? If they felt the same way that \\n\\nyou\\'re arguing, are they violating the \\n\\nBankruptcy Code by -- or -- or disrespecting \\n\\nstate courts because that\\'s what they require? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  No. The requirements \\n\\n \\n\\nhere are only for a very small class of claims\\n\\n that are called extraordinary claims.  And they\\n\\n are extraordinary claims, it\\'s defined at JA \\n\\n427, under the plan. These are not insured \\n\\nclaims where the claimant is seeking to say that \\n\\nKaiser was responsible for the vast bulk of its\\n\\n exposure to asbestos.\\n\\n And in that very unusual circumstance,\\n\\n which actually in the implementation of this \\n\\nplan hasn\\'t arisen yet, the requirement is for \\n\\nthat claimant to come forward with proof of a \\n\\nnegative, that it hadn\\'t been exposed to \\n\\nasbestos by any other potential tortfeasor.  And \\n\\nso we\\'re talking about a very narrow class with \\n\\na description for a very particularized purpose \\n\\nthat Truck wants to appropriate and force so \\n\\nthat claimants will have less of an opportunity \\n\\nto invoke their jury trial rights in state \\n\\ncourt, which are protected under the U.S. Code. \\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why -- why \\n\\nshould you as the debtor trust have that \\n\\nadvantage and not give it to them? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  Because --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that\\'s the \\n\\ndifference in treatment that they\\'re claiming is \\n\\n \\n\\n contrary to the plan.\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  It\\'s not for this\\n\\n reason.  The -- the treatment by Kaiser of Truck \\n\\nis exactly the same before bankruptcy as it was\\n\\n now. Truck agreed contractually --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But bankruptcy \\n\\nchanges everyone. It changes who the debtor is\\n\\n to the trust.  It -- by its own terms, it\\'s\\n\\n extinguishing the debtor\\'s obligation --\\n\\nobligations to anyone, except under the extant \\n\\ncontract, but the incentives are different. \\n\\nThere is inherent change. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  That\\'s why the \\n\\nprinciple of insurance neutrality, which was \\n\\ndeveloped 30 years ago in the courts of appeals \\n\\nand has actually followed in every single court \\n\\nof appeals that has addressed this question, has \\n\\nlooked at whether the insurers\\' legal \\n\\nobligations are altered, and if they are not --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You\\'re still --\\n\\nthen circle back to my initial question.  Other \\n\\nbankruptcy courts have imposed these same \\n\\nrequirements and they\\'ve done it.  Are they \\n\\nbreaching bankruptcy law?  Are they stepping on \\n\\nstate courts in an improper way? What are they \\n\\n \\n\\ndoing? And why are you fighting something that \\n\\nyou admit your claimants in discovery might well \\n\\nhave to give up?\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  Because it\\'s up to the\\n\\n state court to decide that.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  Because they are the\\n\\n ones that will be superintending discovery.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what -- what \\n\\ndoes that have to do with the --\\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  Because the -- because \\n\\nJUST SOTOMAYOR:  What does that have \\n\\nto do with anything?  Meaning, you know, if --\\n\\nif -- you eventually in -- in most jurisdictions \\n\\nwill have to give up something like that because \\n\\nthere is very few jurisdictions who would say \\n\\nthey have to pay the entire cost if there\\'s \\n\\nmultiple exposures or they have to pay the \\n\\nentire cost if other people have paid you. \\n\\nThat\\'s all that\\'s being sought. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  It\\'s more than that, \\n\\nJustice Sotomayor, which is why they\\'re fighting \\n\\nso hard for it.  And -- and I want to make this \\n\\nvery clear, that the point of the extraordinary \\n\\n \\n\\nprocedure is because the trust itself is having\\n\\n to pay the claims.  They are not insured by\\n\\n definition.  And to protect --\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That\\'s the whole\\n\\n point.\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  No.\\n\\n JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You\\'re trying to \\n\\ngive yourself something more than you\\'re giving\\n\\n someone else, and you want to reach into their \\n\\npocket and say I\\'ll give myself more than you. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  Because the contract \\n\\nof insurance, which they litigated for 19 years \\n\\nin California state courts, definitively \\n\\ndetermined they will have to pay the claimants \\n\\nwho are insured --\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Frederick --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So I think I\\'m getting \\n\\nthe equities of this, Mr. Frederick, as you \\n\\ndescribe it, is that they had a contract and \\n\\nthey\\'ve been protected as to that contract, and \\n\\nthey\\'re just looking to get a better deal now \\n\\nand to kind of take advantage of the bankruptcy. \\n\\nSo I\\'m getting the equities here. \\n\\nI\\'m not getting where you derive from \\n\\nthe text the idea that they\\'re not parties in \\n\\n \\n\\ninterest because they have a material interest \\n\\nin what comes out of the bankruptcy proceeding, \\n\\nand they can improve their position materially \\n\\nin the bankruptcy proceeding.\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  The cases that we cite \\n\\nhistorically under the Transportation Act of \\n\\n1920 make very clear that if you\\'re just seeking \\n\\na benefit, you don\\'t get party-in-interest\\n\\n status.  You have to show aggrievement and harm \\n\\nto your pre-position. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:  So those are some \\n\\n1920s cases.  Do you have anything in the text \\n\\nthat can suggest that the text has incorporated \\n\\nthat view? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  We don\\'t have anything \\n\\nlike that, although I would point to the history \\n\\nthat the Debtors\\' brief very helpfully lays out, \\n\\nwhich explains how the original -- origination \\n\\nof the Bankruptcy Code went through these \\n\\niterations and accepted those principles for \\n\\nparty in interest. \\n\\nAnd -- and I think that it makes sense \\n\\nfrom an Article III perspective too because the \\n\\nother side is essentially saying Article III has \\n\\nno role to play here, where a bankruptcy process \\n\\n \\n\\nis a multifaceted fight over a res. What is the\\n\\n debtor\\'s estate?  Who gets that property?\\n\\n And so those claims are going to be \\n\\nsomewhat flowing in and out.  And it is\\n\\n imperative in the 524(g) context that you\\n\\n recognize Article III has a role to play.  Why? \\n\\nBecause the district court has to enter the\\n\\n final injunction.  The bankruptcy court does not \\n\\nhave the authority to do that under the statute. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Frederick, I \\n\\ncertainly get your arguments and why they might \\n\\npersuade a bankruptcy court to rule for you and \\n\\nnot require these anti-fraud provisions. \\n\\nBut I think you\\'ve admitted that a \\n\\ncourt can do those provisions and they have done \\n\\nthem in other cases lawfully, right? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  For the trust\\'s \\n\\nbenefit, but not where there\\'s an insurance \\n\\nneutrality --\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  -- clause. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  So -- so -- so the \\n\\nquestion becomes, can they be heard?  That --\\n\\nthat\\'s the only question before us.  Can they be \\n\\nheard at all?  And I -- I guess I\\'m -- I\\'m \\n\\n \\n\\n struggling on that one.\\n\\n We\\'re not discussing the power of the\\n\\n court. We\\'re not discussing what it might rule.\\n\\n We\\'re only discussing who can be heard.  And I\\n\\n think you -- you have to acknowledge that there \\n\\nare creditors who can be heard, even if it\\'s a \\n\\nvirtual certainty that they will get nothing or \\n\\na virtual certainty they will get a hundred\\n\\n cents on the dollar. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  Right. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  They still can be \\n\\nheard. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  They can be heard \\n\\nuntil the point where their impairment is \\n\\ndetermined. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, they -- they \\n\\n-- they -- they may not have a vote, but they \\n\\ncan be heard on any issue.  No? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK: Until their impairment \\n\\nhas been determined, Justice Gorsuch.  That\\'s \\n\\nthe key point.  That\\'s --\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where do you get \\n\\nthat from? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  1126(f). \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  That\\'s -- that\\'s who \\n\\n \\n\\nvotes.\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  But the point of \\n\\nvoting is who can hear, and the whole point of \\n\\nthe chart which you can see the bankruptcy \\n\\ncourt\\'s determination, is who\\'s impaired or not \\n\\nbecause the bankruptcy court has to get to an \\n\\nend place. There were a dozen insurers here,\\n\\n and under their position, there is no limiting\\n\\n principle to any of those insurers who could \\n\\ncontinue to fight because they want to get \\n\\nbenefits out of a bankruptcy process that \\n\\nCongress foreclosed to them. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do you agree on \\n\\nArticle III that -- that that\\'s with respect to \\n\\na plaintiff coming to court and not with respect \\n\\nto those who object under Bond and Clapper? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  No, I don\\'t agree with \\n\\nthat. \\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH: You disagree with \\n\\nBond and Clapper on that? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  I think that -- I \\n\\nthink Clapper is actually more helpful for our \\n\\nside, Justice --\\n\\nJUSTICE GORSUCH:  What about Bond? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  Bond, I think that the \\n\\n \\n\\npoint is where the effort by the objector in\\n\\n this situation is seeking to get a benefit and\\n\\n must show under Article III that it has injury \\n\\nin fact that is redressable and traceable to the\\n\\n plan.\\n\\n           Here, Truck can\\'t satisfy either \\n\\nbecause its redressability problem is really \\n\\nbecause they think state courts are not going to \\n\\nbe adequate to police fraud, and they don\\'t --\\n\\nthey are not able to trace their harm as insurer \\n\\nto the plan because of the insurance neutrality \\n\\nprovision. \\n\\nAnd so I think there\\'s a very serious \\n\\nArticle III question here that Truck has \\n\\nessentially glided by in this argument this \\n\\nmorning, but I want to urge you to take that \\n\\nvery seriously because it can\\'t be the case that \\n\\nwe have, like, a law school seminar or anybody \\n\\nwho wants to come and talk gets to talk.  The \\n\\nwhole point of a bankruptcy proceeding is get to \\n\\na confirmed plan, and the only way to do that is \\n\\nto weed out the people who have something that \\n\\nthey want to say and to have different threshold \\n\\nprovisions. \\n\\nSo, Justice Thomas, I wanted to get \\n\\n \\n\\nback to your timing question. At the disclosure\\n\\n statement, the -- the -- the debtor has to\\n\\n present a plan.  That is where the issues of \\n\\ninsurance neutrality typically are going to be\\n\\n addressed.  And at confirmation, we are knowing\\n\\n then that the creditor is impaired or not\\n\\n impaired.\\n\\n So those are the two key timing\\n\\n mechanisms.  It can\\'t be at the outset of a \\n\\nbankruptcy because there isn\\'t enough known \\n\\nabout the nature of the estate --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if he\\'s \\n\\nnot impaired, doesn\\'t he have an interest in \\n\\nmaking sure that doesn\\'t change? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  He does, but that\\'s \\n\\nwhere the confirmation of the plan comes in. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why, if you look at the chart, Mr. \\n\\nChief Justice, there\\'s a -- this group is \\n\\nunimpaired, this group is unimpaired because \\n\\nthey are paid in full. \\n\\nAnd Truck was paid in full for its \\n\\npremiums.  So it is not an executory contract, \\n\\nwhich, under the Vern Countryman definition, was \\n\\nwhere there was -- lack of performance on both \\n\\nsides of the contract.  Here, the Debtor \\n\\n \\n\\n performed on the contract.  The Debtor paid all\\n\\n the premiums. \\n\\nAnd so it is a non-executory contract,\\n\\n which I think helps give the lie to the \\n\\ngovernment\\'s position that calling something an\\n\\n executory contract is somehow going to solve the\\n\\n problem here, where you\\'ve got performance that\\n\\n is occurring at different levels and at\\n\\n different stages. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why the DOJ policy manual \\n\\nitself says be very careful about invoking \\n\\nexecutory contracts because they\\'re not defined \\n\\nin the bankruptcy code and it\\'s very difficult \\n\\nto know how to administer them in practice. \\n\\nAnd so for the government to be \\n\\nsuggesting that you have a test here that is so \\n\\nmalleable, where the interests of claimants and \\n\\ncreditors is critically important to \\n\\nunderstanding how to weed out the various \\n\\nmuckrakers, where the United -- and I would \\n\\npoint you to the policyholders\\' brief, pages 12 \\n\\nto 14, which talks about just how long the \\n\\ninsurers have an interest.  Why? Delay is \\n\\nprofit-maximizing.  Every day insurers do not \\n\\nhave to pay on their claims is a good day for \\n\\n \\n\\nthe insurers, and so they have every incentive \\n\\nto tell their lawyers: Go in and object to \\n\\neverything because that will delay the process.\\n\\n We could have had this plan confirmed\\n\\n five years ago.  The only objector was Truck.\\n\\n Every other insurance company agreed to the \\n\\nplan. And so, by adopting some rule that \\n\\neverybody gets to be heard and everybody gets to\\n\\n participate --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Truck -- isn\\'t Truck \\n\\non the hook for the majority of claims? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK: Truck and other \\n\\ninsurers. \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  But doesn\\'t -- isn\\'t \\n\\nTruck responsible for the lion\\'s share? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  That\\'s what they say, \\n\\nand I have no reason to doubt it.  But, Justice \\n\\nBarrett, where do you draw the line there?  Do \\n\\nyou say they\\'re an insurer that\\'s responsible \\n\\nfor two-thirds gets it? We heard the --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  I -- I -- I was just \\n\\nsaying that it means less that other insurers \\n\\ndidn\\'t object if they didn\\'t have the same stake \\n\\nin the claims. \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  We don\\'t know what the \\n\\n \\n\\n comparative issues are.  The excess insurance\\n\\n part is under a confidentiality standard that I \\n\\nhave not seen, and I can\\'t tell you in court\\n\\n what that entails.\\n\\n JUSTICE BARRETT:  Could you be a party \\n\\nin interest at the --\\n\\n           MR. FREDERICK: But what I can say, \\n\\nJustice Barrett, is that it can\\'t be a size\\n\\n issue because there\\'s no way to draw a line on a \\n\\nsize issue.  What do you say?  It\\'s a quarter is \\n\\nenough, or six insurance companies, that each \\n\\nhave an equal stake, is enough?  How do you --\\n\\nthere\\'s no --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Can I ask you a \\n\\ntiming question? Can you be a party in \\n\\ninterest -- I\\'m just trying to understand your \\n\\npoint about how things change as the -- as the \\n\\nplans develop. \\n\\nChief, do you want me to --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

Is that what you\\'re\\n\\n saying?\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  I\\'m saying that\\n\\n impairment is treated differently.  So you can\\n\\n be a creditor --\\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah.\\n\\n MR.

FREDERICK:  The -- the code treats \\n\\nthat differently.  And it\\'s odd to suppose that \\n\\nan unenumerated party like an insurance company \\n\\nis treated better than an insurance -- than a --\\n\\nthan a creditor. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, \\n\\ncounsel. \\n\\nI just want to follow up.  You were \\n\\njust making the point that you can\\'t draw that \\n\\nline. \\n\\nI mean, the law does that all the \\n\\ntime, right?  I don\\'t care where it is and it \\n\\nmay be the majority or a significant part of it \\n\\nor whatever. \\n\\n \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  And -- and that\\'s why \\n\\nI think looking to the guidance of the courts of \\n\\nappeals is actually humbling at one level but\\n\\n also instructive.\\n\\n For 30 years, courts of appeals have\\n\\n looked at this idea of insurance neutrality to\\n\\n determine whether a plan is materially altering\\n\\n preexisting legal obligations.\\n\\n In those cases where the court has \\n\\nsaid yes, it is, insurance companies are allowed \\n\\nto be parties in interest.  That\\'s the Thorpe \\n\\ncase out of the Ninth Circuit, the Global case \\n\\nout of the Third Circuit. \\n\\nBut, in those situations where there\\'s \\n\\nan insurance neutrality provision and the \\n\\ninsurance company is not able to say with any \\n\\nproof that its legal obligations are materially \\n\\naltered, the courts of appeals have said: \\n\\nYou\\'re not a party in interest. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn\\'t \\n\\nTruck want to have something to say about the --\\n\\nthe division that you\\'ve just cited? \\n\\nMR. FREDERICK:  And they do, Mr. Chief \\n\\nJustice, because that issue is litigated.  When \\n\\nmy friend was talking about this being at the \\n\\n \\n\\nthreshold, the whole question is, is the\\n\\n insurance company\\'s legal obligations, are they \\n\\nimpaired or not? And that fight is a very\\n\\n vigorous fight in --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but\\n\\n it\\'s -- it -- that fight continues beyond what\\n\\n you\\'re calling the threshold.\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  It -- it -- it does \\n\\nand it is. But, at a point where the plan is \\n\\nconfirmed and we know there will be insurance \\n\\nneutrality, and we know that their rights as a \\n\\ncreditor are not giving them a right to vote, at \\n\\nthat point, it should stop and the four years \\n\\nthat we spent doing appellate litigation here \\n\\nought not to be necessary. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice \\n\\nThomas? \\n\\nJustice Sotomayor? \\n\\nJustice Kagan? \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Can I just ask \\n\\nbecause you called them muckrakers? \\n\\n(Laughter.) \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The -- the amicus \\n\\nbrief for the professors on the other side, and \\n\\nyou can just respond to this, says, \"Indeed, \\n\\n \\n\\nwhen an insurer faces millions of dollars in\\n\\n financial liability, like Petitioner does here, \\n\\ncommon sense and fundamental bankruptcy policy \\n\\ndictate that it be considered a party in\\n\\n interest in the bankruptcy proceeding.\"\\n\\n So you can just -- I mean, this is\\n\\n repeating what you\\'ve said probably, but that\\n\\n sounds different from muckrakers.\\n\\n MR. FREDERICK:  Well, what I would \\n\\nsay, Justice Kavanaugh, is that a party in \\n\\ninterest has extraordinary rights.  They have \\n\\nthe right to contest the trustee, the \\n\\nappointment, the powers of the trustee.  They \\n\\ncan object to the lifting of the automatic stay. \\n\\nThey can ask for the elimination of a plan. \\n\\nThey can ask for the transformation of it from a \\n\\nChapter 11 to a Chapter 7. \\n\\nAnd those powers are -- are -- are and \\n\\nrights are very powerful and they take \\n\\nbankruptcy courts an enormous amount of time to \\n\\nthoughtfully and conscientiously work their way \\n\\nthrough. \\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice \\n\\nBarrett? \\n\\n \\n\\nJUSTICE BARRETT:  No.\\n\\n CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice\\n\\n Jackson?\\n\\n Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n MR.

HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. \\n\\nThree points.  Two quick and one a little bit \\n\\nlonger. \\n\\nOne, just to really underscore \\n\\n1126(f), that is about voting.  That is not \\n\\nabout what 1109(b) about, which is being heard, \\n\\ntwo very different things. \\n\\nNumber two, on intervention, Congress \\n\\ndid away with the requirement that parties in \\n\\ninterest must intervene when it replaced 206 and \\n\\n207 with 1109(b). \\n\\nAnd three, my -- my friends have \\n\\ntalked a lot about the insurer in this case \\n\\ntrying to get something out of the bankruptcy or \\n\\nseek a benefit. \\n\\nTrying to stem the tide of over \\n\\n \\n\\n inflated claims is not seeking a benefit.  It\\'s \\n\\njust trying to make sure that the plan complies \\n\\nwith the code as bankruptcy judges have an \\n\\nindependent duty to ensure.\\n\\n And even if you disagree with me on\\n\\n that, it\\'s -- it\\'s undisputed that Truck is \\n\\ngoing to pay the vast bulk of claims in this \\n\\ncase, that the plan finding adjudicates Truck\\'s \\n\\ninsurance rights, that Truck is a creditor \\n\\nbecause the insurance deductible, so it really \\n\\nis a party in interest several times over.  And \\n\\nI haven\\'t heard from my friends on the other \\n\\nside any justification for reading any issues \\n\\nout of the text. \\n\\n1109(b) gives stakeholders a voice, \\n\\nnot a vote and certainly not a veto.  We would \\n\\nrespectfully ask the Court to reverse and \\n\\nremand. \\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, \\n\\ncounsel. \\n\\nMS.

That rule, which my \\n\\nfriends barely defend, violates the text, \\n\\ncontext, and history of 1109(b). \\n\\nIt also defies the practical reality \\n\\nthat Chapter 11 cases are, as this Court has \\n\\nrecognized, collaborative, working best when all \\n\\nstakeholders come together at the outset to hash \\n\\nthings out. \\n\\nCongress recognized that reality and \\n\\n \\n\\n spoke expansively in 1109(b) to extend the right\\n\\n to be heard to any issue.  Congress also gave \\n\\ncourts a duty to ensure compliance with the code \\n\\nand invited broad participation to help\\n\\n discharge that duty.  1109(b)'s breadth is a \\n\\nfeature, not a bug.\\n\\n It's now common ground that a party in \\n\\ninterest is one who could be directly and\\n\\n adversely affected by the case.  That's Truck in \\n\\nat least two ways. \\n\\nFirst, it's the insurer paying the \\n\\nvast bulk of claims against the debtors.  In the \\n\\ngovernment's terms, it's a contracting party. \\n\\nFrom the start then, Truck's rights could have \\n\\nbeen directly and adversely affected by this \\n\\ncase. The proof of that pudding is in the plan \\n\\nfinding, which resolved key -- a key coverage \\n\\ndispute against Truck. \\n\\nSecond, Truck's a creditor for \\n\\nmillions in insurance deductibles. \\n\\nFor both reasons, 1109(b)'s plain \\n\\nterms entitle Truck to be heard on any issue. \\n\\nIn silencing Truck, the Fourth Circuit \\n\\nviolated those terms by limiting who a party in \\n\\ninterest is and what issues they can raise. \\n\\n \\n\\nI welcome the Court's questions.\",\n",

Maybe you just, \\n\\nyou know, don\\'t know what the effect is going to \\n\\nbe, and a lot of people who could be parties in \\n\\ninterest, just because it doesn\\'t fit into the \\n\\n-- it doesn\\'t make rational economic sense, they \\n\\ndon\\'t participate, right?  They just don\\'t \\n\\nparticipate until -- they have a right to, but \\n\\nthey don\\'t until it becomes relevant. \\n\\nThe pre-Bankruptcy Act -- Code Act \\n\\nlabels executory contractors as parties in \\n\\ninterest.  Why? It\\'s because they had to get \\n\\n \\n\\nadvance notice of rejection. And there\\'s a case \\n\\ncalled King versus Baer of the Tenth Circuit,\\n\\n 1973, it explains that -- you give them notice \\n\\nin a hearing so they can be heard.\\n\\n Currently, the current code says that\\n\\n the -- the counterparty can seek an order to set\\n\\n a period to assume or reject.  That\\'s 365(d)(2).\\n\\n Other parties in interest may similarly set --\\n\\nset that same period, but they can only do so in \\n\\nthe context of status conferences.  That\\'s \\n\\n105(d)(2)(A).  All of this is showing that \\n\\nparties in interest -- that -- that executory \\n\\ncounter -- contract counterparties are parties \\n\\nin interest. \\n\\nNow there\\'s a few things that I\\'d like \\n\\nto address.  One is there\\'s a question about \\n\\nhaving a voice and not a vote. I think that \\n\\ngoes to the question of being impaired. \\n\\nImpaired is what the plan under Section 1124 \\n\\nproposes.  But there are other requirements for \\n\\na plan.  For instance, a plan needs to be \\n\\nfeasible. So, if you\\'re a creditor and the plan \\n\\nproposes satisfying everything, but it satisfies \\n\\nit in a way that\\'s not likely to end up being \\n\\nimplemented -- you can object under 1129(a), I \\n\\n \\n\\nthink it\\'s (a)(11), that the plan\\'s not\\n\\n feasible.\\n\\n So the impairment just talks about the\\n\\n separate requirement that the classes vote.  It\\n\\n doesn\\'t set -- address your right to be heard,\\n\\n which, by the way, is not only a right to be \\n\\nheard to object, but it\\'s a right to be heard to\\n\\n support the plan, right?  If you\\'re not\\n\\n impaired, you may well want to come in and \\n\\nsupport the plan. \\n\\nThe floodgates question, it largely \\n\\nturns, I think, on the question of any issue, \\n\\nnot the problem of party in interest.  Like \\n\\ntake, for instance, the vending contractor that \\n\\n-- that everyone\\'s talking about. The problem \\n\\nis not that a vending contractor gets to come in \\n\\nand be a party in interest and participate with \\n\\nrespect to the vending contract, whether it\\'s \\n\\nassumed or rejected or interpreted in a way it \\n\\ndoesn\\'t like.

       " 'MR. MARSHALL',\n",
       " \"  Mr. Chief Justice, and \\n\\nmay it please the Court: \\n\\nA party in interest is someone who has \\n\\na legal interest in a debtor's bankruptcy \\n\\nestate, its property, not someone who is merely \\n\\nconcerned about the debtor's bankruptcy more \\n\\ngenerally. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe list of parties in interest in\\n\\n Section 1109(b) shows this.  Settled usage of \\n\\nthe term in bankruptcy confirms it. And the \\n\\ngovernment, at least in its brief, agrees with\\n\\n it.\\n\\n At the outset of the case, the parties \\n\\nin interest will ordinarily be the debtor with \\n\\nits creditors and shareholders, those whom\\n\\n Section 1109(b) lists. \\n\\nOthers, as Justice Thomas was asking \\n\\nabout, may come to have an interest in the \\n\\nestate and, thus, can show that the bankruptcy \\n\\nwill directly affect their rights or \\n\\nobligations.  For example, if a plan would \\n\\nbreach an insurer's policy, altering its \\n\\ncontract rights or obligations, then it would \\n\\nbecome a party in interest. \\n\\nBut, if a plan preserves the insurer's \\n\\nstatus quo, it is insurance neutral, in that \\n\\ncase, the insurer is not a party in interest and \\n\\nit has no right to object to plan confirmation. \\n\\nHere, the plan does not alter Truck's \\n\\ncontract rights or obligations.  It breaches \\n\\nnothing.  It does not do anything to put Truck \\n\\non the hook.  That is what the lower courts \\n\\n \\n\\nuniformly found, and Truck here does not\\n\\n challenge that finding.  Truck, therefore, has \\n\\nno right to challenge plan confirmation.\\n\\n Truck invokes policy concerns that \\n\\nwould supplant this settled clear rule with a\\n\\n novel expansive framework that would give \\n\\ninsurers greater rights to challenge plan \\n\\nconfirmation than even a creditor has. But\\n\\n bankruptcy law already addresses these concerns \\n\\nby allowing interested entities that are not \\n\\nparties in interest to pursue permissive \\n\\nintervention.  Truck simply ignores that tool. \\n\\nI welcome the Court's questions. \",\n",

At the disclosure\\n\\n statement, the -- the -- the debtor has to\\n\\n present a plan.  That is where the issues of \\n\\ninsurance neutrality typically are going to be\\n\\n addressed.

BLATT', 'words': ' Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 666 applies to 19 million state, local, and tribal officials and anyone else whose employer receives federal benefits, including 14 million Medicare-funded healthcare workers. Congress did not plausibly subject all of these people to 10 years in prison just for accepting gifts, especially when federal officials face only two years for accepting gifts under 201(c). 666 punishes corruptly receiving anything of value intending to be influenced or rewarded. \"Corruptly [...] intending to be influenced\" covers classic bribes, where officials get upfront payments in exchange for official conduct, while \"corruptly [...] intending to be rewarded\" covers bribes paid after the fact and to officials who aren\\'t actually influenced. The government argues \"corruptly\" under 666 means wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. But the government tried this case and countless others on the theory that \"corruptly\" just meant knowingly. Regardless, the government\\'s new definition is implausible and stunningly vague. No gratuity statute -- that\\'s none whatsoever -- uses the word \"corruptly\" and for good reason. The government can\\'t tell you what gifts are corrupts -- are corrupt. What gift is too much for the doctor who saves your life? Is pornography an immoral gift? The federalism and due process implications of the government\\'s view are gobsmacking. All states prohibit bribery, but localities and states take an -- infinite approaches to gifts and outside compensation. Affirmance would let federal prosecutors second-guess all of these judgments. Meanwhile, state and local officials will have no way of knowing what gift would subject them to 10 years in prison. Remember, extensive guidance tells federal employees that accepting anything over $20 is a crime. It would be downright Kafkaesque to subject state and local officials to a standardless and severe regime where federal interests are at their weakest. I welcome questions.'}\n",

MITCHELL \\n\\n7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER \\n\\n8 MR. MITCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may \\n\\n9 it please the Court: \\n\\n10 The Colorado Supreme Court held that \\n\\n11   President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally \\n\\n12   disqualified from serving as president under \\n\\n13 Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Colorado \\n\\n14 Supreme Court\\'s decision is wrong and should be \\n\\n15   reversed for numerous independent reasons. \\n\\n16 The first reason is that President Trump is \\n\\n17 not covered by Section 3 because the president is not \\n\\n18 \"an officer of the United States\" as that term is \\n\\n19 used throughout the Constitution.  \"Officer of the \\n\\n20   United States\" refers only to appointed officials, \\n\\n21 and it does not encompass elected individuals, such \\n\\n22 as the President or members of Congress.  This is \\n\\n23 clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment \\n\\n24 Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which \\n\\n25 uses \"officers of the United States\" to refer only to \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n4 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   appointed and not elected officials. \\n\\n2 The second reason is that Section 3 cannot \\n\\n3 be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the \\n\\n4 ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from \\n\\n5 serving as president under Section 3 because Congress \\n\\n6 can lift that disability after the candidate is \\n\\n7 elected but before he takes office.  A state cannot \\n\\n8 exclude any candidate for federal office from the \\n\\n9 ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that \\n\\n10 does so is violating the holding of Term Limits by \\n\\n11   altering the Constitution\\'s qualifications for \\n\\n12 federal office. \\n\\n13 The Colorado Supreme Court\\'s decision is no \\n\\n14   different from a state residency law that requires \\n\\n15 members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to \\n\\n16 Election Day, when the Constitution requires only \\n\\n17 that members of Congress inhabit the state that they \\n\\n18   represent when elected. \\n\\n19 In both situations, a state is accelerating \\n\\n20 the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed \\n\\n21   qualification and is thereby violating the holding of \\n\\n22 Term Limits.  And in this situation, a ruling from \\n\\n23 this Court that affirms the decision below would not \\n\\n24 only violate Term Limits but take away the votes of \\n\\n25   potentially tens of millions of Americans. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n5 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 I welcome the Court\\'s questions. \\n\\n2 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Mr. Mitchell, would you --\\n\\n3 you didn\\'t spend much time on your argument with \\n\\n4 respect to whether or not Section 3 is \\n\\n5   self-executing, so would you address that? \\n\\n6 And -- and in doing that, your argument is \\n\\n7 that it\\'s not self-executing, but then, in that case, \\n\\n8 what would the role of the state be, or is it \\n\\n9   entirely up to Congress to implement the \\n\\n10   disqualification in Section 3? \\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  It is entirely up to \\n\\n12   Congress, Justice Thomas.  And our argument goes \\n\\n13   beyond actually saying that Section 3 is \\n\\n14   non-self-executing.  We need to say something more \\n\\n15 than that because a non-self-executing treaty or a \\n\\n16   non-self-executing constitutional provision normally \\n\\n17 can still be enforced by a state if it chooses to \\n\\n18 enact legislation. \\n\\n19 The holding of Griffin\\'s Case goes beyond \\n\\n20 even that by saying that a state is not allowed to \\n\\n21   implement or enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth \\n\\n22   Amendment unless and until Congress enacts \\n\\n23   implementing legislation allowing it to do so. So, \\n\\n24 under Griffin\\'s Case, which we believe is correctly \\n\\n25 decided -- the Anderson litigants disagree with us on \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n6 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 that point -- but, if this Court were to adhere to \\n\\n2 the holding of Griffin\\'s Case, there would not be any \\n\\n3 role for the states in enforcing Section 3 unless \\n\\n4   Congress were to enact a statute that gives them that \\n\\n5   authority. \\n\\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what if \\n\\n7 somebody came into a state secretary of state\\'s \\n\\n8   office and said, I took the oath specified in Section \\n\\n9 3, I participated in an insurrection, and I want to \\n\\n10 be on the ballot?  Can the -- does the secretary of \\n\\n11 state have the authority in that situation to say, \\n\\n12   no, you\\'re disqualified? \\n\\n13 MR. MITCHELL:  No, the secretary of state \\n\\n14 could not do that, consistent with Term Limits, \\n\\n15 because even if the candidate is an admitted \\n\\n16   insurrectionist, Section 3 still allows the candidate \\n\\n17 to run for office and even win election to office and \\n\\n18 then see whether Congress lifts that disability after \\n\\n19 the election. \\n\\n20 This happened frequently in the wake of the \\n\\n21   Fourteenth Amendment, where Confederate \\n\\n22 insurrectionists were elected to Congress, and \\n\\n23   sometimes they obtained a waiver; sometimes they did \\n\\n24 not. And each House would determine for itself \\n\\n25 whether to seat that elected insurrectionist because \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n7 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 each House is the sole judge of the qualifications of \\n\\n2 its members. \\n\\n3 So, if a state banned even an admitted \\n\\n4   insurrectionist from the ballot, it would be adding \\n\\n5 to and altering the Constitution\\'s qualifications for \\n\\n6 office because, under Section 3, the candidate need \\n\\n7 only qualify during the time the candidate holds the \\n\\n8 office to which he\\'s been elected.  And under Your \\n\\n9 Honor\\'s hypothetical, the secretary of state would be \\n\\n10 demanding essentially that the candidate obtain a \\n\\n11 waiver from Congress earlier than the candidate needs \\n\\n12 to obtain that waiver. \\n\\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even though \\n\\n14 it\\'s pretty unlikely or at least would be difficult \\n\\n15 for an individual who says, you know, I -- I am an \\n\\n16   insurrectionist and I had taken the oath, that would \\n\\n17 require a two-thirds of votes in Congress, right? \\n\\n18 MR. MITCHELL:  Correct. \\n\\n19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that\\'s a \\n\\n20   pretty unlikely scenario. \\n\\n21 MR. MITCHELL:  It may be unlikely, but no \\n\\n22 secretary of state is permitted to predict the \\n\\n23   likelihood of a waiver because, in doing so, they\\'re \\n\\n24 adding a new qualification to the ability to run for \\n\\n25   Congress. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n8 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 And the proper analogy, Mr. Chief Justice, \\n\\n2 is to state residency laws because the Constitution \\n\\n3 says that a member of Congress must inhabit the state \\n\\n4 that he represents when elected.  And the lower \\n\\n5 courts have all held, in reliance on Term Limits, \\n\\n6 that a state election official cannot move that \\n\\n7   deadline any earlier by requiring the candidate for \\n\\n8   Congress to inhabit the state --\\n\\n9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if somebody \\n\\n10 --\\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  -- before the date of \\n\\n12   election. \\n\\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- comes in and \\n\\n14 says, I\\'m -- I\\'m a -- a resident of -- to the \\n\\n15 secretary of state\\'s office in Illinois and says, I\\'m \\n\\n16 a -- a resident of Indiana, I have been all my life, \\n\\n17 I want to run for office in Illinois, the secretary \\n\\n18 of state can\\'t say, no, you can\\'t? \\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, the question would be \\n\\n20 is that person going to inhabit the state when the \\n\\n21   election is held.  So, if the candidate makes clear, \\n\\n22 perhaps through a sworn declaration or through his \\n\\n23 own statements, that he has no intention of \\n\\n24   relocating to that state before Election Day, then \\n\\n25 the secretary of state would be enforcing an extant \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n9 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   constitutional qualification rather than enforcing a \\n\\n2 new state-imposed qualification. \\n\\n3 And that\\'s the key under Term Limits:  Is \\n\\n4 the state in any way altering the criteria for a \\n\\n5 federal office, either for Congress or for the \\n\\n6   presidency?  And in this situation, the Colorado \\n\\n7 Supreme Court is going slightly beyond what Section 3 \\n\\n8   requires because Section 3 on its face bans an \\n\\n9   insurrectionist only from holding office. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I stop you \\n\\n11 a moment and -- and back up a minute? You admitted \\n\\n12 that the concept of self-executing does generally \\n\\n13   permit states to provide a cause of action for \\n\\n14   breaches of a constitutional provision. \\n\\n15 MR. MITCHELL:  Correct. \\n\\n16            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In fact, they do it \\n\\n17   frequently for takings clauses. Here\\'s -- there\\'s no \\n\\n18 debate that Colorado has placed that -- provided that \\n\\n19 cause of action. You want to go a step further and \\n\\n20 say that this, like the Treaty Clause, requires \\n\\n21   implementing legislation to permit the state to \\n\\n22   disqualify an insurrectionist --\\n\\n23 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s correct.  So --\\n\\n24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- under Section 3. \\n\\n25 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s right. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                   \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n10 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So history proves a lot \\n\\n2 to me --\\n\\n3 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and to my colleagues \\n\\n5   generally.  There\\'s a whole lot of examples of states \\n\\n6 relying on Section 3 to disqualify insurrectionists \\n\\n7 for state offices, and you\\'re basically telling us \\n\\n8 that you want us to go two steps further. You want \\n\\n9 to -- maybe three. \\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You want us to say that \\n\\n12   self-execution doesn\\'t mean what it generally means. \\n\\n13 You want us now to say it means that Congress must \\n\\n14   permit states or require states to stop \\n\\n15   insurrectionists from taking state office. \\n\\n16 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and so this is a \\n\\n18   complete preemption in a way that\\'s very rare, isn\\'t \\n\\n19 it? \\n\\n20 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, that\\'s -- the only \\n\\n21 thing I would --\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It\\'s rare under the \\n\\n23   Fourteenth Amendment. \\n\\n24 MR.

We \\n\\n7 were careful in our brief not to rely on that phrase. \\n\\n8 And Griffin\\'s Case doesn\\'t --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right, you are, because \\n\\n10 it\\'s not. \\n\\n11            MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s right. \\n\\n12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. \\n\\n13 MR.

I \\n\\n18   understand you\\'re relying on Griffin.  Let\\'s just be \\n\\n19 very clear. \\n\\n20 MR.

MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- Section 3 as \\n\\n7 executing itself, needing no legislation on the part \\n\\n8 of Congress to give it effect. \\n\\n9 So you\\'re relying on a non-precedential \\n\\n10 case by a justice who later takes back what he said. \\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  But the key point with \\n\\n12   Griffin\\'s Case and why it\\'s an important precedent, \\n\\n13 despite everything Your Honor said, it is not a \\n\\n14   precedent of this Court, but Griffin\\'s Case provided \\n\\n15 the backdrop against which Congress legislated the \\n\\n16 Enforcement Act of 1870 when it first provided an \\n\\n17   enforcement mechanism for Section 3. \\n\\n18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah.  And it did away \\n\\n19 with it later. \\n\\n20 MR. MITCHELL:  It did away with it later. \\n\\n21 But, as --\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but -- but that \\n\\n23 has nothing to say with respect to what Section 3 \\n\\n24    means. \\n\\n25 Can we get to the issue, which is, I think, \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                    \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n13 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 one that I go back to that I started with, and -- and \\n\\n2 very briefly, what sense does it say that states \\n\\n3 can\\'t enforce Section 3 against their own officials? \\n\\n4 MR. MITCHELL:  Because --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I think, logically, \\n\\n6 those are two separate issues in my mind: Can states \\n\\n7 enforce the Insurrection Clause against their own \\n\\n8   officeholders, or can they enforce it against federal \\n\\n9   officials, or can they enforce it against the \\n\\n10   president?  Those are all three different questions \\n\\n11 in my mind. \\n\\n12 MR. MITCHELL:  And the -- the answer to all \\n\\n13 three of those questions turns on whether this Court \\n\\n14 agrees with the holding of Griffin\\'s Case.  If \\n\\n15   Griffin\\'s Case is the proper enunciation of the law, \\n\\n16 then a state cannot do any of the things Your Honor \\n\\n17 suggested unless Congress gives it authority to do so \\n\\n18 through implementing legislation.  So --\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So a non-precedential \\n\\n20   decision that relies on policy, doesn\\'t look at the \\n\\n21 language, doesn\\'t look at the history, doesn\\'t \\n\\n22 analyze anything than the disruption that such a suit \\n\\n23 would bring, you want us to credit as precedential? \\n\\n24 MR. MITCHELL:  Because Congress relied on \\n\\n25 Griffin\\'s Case when it enacted the Enforcement Act of \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n14 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 1870 and established the --\\n\\n2 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Mitchell, if I may \\n\\n3   interrupt --\\n\\n4 MR. MITCHELL:  Please. \\n\\n5 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- but just to clarify, I \\n\\n6 mean, this sounds like your reply brief, where it \\n\\n7 sounds like you\\'re not making a constitutional \\n\\n8 argument, you\\'re really making a statutory preemption \\n\\n9   argument.  And --\\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n11 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is that -- is that what \\n\\n12   you\\'re doing here?  You\\'re not saying that the \\n\\n13   Constitution gives you this rule.  It\\'s the kind of \\n\\n14   combination of Griffin\\'s Case plus the way Congress \\n\\n15 acted after Griffin\\'s Case --\\n\\n16 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n17 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that gives you the rule? \\n\\n18 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s exactly right, \\n\\n19 Justice Kagan, because we have implementing \\n\\n20 legislation, Congress took up the invitation provided \\n\\n21 by Griffin\\'s Case and established writs of quo \\n\\n22   warranto in the 1870 Enforcement Act, later repealed \\n\\n23 them. \\n\\n24 The only enforcement legislation that\\'s \\n\\n25 currently on the books is the insurrection criminal \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                         \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n15 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   statute, Section 2383.  And when Congress made all of \\n\\n2 these decisions -- the initial enactment of the \\n\\n3   Enforcement Act in 1870, the repeal of the quo \\n\\n4   warranto provisions in 1948 -- all of those were made \\n\\n5 with Griffin\\'s Case as the backdrop.  The under --\\n\\n6 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- please. \\n\\n7 MR. MITCHELL: Well, the understanding was \\n\\n8 that these congressionally established remedies would \\n\\n9 be exclusive of state court remedies. So there\\'s not \\n\\n10 an express statement of preemption in these statutes, \\n\\n11 but there didn\\'t need to be because Griffin\\'s Case \\n\\n12   provided the backdrop. \\n\\n13 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I could just \\n\\n14   understand the argument a little bit better, suppose \\n\\n15 that we took all of that away.  You know, suppose \\n\\n16 there were no Griffin\\'s Case and there were no \\n\\n17   subsequent congressional enactment.  What do you then \\n\\n18 think the rule would be? \\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  So in just as a matter of \\n\\n20 first principles without Griffin\\'s Case, it\\'s a much \\n\\n21   harder argument for us to make because, normally, I \\n\\n22 mean, every other provision of the Fourteenth \\n\\n23 Amendment has been treated as self-executing. \\n\\n24 What we would argue in this hypothetical \\n\\n25 that Your Honor has suggested is that there are \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n16 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   practical considerations unique to Section 3 that \\n\\n2 counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief \\n\\n3 Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin\\'s Case and it \\n\\n4 goes to I think the policy concerns he talks about, \\n\\n5 where this was a case -- Griffin\\'s Case involved a \\n\\n6 convicted criminal who was seeking a writ of habeas \\n\\n7 corpus on the ground that the judge who tried his \\n\\n8 case was an insurrectionist disqualified under \\n\\n9 Section 3, and Chief Justice Chase realizes that if \\n\\n10 he enforces Section 3 in this situation, it would \\n\\n11 nullify every official act taken not only by this \\n\\n12   particular judge but by anyone who is an \\n\\n13 insurrectionist or arguably an insurrectionist under \\n\\n14 Section 3, and that was --\\n\\n15 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, why do you need \\n\\n16 those consequential concerns, though?  I mean, it \\n\\n17 kind of seems to me that what Justice Kagan is \\n\\n18 getting at is why don\\'t you have an argument that the \\n\\n19 Constitution of its own force, that Section 3 of its \\n\\n20 own force, preempts the states\\' ability not -- not \\n\\n21   necessarily, I think, not to enforce Section 3 \\n\\n22 against its own officers but against federal \\n\\n23   officers, like in a Tarble\\'s Case kind of way. \\n\\n24 MR. MITCHELL:  So there could also be an \\n\\n25   argument that\\'s more limited.  You\\'re suggesting \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n17 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 there may be a barrier under the Constitution to a \\n\\n2 state legislating an enforcement mechanism for \\n\\n3 Section 3 specific to federal officers. \\n\\n4 We could rely on precedents such as McClung \\n\\n5 that says that state courts lack the authority to \\n\\n6 issue mandamus relief against federal officials and \\n\\n7 extend that principle here. \\n\\n8 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, why aren\\'t you \\n\\n9   making those arguments? \\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  Because that doesn\\'t get us \\n\\n11 -- that -- Griffin\\'s Case --\\n\\n12 JUSTICE BARRETT:  That only gets you out of \\n\\n13 state court, it doesn\\'t get you out of federal court? \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  And also the holding \\n\\n15 of Griffin\\'s Case went well beyond that because Chief \\n\\n16 Justice Chase said in this opinion, which, again, \\n\\n17 provided the backdrop for the congressional \\n\\n18   enforcement legislation, that states had no role in \\n\\n19 enforcing Section 3 unless Congress was to give them \\n\\n20    that authority through a statute that they passed \\n\\n21   pursuant to their -- powers. \\n\\n22 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I --\\n\\n23 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But your argument\\'s --\\n\\n24 oh, sorry. \\n\\n25 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  No, please go ahead. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n                    \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n                       \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n18 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I was just going to add \\n\\n2 one last thing. I think your argument\\'s a little \\n\\n3 broader than that because I think, if we accept your \\n\\n4 position that disqualifying someone from the ballot \\n\\n5 is adding a qualification, really, your position is \\n\\n6 that Congress can\\'t enact a statute that would allow \\n\\n7   Colorado to do what it\\'s done either because then \\n\\n8   Congress would be adding a qualification, which it \\n\\n9 can\\'t do either. \\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I don\\'t agree with that, \\n\\n11 Justice Barrett.  Congress is not bound by the \\n\\n12 holding of Term Limits.  Term Limits only prohibits \\n\\n13 the states from adding additional qualifications or \\n\\n14   altering the Constitution\\'s qualifications for \\n\\n15 federal office.  It does not purport to restrain \\n\\n16   Congress. \\n\\n17 So, if Congress were to enact implementing \\n\\n18   legislation that authorized the states to exclude \\n\\n19 insurrectionists from the ballot, we believe that \\n\\n20 would be valid enforcement legislation under Section \\n\\n21 3 with an important caveat.  There has to be \\n\\n22   congruence and proportionality under this Court\\'s \\n\\n23   precedents.  So Congress --\\n\\n24 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why would that be an \\n\\n25   important -- why would that be permissible? Because \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                   \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                        \\n  \\n\\n19 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Section 3 refers to the holding of office, not \\n\\n2 running for office.  And so --\\n\\n3 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n4 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- if a state or Congress \\n\\n5 were to go further and say that you can\\'t run for the \\n\\n6 office, you can\\'t compete in a primary, wouldn\\'t that \\n\\n7 be adding an additional qualification for serving for \\n\\n8   president?  You must have been free from this --\\n\\n9   disqualification at an earlier point in time than \\n\\n10 Section 3 specifies. \\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  I think the answer to your \\n\\n12 question, Justice Alito, depends on how you interpret \\n\\n13 the word \"enforce\" in Section 5. And some members of \\n\\n14 this Court, such as Justice Scalia, thought that \\n\\n15 \"enforce\" means you can do nothing more than enact \\n\\n16   legislation that mirrors the Fourteenth Amendment\\'s \\n\\n17   self-executing requirements and you can\\'t go an inch \\n\\n18   beyond that.  That\\'s not the current jurisprudence of \\n\\n19 this Court --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  Well, all right.  We \\n\\n21 have --\\n\\n22 MR. MITCHELL:  -- the Court allows --\\n\\n23 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- to decide whether it\\'s \\n\\n24   congruent and proportional. \\n\\n25 MR.

I --\\n\\n5 I take you to -- to argue -- and I think this is \\n\\n6 right -- that the term \"self-executing\" is a misnomer \\n\\n7 as applied here. \\n\\n8 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, it is. \\n\\n9 JUSTICE ALITO:  Very often, when we use the \\n\\n10 term, what we\\'re referring to is the proposition that \\n\\n11 a particular provision of the Constitution or a \\n\\n12 statute in and of itself creates a private right of \\n\\n13 action. That\\'s not what the issue is here. \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  No, that\\'s not the issue \\n\\n15 here. And sometimes the phrase \"self-executing\" is \\n\\n16 used that way. The only thing I would add is \\n\\n17   sometimes it\\'s used in a different sense.  With \\n\\n18   self-executing treaties or non-self-executing \\n\\n19 treaties, the issue is whether that treaty has any \\n\\n20 force as domestic law whatsoever. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. Right. Well, I \\n\\n22 don\\'t see what is gained by using this term which is \\n\\n23 used in different contexts rather than directly \\n\\n24   addressing what\\'s involved here, which is the \\n\\n25 question of who can enforce Section 3 with respect to \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n21 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 a presidential candidate. \\n\\n2 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO:  The consequences of what \\n\\n4 the Colorado Supreme Court did, some people claim, \\n\\n5 would be quite severe.  Would it not permit -- would \\n\\n6 it not lead to the possibility that other states \\n\\n7 would say, using their choice-of-law rules and their \\n\\n8 rules on -- on collateral estoppel, that there\\'s \\n\\n9   non-mutual collateral estoppel against former \\n\\n10 President Trump and so the decision of the Colorado \\n\\n11 Supreme Court could effectively decide this question \\n\\n12 for many other states, perhaps all other states? \\n\\n13 Could it not lead to that consequence? \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  I don\\'t think so because \\n\\n15   Colorado law does not recognize non-mutual collateral \\n\\n16   estoppel.  And I believe the preclusive effect of the \\n\\n17   decision would be determined by Colorado law rather \\n\\n18 than the law of another state. \\n\\n19 But I think your question, Justice Alito, \\n\\n20 gives rise to an -- an even greater concern because, \\n\\n21 if this decision does not have preclusive effect in \\n\\n22 other lawsuits, it opens the possibility that a \\n\\n23 different factual record could be developed in some \\n\\n24 of the litigation that occurs in other states, and \\n\\n25 different factual findings could be entered by state \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n22 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 trial court judges.  They might conclude as a matter \\n\\n2 of fact that President Trump did not have any intent \\n\\n3 to engage in incitement or make some other finding \\n\\n4 that differs from what this trial court judge found. \\n\\n5 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, exactly.  So this --\\n\\n6 in this decision, the -- the trial court in Colorado \\n\\n7 thought that it was proper to admit the January 6th \\n\\n8 report, and it also admitted the testimony of an \\n\\n9 expert --\\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n11 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- who testified about the \\n\\n12 meaning of certain words and phrases to people who \\n\\n13   communicate with and among extremists, right? \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n15 JUSTICE ALITO:  Another -- another state \\n\\n16 court could reach an opposite conclusion on both of \\n\\n17 those questions. \\n\\n18 MR. MITCHELL:  Certainly.  Other states \\n\\n19 could conclude that the January 6th report is \\n\\n20   inadmissible hearsay.  They might also conclude that \\n\\n21   statements within the January 6th report were hearsay \\n\\n22 even if the report itself is not.  And they could \\n\\n23 certainly reach a different conclusion with respect \\n\\n24 to the expert testimony of Professor Simi.

MITCHELL: I think they all mutually \\n\\n9   reinforce each other.  We have an argument, we \\n\\n10 believe, that is sufficient to dispose of this case \\n\\n11 just based on the meaning of \"officer of the United \\n\\n12 States,\" as well as the argument we\\'re making based \\n\\n13 on Term Limits, but all of the consequentialist \\n\\n14   considerations that Your Honor has suggested are \\n\\n15   additional reasons to reverse the Colorado Supreme \\n\\n16   Court, although we don\\'t think it\\'s necessary to get \\n\\n17 into consequences because the law is clearly on our \\n\\n18 side. \\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I -- you keep \\n\\n20   saying \"term limits.\"  There are other presidential \\n\\n21   qualifications in the Constitution, age. \\n\\n22 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Citizenship.

MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is -- are your \\n\\n8   arguments limited to Section 3? \\n\\n9 MR. MITCHELL:  Not quite.  The question, \\n\\n10 Justice Sotomayor, is whether the state is violating \\n\\n11 Term Limits by adding to or altering the extant \\n\\n12   qualifications for the presidency in the \\n\\n13   Constitution.  Now the hypo --\\n\\n14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you want us to say \\n\\n15 -- I -- I -- I\\'m wondering why the term limits \\n\\n16   qualification is important to you. \\n\\n17 MR. MITCHELL:  Because it --\\n\\n18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are -- are you setting \\n\\n19 up so that if some president runs for a third term, \\n\\n20 that a state can\\'t disqualify him from the ballot? \\n\\n21 MR. MITCHELL:  Of course, a state can \\n\\n22   disqualify him from the ballot because that is a \\n\\n23   qualification that is categorical.  It\\'s not \\n\\n24   defeasible by Congress.  So a state is enforcing the \\n\\n25   Constitution when it says you can\\'t appear on our \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 ballot if you\\'ve already served two terms as \\n\\n2   president. \\n\\n3 The same goes --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The same if they\\'re \\n\\n5 under age when elected and the same if they\\'re not a \\n\\n6 U.S. citizen. \\n\\n7 MR. MITCHELL:  The same if they\\'re not --\\n\\n8 well, the same if they\\'re not a U.S. citizen for \\n\\n9 sure. The age is a little more nuanced because you \\n\\n10 can imagine a scenario where the person is 34 years \\n\\n11 old at the time of the election, but he turns 35 \\n\\n12   before Inauguration Day. \\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then that would \\n\\n14 come up --\\n\\n15 MR.

MITCHELL:  But --\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The state would make a \\n\\n20 decision and say he\\'s ineligible, and we would have \\n\\n21 to decide that question then. \\n\\n22 But my point is so what -- adding \\n\\n23   qualifications to what term limit --\\n\\n24 MR.

With respect to the \\n\\n5 -- maybe I\\'ll start with the age example. \\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n7 MR. MITCHELL:  If a state like Colorado \\n\\n8 says you can\\'t appear on our presidential ballot \\n\\n9 unless you are 35 years old on the day of the \\n\\n10   election, that would be a violation of Term Limits \\n\\n11 because there could be a 34-year-old on the day of \\n\\n12 the election who turns 35 before Inauguration Day. \\n\\n13 What Colorado has done here, what their \\n\\n14 Supreme Court has done, is similar because, under \\n\\n15 Section 3, President Trump needs to qualify during \\n\\n16 the time that he would hold office, and the Colorado \\n\\n17 Supreme Court is saying to President Trump:  You have \\n\\n18 to show that you would qualify under Section 3 now, \\n\\n19 at the time of the election, or at the time that we, \\n\\n20 the state supreme court --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now I understand. \\n\\n22 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what -- what --\\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now just -- just a \\n\\n24 point of clarification so we\\'re all on the same page. \\n\\n25 When you say \"Term Limits,\" you mean our decision in \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                       \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n27 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 the Term Limits case --\\n\\n2 MR.

So, on -- on -- on this theory, what is \\n\\n11 the sum total of ways that the -- that Section 3 can \\n\\n12 be enforced, that -- that -- that -- that -- that \\n\\n13 some --\\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah. \\n\\n15 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that somebody out there \\n\\n16 can say, yes, there has been a former president who \\n\\n17 engaged or led or participated in an insurrection and \\n\\n18 so should be disqualified from office, putting aside \\n\\n19 the officer argument --\\n\\n20            MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- what is the sum total of \\n\\n22 ways that that enforcement can happen? \\n\\n23 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  So the answer to \\n\\n24 that question is going to depend on what Your Honor \\n\\n25 thinks of Griffin\\'s Case.  So, if this Court were to \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n31 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   affirm the rationale of Griffin\\'s Case, then the only \\n\\n2 way Section 3 could be enforced is through \\n\\n3   congressional legislation that creates a remedy. So \\n\\n4   Congress could reinstate the quo warranto provisions \\n\\n5 that they initially had in the 1870 --\\n\\n6 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that your position? \\n\\n7 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes, because we believe \\n\\n8   Griffin\\'s Case is correctly decided and should be \\n\\n9   followed --\\n\\n10 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and how does that \\n\\n11 fit with -- a lot of the -- the -- the answers to the \\n\\n12   questions that we\\'ve been giving, you said, well, \\n\\n13   Congress has to have the ability by a two-thirds vote \\n\\n14 to lift the disqualification. \\n\\n15 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n16 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But so too I would -- I \\n\\n17    would think that that provision would -- would --\\n\\n18 would be in some tension with what you just said --\\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  There -- there is some, \\n\\n20 yeah. \\n\\n21            JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- because, if -- if \\n\\n22 Congress has the ability to lift the vote by a \\n\\n23   two-thirds majority, then, surely, it can\\'t be right \\n\\n24 that one House of Congress can do the exact same \\n\\n25 thing by a simple majority. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                          \\n  \\n\\n32 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah, there certainly is \\n\\n2 some tension, Justice Kagan, and some commentators \\n\\n3 have pointed this out.  Professor Baude and Professor \\n\\n4 Paulsen criticized Griffin\\'s Case very sharply. \\n\\n5 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then I must be right. \\n\\n6            (Laughter.) \\n\\n7 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, we don\\'t think it\\'s --\\n\\n8 we don\\'t think this problem is fatal because, to us, \\n\\n9 the -- the two-thirds provision that allows Congress \\n\\n10 to lift a disability is something akin to a pardon \\n\\n11   power, where Congress, through enforcement \\n\\n12   legislation, creates a mechanism by which the \\n\\n13   insurrectionist issue is to be determined by some \\n\\n14 entity, it could be the legislature in the case of an \\n\\n15 elected member of Congress, each House has the \\n\\n16 ability to judge the qualifications of their members, \\n\\n17 or if it\\'s outside the situation of Congress, it \\n\\n18 would be whatever Congress enacts. \\n\\n19 So, when it was the writs of quo warranto, \\n\\n20 each federal prosecutor had the authority to bring a \\n\\n21 quo warranto writ against an incumbent official and \\n\\n22 seek his ouster from office under Section 3, but it \\n\\n23 was still subject to that amnesty provision in \\n\\n24 Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. \\n\\n25 So we do acknowledge the tension, but we \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n33 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 don\\'t think that\\'s an insurmountable obstacle to our \\n\\n2 view of the case. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I don\\'t even see why \\n\\n4 there\\'s -- why there\\'s a tension.  If you analogize \\n\\n5 the -- the lifting by Congress of the \\n\\n6   disqualification by a two-thirds vote to a pardon, \\n\\n7 then, surely, one would not argue that the fact that \\n\\n8 the president or a governor can pardon someone from a \\n\\n9   criminal conviction or a criminal offense means that \\n\\n10   the person couldn\\'t be prosecuted in the first place \\n\\n11 for the criminal offense. \\n\\n12 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s right. \\n\\n13 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right? \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n15 JUSTICE ALITO:  So I don\\'t see what the \\n\\n16 tension is. They\\'re two separate things.  Did the \\n\\n17 person engage in this activity which is prohibited, \\n\\n18 and second, even if the person did engage in the \\n\\n19   activity, are there reasons why the disqualification \\n\\n20 or the -- should be lifted or the pardon should be \\n\\n21   granted. \\n\\n22 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s right.  I mean, if --\\n\\n23 again, if the Court accepts the holding of Griffin\\'s \\n\\n24 Case, that\\'s exactly the regime that we would have, \\n\\n25 like the Court described. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                        \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n34 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  I don\\'t see there\\'s \\n\\n2 a tension. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess I don\\'t --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE ALITO:  But, also, there\\'s a limit \\n\\n5 on what one can infer from the mere fact that \\n\\n6   Congress can lift the disqualification.  You can\\'t \\n\\n7 infer from that that it is impermissible to have a \\n\\n8 prior determination that the person did engage in the \\n\\n9   insurrection.  You can\\'t make that inference. \\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  Okay. \\n\\n11 JUSTICE ALITO: It\\'s not logical. \\n\\n12 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but I think --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yet isn\\'t that what \\n\\n14   you\\'re doing? \\n\\n15 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- what\\'s -- what\\'s --\\n\\n16 what\\'s -- what\\'s -- what\\'s in tension is that you \\n\\n17 would have the exact same actor and say, look, that \\n\\n18 actor can lift --\\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n20 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the disqualification by \\n\\n21 a two-thirds vote. \\n\\n22 But you\\'re saying only that actor can put \\n\\n23 the disqualification into effect in the first place \\n\\n24 and it can do that by far less than two-thirds.  It \\n\\n25 can do that just by a simple majority of one House. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n35 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR.

MITCHELL:  -- congressional inaction \\n\\n6 would --\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that means that there \\n\\n8 will --\\n\\n9 MR. MITCHELL:  -- effectively act as a --\\n\\n10 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The only thing it takes --\\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah. \\n\\n12 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to have no action --\\n\\n13 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n14 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is -- you know, is, you \\n\\n15 know, half plus one saying we don\\'t feel like it. \\n\\n16 MR. MITCHELL:  But that\\'s why we tried to \\n\\n17   characterize our Griffin\\'s Case argument the way we \\n\\n18 did where we rely on preemption doctrines as well. \\n\\n19 So we have --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, don\\'t -- don\\'t \\n\\n21 you think --\\n\\n22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don\\'t we --\\n\\n23 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- Griffin\\'s Case is \\n\\n24 also relevant to trying to figure out what the \\n\\n25   original public meaning of Section 3 of the \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n36 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   Fourteenth Amendment is?

MITCHELL:  I do think it\\'s probative, \\n\\n9 Justice Kavanaugh. We didn\\'t rely too heavily on the \\n\\n10 point that you\\'re making, partly because we have this \\n\\n11 other opinion from Justice Chase in the Jefferson \\n\\n12 Davis case.  So that argument could potentially \\n\\n13   boomerang on us, which is why we didn\\'t push it very \\n\\n14 hard in our briefing. \\n\\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. \\n\\n16 MR.

MITCHELL:  Just it is -- it is relevant \\n\\n21 and probative for sure, but I think there is other \\n\\n22   evidence too that might perhaps undercut the \\n\\n23   usefulness of trying to characterize Griffin\\'s Case \\n\\n24 as completely emblematic of the original \\n\\n25   understanding. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n37 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then why don\\'t we \\n\\n2 move on to the officer point. \\n\\n3 MR.

So I had a question \\n\\n7 about it because you\\'re making a textualist argument. \\n\\n8 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n9 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And as I look at Section \\n\\n10 3, I see two parts of the first sentence of Section \\n\\n11 3. \\n\\n12 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n13 JUSTICE JACKSON:  The first is a list of \\n\\n14 offices that a disqualified person is barred from \\n\\n15   holding, and the second are specific circumstances \\n\\n16 that give rise to disqualification. \\n\\n17 So, first, am I right about seeing that \\n\\n18 there are two different things happening in the first \\n\\n19   sentence? \\n\\n20 MR.

But we did point out in our \\n\\n15 opening brief that there are potential issues if this \\n\\n16 Court were to rule on \"office under\" because that \\n\\n17   phrase appears in other parts of the Constitution, \\n\\n18   including the Emoluments Clause, the Impeachment \\n\\n19   Disqualification Clause, and the Incompatibility \\n\\n20 Clause --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Would we necessarily have \\n\\n22 to say -- I mean, I thought -- I thought the point \\n\\n23 was that Section 3 was unique, that there was \\n\\n24   something happening with Section 3 that could explain \\n\\n25 why certain offices were left off or whatnot. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n42 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR.

MITCHELL:  Because it\\'s clear from the \\n\\n4   constitutional text that there are officers that do \\n\\n5 not hold offices under the United States, for \\n\\n6   example, the Speaker of the House and the President \\n\\n7 Pro Tempore.  They\\'re described as officers in \\n\\n8 Article I who are chosen by the legislature. \\n\\n9 They also have to be officers if they\\'re \\n\\n10 able to be covered by the Presidential Succession Act \\n\\n11   because, under the Constitution, only officers can \\n\\n12 serve when there\\'s a vacancy in both the presidency \\n\\n13 and the vice presidency. \\n\\n14 So they\\'re officers, but they\\'re not \\n\\n15 offices under the United States because of the \\n\\n16 Incompatibility Clause, which says that if you\\'re a \\n\\n17 member of Congress, you cannot simultaneously hold an \\n\\n18   office under the United States. So that provision of \\n\\n19 the Constitution clearly demonstrates that --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I --\\n\\n21 MR. MITCHELL:  -- members of Congress can\\'t \\n\\n22 hold offices. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- I -- I appreciate that \\n\\n24 --\\n\\n25 MR.

Is -- is \\n\\n2 there anything in the original drafting, history, \\n\\n3   discussion that you think illuminates why that \\n\\n4   distinction would carry such profound weight? \\n\\n5 MR.

MITCHELL:  But we aren\\'t relying \\n\\n13 necessarily on the thought processes of the people \\n\\n14 who drafted these provisions because they\\'re \\n\\n15   unknowable.  But, even if they were knowable, we\\'re \\n\\n16 not sure they would be relevant in any event because \\n\\n17 this language, especially in Section 3, was enacted \\n\\n18 as a compromise. \\n\\n19 There were certainly radical Republicans \\n\\n20 who wanted to go much further.  If you look at some \\n\\n21 of the earlier drafts that were proposed, some people \\n\\n22 wanted to ban all insurrectionists from holding \\n\\n23   office regardless of whether they previously swore an \\n\\n24 oath.

Thank \\n\\n2 you, counsel. \\n\\n3 I just have one very technical question. \\n\\n4 The statute in 1870, if -- if it were still in \\n\\n5 effect, would require you to modify your arguments \\n\\n6   slightly.  It was repealed, as you say, in 1948. \\n\\n7 Do -- I -- I tried to find it, but I \\n\\n8   couldn\\'t.  Do you know why it was repealed? \\n\\n9 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I -- we don\\'t know why. \\n\\n10 It looks like it was done as part of a reorganization \\n\\n11 of the U.S. Code, so it doesn\\'t appear there was any \\n\\n12   policy motivation behind that decision.  I think a \\n\\n13 lot of things got repealed during this 1948 --\\n\\n14   decisions that were made. \\n\\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. \\n\\n16 Justice Thomas, anything further? \\n\\n17 Justice Alito? \\n\\n18 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there any history of \\n\\n19   states using Section 3 as a way to bar federal \\n\\n20   officeholders? \\n\\n21 MR.

I mean, Griffin\\'s \\n\\n23 Case has been the law -- I shouldn\\'t say that it\\'s \\n\\n24 been the law because it was just a circuit court \\n\\n25 decision, but that has been the settled understanding \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n46 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 of Section 3 since 1870 when it was decided. \\n\\n2 JUSTICE ALITO:  Thank you. \\n\\n3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor? \\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I just want to pin \\n\\n5 down your principal argument on Section 3. You argue \\n\\n6 that even though the president may or may not \\n\\n7 qualify -- presidency may or may not qualify as an \\n\\n8   office under the United States, your principal \\n\\n9   argument is that the president is not an officer of \\n\\n10 the United States, correct? \\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah, I would say it a \\n\\n12 little more forcefully than what Your Honor just \\n\\n13   described.  We believe the presidency is excluded \\n\\n14 from \"office under the United States,\" but the \\n\\n15 argument we have that he\\'s excluded, the president, \\n\\n16 as an officer of the United States is the stronger of \\n\\n17 the two textually. \\n\\n18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ah. \\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  It has fewer implications \\n\\n20 for other constitutional provisions --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A bit of a \\n\\n22 gerrymandered rule, isn\\'t it, designed to benefit \\n\\n23 only your client? \\n\\n24 MR.

I know some scholars have been \\n\\n4 discussing it. But just so we\\'re clear, under that \\n\\n5   reading, only -- only the Petitioner is disqualified \\n\\n6 because virtually every other president except \\n\\n7   Washington --\\n\\n8 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- has taken an oath of \\n\\n10 -- to support the Constitution, correct? \\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s right.  Every \\n\\n12   president -- to our knowledge, every other president \\n\\n13 -- John Adams might also be excluded because he took \\n\\n14 the oath as a vice president, which is not an officer \\n\\n15 -- but, yes, President Biden would certainly be \\n\\n16   covered.  He took the oath as a member of Congress. \\n\\n17 And that\\'s true of every previous president. \\n\\n18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would that be true if \\n\\n19 we were to hold more narrowly in a reversal that it\\'s \\n\\n20 not Section 3 that\\'s at issue but Thornton and others \\n\\n21 as to whether Section 3 can be enforced by states \\n\\n22 against the president? \\n\\n23 MR.

Thank you. \\n\\n6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? \\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if I could just \\n\\n8 understand, I mean, given that you say you don\\'t have \\n\\n9 a lot of evidence that the founding -- or the \\n\\n10 generation that we\\'re looking at is really thinking \\n\\n11 about \"office\" versus \"officer of the United States,\" \\n\\n12 I mean, it -- it -- it would suggest that we should \\n\\n13 ask what -- is that rule a sensible one?  You know, \\n\\n14 if they had thought about it, what reason would they \\n\\n15 have given for that rule? \\n\\n16 And it does seem as though there -- there\\'s \\n\\n17 no particular reason, and you can think of lots of \\n\\n18 reasons for the contrary --\\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n20 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to say that the only \\n\\n21 people who have engaged in insurrection who are not \\n\\n22   disqualified from office are presidents who have not \\n\\n23 held high office before.  Why would that rule exist? \\n\\n24 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah.  I don\\'t think there \\n\\n25 is a good rationale given that this was compromise \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n49 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   legislation.  And sometimes this happens with \\n\\n2   statutory compromises and even constitutional \\n\\n3   compromises.  There\\'s an agreed-upon set of words \\n\\n4 that can pass both Houses of Congress, but different \\n\\n5   legislators may have had goals and motivations.  They \\n\\n6 didn\\'t all get their way. In a compromise, everyone \\n\\n7 goes away miserable. \\n\\n8 But this was the text that was settled \\n\\n9 upon. And it does seem odd that President Trump \\n\\n10 would fall through the cracks in a sense, but if \\n\\n11 \"officer of the United States\" means appointed \\n\\n12   officials, there\\'s just no way he can be covered \\n\\n13 under Section 3.  The Court would have to reject our \\n\\n14 officer argument to get to that point. \\n\\n15 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is there any better \\n\\n16 reason, if he -- go to the office argument that \\n\\n17 Justice Jackson was suggesting, is there any better \\n\\n18   reason for saying that an insurrectionist cannot hold \\n\\n19 the whole panoply of offices in the United States, \\n\\n20 but we\\'re perfectly fine with that insurrectionist \\n\\n21 being president? \\n\\n22 MR. MITCHELL:  I think that\\'s an even \\n\\n23 tougher argument for us to make as a policy matter \\n\\n24 because one would think, of all offices, the \\n\\n25 presidency would be the one you\\'d want to keep out \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                        \\n  \\n\\n50 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 the Confederate insurrectionists.  That\\'s the \\n\\n2   commander-in-chief of the Army. So, again, that\\'s \\n\\n3 why we\\'re leaning more on the \"officer of\" argument \\n\\n4 than the \"office under.\" \\n\\n5 We\\'re not conceding \"office under,\" but we \\n\\n6   definitely have the stronger textual case and \\n\\n7   structural case on \"officer of the United States.\" \\n\\n8 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you. \\n\\n9 MR. MITCHELL:  Thanks. \\n\\n10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Gorsuch? \\n\\n11 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Do you want to respond to \\n\\n12 some of the specific textual arguments on the \\n\\n13   \"officer of\" with respect to the Appointments Clause, \\n\\n14 the Impeachment Clause, and some of the others? \\n\\n15 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah.  So the way -- let\\'s \\n\\n16 start with --\\n\\n17 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But why --\\n\\n18 MR. MITCHELL:  Well, I\\'ll start with the \\n\\n19   Commissions Clause. \\n\\n20 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The ball has been \\n\\n21   bouncing --\\n\\n22 MR. MITCHELL:  Yeah. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- on that back and \\n\\n24 forth, and I wanted to see where you landed today. \\n\\n25 MR. MITCHELL: There are three textual \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n51 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   inferences that could be drawn from each of those \\n\\n2   provisions Your Honor just mentioned, but the \\n\\n3   Commissions Clause, I think, is the strongest because \\n\\n4 it says the president shall, you know, \"commission \\n\\n5 all the Officers of the United States.\"  \"Shall\" is \\n\\n6   mandatory.  \"All\" is all-encompassing.  And the \\n\\n7   president doesn\\'t commission himself, and he can\\'t \\n\\n8   commission himself.  So that\\'s one of the first \\n\\n9   problems. \\n\\n10 I think the Anderson litigants are trying \\n\\n11 to say, you know, there\\'s somehow an implied \\n\\n12   exception there because the president obviously can\\'t \\n\\n13   commission himself, so we should construe that to \\n\\n14 mean all officers of the United States besides the \\n\\n15   president.  But you also have members of Congress who \\n\\n16 are not commissioned by the president, and that\\'s \\n\\n17 because they\\'re not officers of the United States. \\n\\n18 So the only sensible distinction that we \\n\\n19 can see, given the language of the Commissions \\n\\n20 Clause, is that officers of -- of the United States \\n\\n21 are appointed officials, and elected officials, such \\n\\n22 as members of Congress and the president and the vice \\n\\n23   president, are not. \\n\\n24 And the Impeachment Clause reinforces that. \\n\\n25 \"The President, [the] Vice President and all civil \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n52 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Officers of the United States shall be removed from \\n\\n2   Office [upon] Impeachment for, and Conviction of ... \\n\\n3 [all] high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"  The president \\n\\n4 and the vice president are listed separately from \\n\\n5   officers of the United States. \\n\\n6 And then, of course, the Appointments \\n\\n7 Clause, we know the president is not appointed \\n\\n8   pursuant to Article II.  Neither is the vice \\n\\n9   president.  Neither are members of Congress.  So they \\n\\n10 can\\'t be officers either. \\n\\n11 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And how does Article I, \\n\\n12 Section 6, fit into this discussion? \\n\\n13 MR. MITCHELL:  And this is about officers \\n\\n14 being in the line of succession? \\n\\n15 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yes, exactly. \\n\\n16 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  So you have to be an \\n\\n17 officer to be in the line of succession.  We have a \\n\\n18 federal statute that puts the Speaker and the \\n\\n19   President Pro Tempore in the line of succession. \\n\\n20 They are officers.  But they\\'re not officers of the \\n\\n21   United States because they\\'re not subject to \\n\\n22   impeachment, they\\'re not commissioned by the \\n\\n23   president, and they\\'re not appointed pursuant to \\n\\n24 Article II. \\n\\n25 So there is this gap between the term \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n53 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   \"officer\" and the phrase \"officers of the United \\n\\n2   States,\" reinforcing the idea that \"officers of the \\n\\n3   United States\" is a term of art that doesn\\'t refer \\n\\n4 just to federal officeholders, which is what the \\n\\n5 Anderson litigants are claiming, but refers only to \\n\\n6 those who are appointed, not to those who are \\n\\n7   elected. \\n\\n8 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you. \\n\\n9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kavanaugh? \\n\\n10            JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Can I just make sure I \\n\\n11   understand how you\\'re using Griffin\\'s Case again? \\n\\n12 Section 3 refers to insurrection and raises questions \\n\\n13 about who decides what processes are to be used. \\n\\n14   That\\'s ratified in 1868.  The next year, Chief \\n\\n15 Justice Chase opines that states do not have the \\n\\n16   authority, that only Congress has the authority to \\n\\n17 enforce that.  That could be evidence, as you say, of \\n\\n18 the original public meaning, at least some evidence. \\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n20 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  It\\'s a precedent, \\n\\n21   although not binding.  But your point then is it\\'s \\n\\n22   reinforced because Congress itself relies on that \\n\\n23 precedent in the Enforcement Act of 1870 and forms \\n\\n24 the backdrop against which Congress does legislate. \\n\\n25 And then, as Justice Alito says, the historical \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n54 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 practice for 155 years has been that that\\'s the way \\n\\n2 it\\'s gone.  There hasn\\'t -- there haven\\'t been state \\n\\n3 attempts to enforce disqualification under Section 3 \\n\\n4 against federal officers in the years since. \\n\\n5 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n6 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  So whether that\\'s a \\n\\n7   Federalist 37 liquidation argument, it all reinforces \\n\\n8 what happened back in 1868, 1869, and 1870. \\n\\n9 MR. MITCHELL:  Right. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Do you want to add to \\n\\n11 that, alter that? \\n\\n12 MR. MITCHELL:  No, I think that\\'s exactly \\n\\n13 right. And the last part you mentioned, Your Honor, \\n\\n14 is crucial to our argument, that Congress relied on \\n\\n15   Griffin\\'s Case.  It provided the backdrop against \\n\\n16 which they legislated, which is why we should read \\n\\n17 these extant enforcement mechanisms -- and, right \\n\\n18 now, the only one left is the federal insurrection \\n\\n19   statute, 2383 -- as exclusive of state court \\n\\n20   remedies.  It\\'s an -- it\\'s a form of implied \\n\\n21   preemption, almost Sea Clammers implicit preemption \\n\\n22 of other remedies, because Congress made these \\n\\n23 decisions in explicit reliance on Griffin\\'s Case. \\n\\n24 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And if we agree with \\n\\n25 you on Griffin\\'s Case and what you\\'ve elaborated on \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                         \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n55 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   there, that\\'s the end of the case, right? \\n\\n2 MR. MITCHELL: It should be, yes, unless \\n\\n3 Congress decides to enact a statute, which we can\\'t \\n\\n4 --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  A new --\\n\\n6 MR. MITCHELL:  -- rule out the possibility. \\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- a new statute in \\n\\n8   addition to 2383.  And just to be clear, under 2383, \\n\\n9 you agree that someone could be prosecuted for \\n\\n10 insurrection by federal prosecutors and, if \\n\\n11   convicted, could be or shall be disqualified then \\n\\n12 from office? \\n\\n13 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. But the only caveat \\n\\n14 that I would add is that our client is arguing that \\n\\n15 he has presidential immunity.  So we would not \\n\\n16 concede that he can be prosecuted for what he did on \\n\\n17 January 6th under 2383. \\n\\n18 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Understood.  Asking if \\n\\n19 --\\n\\n20 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- the question about \\n\\n22 the theory of 2383.  Thank you. \\n\\n23 MR. MITCHELL:  Thank you. \\n\\n24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Barrett? \\n\\n25 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So Griffin\\'s Case was a \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n56 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   collateral proceeding, so it\\'s habeas relief. \\n\\n2 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Could Griffin have -- so \\n\\n4 even if Section 3 is not a basis for collateral \\n\\n5 relief in habeas, which was new at the time, could \\n\\n6 Griffin have raised at his trial or in direct appeal \\n\\n7 the argument that Sheffey, Judge Sheffey, you know, \\n\\n8 you can\\'t legitimately sit -- or constitutionally sit \\n\\n9 on my case because you\\'re an insurrectionist and \\n\\n10   you\\'re disqualified?  Could he have won then? \\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  No. \\n\\n12 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Why? \\n\\n13 MR. MITCHELL:  Not if -- not if Griffin\\'s \\n\\n14 Case is correct. So a court would have to reject the \\n\\n15 rationale of Griffin\\'s Case to accept what Your Honor \\n\\n16 was suggesting. \\n\\n17 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, why? Like I said, \\n\\n18   Griffin\\'s Case -- I mean, I think there\\'s some \\n\\n19   language that might be a little bit broad --\\n\\n20 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- but, at bottom, \\n\\n22   Griffin\\'s Case is about a collateral habeas \\n\\n23   proceeding.  And Griffin had brought his case after \\n\\n24 the fact.  He needed a cause of action. \\n\\n25 Why wouldn\\'t it work in a trial for him to \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n57 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   challenge Sheffey\\'s constitutional ability to \\n\\n2   adjudicate his case? \\n\\n3 MR. MITCHELL:  What Griffin\\'s Case holds is \\n\\n4 that only Congress can provide the means of enforcing \\n\\n5 Section 3. And under Your Honor\\'s hypothetical, \\n\\n6   Congress has not enacted any such statute that would \\n\\n7 give Mr. Griffin the right to raise those types of \\n\\n8   arguments at his trial.  So he would have to await \\n\\n9   legislation from Congress. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Let\\'s assume that \\n\\n11 I disagree with you about the officer argument, so \\n\\n12 Section 3 covers President Trump.  Let\\'s say that \\n\\n13 Congress enacts a quo warranto provision that would \\n\\n14 allow a -- a state or I guess it doesn\\'t really \\n\\n15 matter for this purpose, even -- even a federal \\n\\n16   prosecutor, to bring such an action against him to \\n\\n17 remove him from office --\\n\\n18 MR. MITCHELL:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n19 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- in the quo warranto \\n\\n20 way. \\n\\n21 Wouldn\\'t that be in some tension with \\n\\n22   impeachment?  He would be extracted from office \\n\\n23 outside of the process of impeachment.  Couldn\\'t then \\n\\n24 President Trump simply say, well, the only way to get \\n\\n25 me out of office is the impeachment process and not \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n58 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 this quo warranto action? \\n\\n2 MR. MITCHELL:  So I don\\'t know how that \\n\\n3 would play out because the quo warranto actions that \\n\\n4 were brought that I\\'m aware of under the 1870 \\n\\n5   Enforcement Act were brought against state officials. \\n\\n6 And Your Honor\\'s impeachment hypothetical would apply \\n\\n7 not only to the president but any federal --\\n\\n8 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I know. \\n\\n9 MR. MITCHELL:  -- officer of the United \\n\\n10 States. \\n\\n11 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I know. \\n\\n12 MR. MITCHELL:  So I don\\'t know how that \\n\\n13 played out in the courts and whether anyone ever \\n\\n14 tried to argue that impeachment was the exclusive \\n\\n15   remedy for removal --\\n\\n16 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I don\\'t think \\n\\n17 anybody did argue it. I guess what I\\'m asking is, \\n\\n18 you know, you said it\\'s Congress\\'s exclusive \\n\\n19   province. \\n\\n20 MR. MITCHELL:  Yes. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE BARRETT:  And you also said that it \\n\\n22 has to apply, you know, after one is holding office, \\n\\n23 is elected.  And I\\'m asking whether then the \\n\\n24   implication of your argument is that Congress could \\n\\n25 not enact such a provision that applied against \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n59 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 federal officeholders that were covered by Section 3 \\n\\n2 as opposed to state ones? \\n\\n3 MR. MITCHELL:  I believe they could.  The \\n\\n4   Impeachment Clause says that \"the President, [the] \\n\\n5 Vice President and all civil Officers of the United \\n\\n6 States, shall be removed from office [upon] \\n\\n7   Impeachment ... and Conviction.\"  But it doesn\\'t say \\n\\n8 that\\'s the only way you can remove them. \\n\\n9 I mean, Congress can defund a position and \\n\\n10   effectively, it\\'s not the -- quite the same as formal \\n\\n11   removal, but the other relevant precedent is Stuart \\n\\n12 against Laird when the Jeffersonians repealed the \\n\\n13   Midnight Judges Act and abolished all of these \\n\\n14   positions for federal judges.  And some people \\n\\n15 thought that was unconstitutional because they \\n\\n16 thought the only way you could eliminate federal \\n\\n17 judges was through impeachment, but Chief Justice \\n\\n18   Marshall upheld that statute. \\n\\n19 So that to me is a relevant precedent \\n\\n20 showing that impeachment is not the only way to get \\n\\n21 rid of a federal official. \\n\\n22 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  Let me just ask \\n\\n23 one question, and this is just a point of \\n\\n24   clarification. \\n\\n25 Does President Trump have any kind of due \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n60 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 process right here?  I mean, I\\'m -- I\\'m wondering, \\n\\n2 this kind of goes not to the cause of action point or \\n\\n3 the preemption point but more to the question of what \\n\\n4   procedures he might have been entitled to. You don\\'t \\n\\n5 make the argument that he was entitled to any, nor \\n\\n6 did I see the argument that he had any kind of \\n\\n7 constitutionally protected right to ballot access so \\n\\n8 that he was, you know, constitutionally entitled to \\n\\n9 an opportunity to be heard.  Is that right? \\n\\n10 MR. MITCHELL:  We -- we made --\\n\\n11 JUSTICE BARRETT:  He had no due process \\n\\n12 right? \\n\\n13 MR. MITCHELL:  We made that argument below. \\n\\n14 We did not make that in our briefs to this Court for \\n\\n15 several reasons.  I mean, Your Honor\\'s, I think, \\n\\n16   suggesting and this is correct that the proceedings \\n\\n17 below, to put it charitably, were highly irregular. \\n\\n18 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I wasn\\'t suggesting \\n\\n19 that. I was just asking --\\n\\n20 MR. MITCHELL:  I\\'m sorry.  The question --\\n\\n21            JUSTICE BARRETT:  Yeah. \\n\\n22 MR.

Thank you. \\n\\n7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Jackson? \\n\\n8 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Going back to whether the \\n\\n9   presidency is one of the barred offices, I -- I guess \\n\\n10 I\\'m a little surprised at your response to Justice \\n\\n11 Kagan because I thought that the history of the \\n\\n12   Fourteenth Amendment actually provides the reason for \\n\\n13 why the presidency may not be included. \\n\\n14 And by that, I mean I didn\\'t see any \\n\\n15 evidence that the presidency was top of mind for the \\n\\n16 Framers when they were drafting Section 3 because \\n\\n17 they were actually dealing with a different issue. \\n\\n18 The pressing concern, at least as I see the \\n\\n19   historical record, was actually what was going on at \\n\\n20 lower levels of the government, the possible \\n\\n21 infiltration and embedding of insurrectionists into \\n\\n22 the state government apparatus and the real risk that \\n\\n23   former Confederates might return to power in the \\n\\n24 South via state-level elections either in local \\n\\n25 offices or as representatives of the states in \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                    \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n62 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   Congress.  And that\\'s a very different lens. \\n\\n2 Your concern is trying to make sure that \\n\\n3 these people don\\'t come back through the state \\n\\n4   apparatus and control the government in that \\n\\n5   direction seems to me very different than the worry \\n\\n6 that an insurrectionist will seize control of the \\n\\n7   entire national government through the presidency. \\n\\n8 And so I just am surprised that you would \\n\\n9 -- given the text of this -- the -- the provision and \\n\\n10 the historical context that seems to demonstrate that \\n\\n11 their concern or their focus was not about the \\n\\n12 presidency, I just don\\'t understand why you\\'re giving \\n\\n13 that argument up. \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  There -- there is some \\n\\n15 evidence to suggest that, Justice Jackson, but --\\n\\n16 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Is there any evidence to \\n\\n17 suggest that the presidency was what they were \\n\\n18 focused on? \\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  There is some evidence of \\n\\n20   that.  There were people saying we don\\'t want \\n\\n21 Jefferson Davis to be elected president, and there \\n\\n22 was also -- one of the drafts of Section 3 \\n\\n23   specifically mentioned the presidency and the vice \\n\\n24   presidency --\\n\\n25 JUSTICE JACKSON:  But it wasn\\'t the --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                        \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n63 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR.

It wasn\\'t \\n\\n8 the final enactment, but it does show that there was \\n\\n9 some concern by some people about Confederate \\n\\n10 insurrectionists ascending to the presidency. \\n\\n11 And we didn\\'t want to make a law office \\n\\n12 history type argument where we just look at the \\n\\n13   historical evidence and pick the evidence that we \\n\\n14 like and interpret it tendentiously because the other \\n\\n15 side can come back with us and throw this \\n\\n16   countervailing evidence back in our face. \\n\\n17 So we wanted to focus more on the text of \\n\\n18 the Constitution because this was ultimately a \\n\\n19   compromise provision that was enacted in Section 3, \\n\\n20 and --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me ask \\n\\n22 you another question --\\n\\n23 MR.

I mean, I thought you also wanted us \\n\\n4 to end the litigation.  So is there a possibility \\n\\n5 that this case continues in federal court if that\\'s \\n\\n6 our conclusion? \\n\\n7 MR. MITCHELL:  I don\\'t see how it could \\n\\n8   unless Congress were to enact a statute in response \\n\\n9 to this Court\\'s decision. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So your point is that it \\n\\n11 would -- we would have to say congressional enacting \\n\\n12   legislation is necessary for either state or federal \\n\\n13   enforcement? \\n\\n14 MR. MITCHELL:  That\\'s correct. \\n\\n15 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Final \\n\\n16   question.  The Colorado Supreme Court concluded that \\n\\n17 the violent attempts of the Petitioner\\'s supporters \\n\\n18 in this case to halt the count on January 6th \\n\\n19   qualified as an insurrection as defined by Section 3. \\n\\n20 And I read your opening brief to accept \\n\\n21 that those events counted as an insurrection, but \\n\\n22 then your reply seemed to suggest that they were not. \\n\\n23 So what -- what is your position as to \\n\\n24 that? \\n\\n25 MR.

What we said in our opening brief was \\n\\n3 President Trump did not engage in any act that can \\n\\n4 plausibly be characterized as insurrection because he \\n\\n5 did not engage --\\n\\n6 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  So why would \\n\\n7 this not be an -- what is your argument that it\\'s not \\n\\n8 -- your reply brief says that it wasn\\'t because, I \\n\\n9 think, you say, it did not involve an organized \\n\\n10 attempt to overthrow the government.  So --\\n\\n11 MR. MITCHELL:  Right.  That\\'s one of many \\n\\n12   reasons.  But, for an insurrection, there needs to be \\n\\n13 an organized, concerted effort to overthrow the \\n\\n14   government of the United States through violence. \\n\\n15 And this riot that occurred --\\n\\n16 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So your point is that a \\n\\n17 chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an \\n\\n18   insurrection? \\n\\n19 MR. MITCHELL:  No, we didn\\'t concede that \\n\\n20 it\\'s an effort to overthrow the government either, \\n\\n21 Justice Jackson.  Right. None of these criteria were \\n\\n22 met. This was a riot.

MURRAY \\n\\n7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ANDERSON, ET AL. \\n\\n8 MR. MURRAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it \\n\\n9   please the Court: \\n\\n10 We are here because, for the first time \\n\\n11 since the War of 1812, our nation\\'s Capitol came \\n\\n12    under violent assault.  For the first time in \\n\\n13 history, the attack was incited by a sitting \\n\\n14 president of the United States to disrupt the \\n\\n15   peaceful transfer of presidential power. \\n\\n16 By engaging in insurrection against the \\n\\n17   Constitution, President Trump disqualified himself \\n\\n18 from public office.  As we heard earlier, President \\n\\n19 Trump\\'s main argument is that this Court should \\n\\n20 create a special exemption to Section 3 that would \\n\\n21 apply to him and to him alone. He says Section 3 \\n\\n22   disqualifies all oath-breaking insurrectionists, \\n\\n23   except a former president who never before held other \\n\\n24 state or federal office. \\n\\n25 There is no possible rationale for such an \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n67 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   exemption, and the Court should reject the -- the --\\n\\n2 the claim that the Framers made an extraordinary \\n\\n3   mistake.  Section 3 uses deliberately broad language \\n\\n4 to cover all positions of federal power requiring an \\n\\n5 oath to the Constitution. \\n\\n6 My friend relies on a claimed difference \\n\\n7 between \"an office under\" and \"an officer of the \\n\\n8   United States,\" but this case does not come down to \\n\\n9 mere prepositions.  The two phrases are two sides of \\n\\n10 the same coin, referring to any federal office or to \\n\\n11   anyone who holds one. \\n\\n12 President Trump\\'s other arguments for \\n\\n13 reversal ignore the constitutional role of the states \\n\\n14 in running presidential elections.  Under Article II \\n\\n15 and the Tenth Amendment, states have the power to \\n\\n16 ensure that their citizens\\' electoral votes are not \\n\\n17 wasted on a candidate who is constitutionally barred \\n\\n18 from holding office. \\n\\n19 States are allowed to safeguard their \\n\\n20 ballots by excluding those who are under age, \\n\\n21   foreign-born, running for a third presidential term, \\n\\n22 or, as here, those who have engaged in insurrection \\n\\n23 against the Constitution, in violation of their oath. \\n\\n24 I welcome the Court\\'s questions. \\n\\n25 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Do you have \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                    \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n68 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   contemporaneous examples -- and by contemporaneous, I \\n\\n2 mean shortly after the adoption of the Fourteenth \\n\\n3   Amendment -- where the states disqualified national \\n\\n4 candidates, not its own candidates, but national \\n\\n5   candidates? \\n\\n6 MR. MURRAY: The only example I can think \\n\\n7 of, Justice Thomas, is the example of governor -- of \\n\\n8 -- of Congressman Christy, who was elected in Georgia \\n\\n9 in I believe 1868, and the governor of Georgia \\n\\n10 refused -- or -- or -- declined to certify the \\n\\n11 results of that election because Mr. Christy was \\n\\n12   disqualified. \\n\\n13 But I think it\\'s -- it\\'s not surprising \\n\\n14 that there are few examples because we didn\\'t have \\n\\n15 ballots in the same way back then.  Candidates were. \\n\\n16 Either write-in or -- or they were party \\n\\n17   ballots, so the states didn\\'t run the ballots in the \\n\\n18 same way, and there wouldn\\'t have been a process for \\n\\n19 determining before an election whether a candidate \\n\\n20 was qualified, unlike the processes that we have now \\n\\n21 that states have created under their Article I and \\n\\n22 Article II powers to run elections. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE THOMAS:  But it would seem that \\n\\n24   particularly after Reconstruction and after the \\n\\n25 Compromise of 1877 and during the period of Redeemers \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n69 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 that you would have that kind of conflict.  There \\n\\n2 were a plethora of Confederates still around.  There \\n\\n3 were any number of people who would continue to \\n\\n4   either run for state offices or national offices. \\n\\n5 So it would seem -- it -- that would \\n\\n6 suggest that there would at least be a few examples \\n\\n7 of national candidates being disqualified if your \\n\\n8 reading is correct. \\n\\n9 MR. MURRAY: Well, there were certainly \\n\\n10   national candidates who were disqualified by Congress \\n\\n11   refusing to seat them. \\n\\n12 JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, I understand that, but \\n\\n13 that\\'s not this case. I\\'m talking -- did states \\n\\n14   disqualify them?  That\\'s what we\\'re talking about \\n\\n15 here. I understand Congress would not seat them. \\n\\n16 MR. MURRAY: Other than the example I gave, \\n\\n17 no, but, again, Your Honor, that -- that\\'s not \\n\\n18   surprising because there wouldn\\'t have been -- states \\n\\n19 certainly wouldn\\'t have the authority to remove a \\n\\n20 sitting federal officer. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what\\'s the purpose of \\n\\n22 the -- what was the purpose of the -- of Section 3? \\n\\n23 The states were sending people -- the -- the concern \\n\\n24 was that the former Confederate states would continue \\n\\n25 being bad actors, and the effort was to prevent them \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n70 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 from doing this. \\n\\n2 And you\\'re saying that, well, this also \\n\\n3   authorized states to disqualify candidates.  So what \\n\\n4 I\\'m asking you for, if you are right, what are the \\n\\n5   examples? \\n\\n6 MR. MURRAY: Well, Your Honor, the examples \\n\\n7 are states excluded many candidates for state office, \\n\\n8   individuals holding state offices.  We have a number \\n\\n9 of published cases of states concerning that. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE THOMAS: I understand that.  I -- I \\n\\n11   understand the states controlling state elections and \\n\\n12 state positions.  What we are talking about here are \\n\\n13   national candidates. \\n\\n14 The -- I understand.  You look at Foner or \\n\\n15   Foote, Shelby Foote, or McPherson, they all talk \\n\\n16 about, of course, the conflict after the Civil War, \\n\\n17 and there were people who felt very strongly about \\n\\n18 retaliating against the South, the radical \\n\\n19 Republicans, but they did not think about authorizing \\n\\n20 the South to disqualify national candidates. \\n\\n21 And that\\'s the argument you\\'re making, and \\n\\n22 what I would like to know is you give -- is do you \\n\\n23 have any examples of this? \\n\\n24 MR. MURRAY: Many of those historians have \\n\\n25 filed briefs in our support in this case, making the \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n71 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 point that the -- the -- the idea of the Fourteenth \\n\\n2   Amendment was that both states and the federal \\n\\n3 government would ensure rights and that if states \\n\\n4 failed to do so, the federal government certainly \\n\\n5 would also step in. \\n\\n6 But I think the reason why there aren\\'t \\n\\n7 examples of states doing this is an idiosyncratic one \\n\\n8 of the fact that elections worked differently back \\n\\n9 then. States have a background power under Article \\n\\n10 II and the Tenth Amendment to run presidential \\n\\n11   elections.  They didn\\'t use that power to police \\n\\n12   ballot access until about the 1890s.  And by the \\n\\n13   1890s, everyone had received amnesty and these issues \\n\\n14 had become moot.  So I don\\'t think the history tells \\n\\n15 us --\\n\\n16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I\\'d like \\n\\n17 to sort of look at Justice Thomas\\'s question sort of \\n\\n18 from the 30,000-foot level. I mean, the whole point \\n\\n19 of the Fourteenth Amendment was to restrict state \\n\\n20   power, right?  States shall not abridge privilege of \\n\\n21   immunity, they won\\'t deprive people of property \\n\\n22 without due process, they won\\'t deny equal \\n\\n23   protection.  And on the other hand, it augmented \\n\\n24 federal power under Section 5.  Congress has the \\n\\n25 power to enforce it. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n72 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 So wouldn\\'t that be the last place that \\n\\n2 you\\'d look for authorization for the states, \\n\\n3   including Confederate states, to enforce --\\n\\n4   implicitly authorize to enforce the presidential \\n\\n5   election process?  That -- that seems to be a \\n\\n6   position that is at -- at war with the whole thrust \\n\\n7 of the Fourteenth Amendment and very ahistorical. \\n\\n8 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor.  First, we \\n\\n9 would locate the states\\' authority to run \\n\\n10 presidential elections not in the Fourteenth \\n\\n11   Amendment but in Article II.  And that power is \\n\\n12   nearly plenary to determine the means --\\n\\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but you\\'re \\n\\n14 relying on -- you have no reliance on Section 3, is \\n\\n15 that what you\\'re saying? \\n\\n16 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor.  Certainly, we \\n\\n17 have reliance on Section 3 insofar as Article II \\n\\n18 gives states this broad power to determine how their \\n\\n19   electors are selected, and that broad power implies \\n\\n20 the narrower power to enforce federal constitutional \\n\\n21   qualifications like Section 3. \\n\\n22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the \\n\\n23 narrower power you\\'re looking for is the power of \\n\\n24   disqualification, right?  That is a very specific \\n\\n25 power in the Fourteenth Amendment.  And you\\'re saying \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n73 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 that was implicitly extended to the states under a \\n\\n2 clause that doesn\\'t address that at all? \\n\\n3 MR. MURRAY: We would say that nothing in \\n\\n4 the Fourteenth Amendment takes away from the states \\n\\n5 their broad and nearly plenary power to determine the \\n\\n6 manner of selecting their electors in the manner that \\n\\n7 they see fit. As this Court said in Chiafalo, that \\n\\n8 power is nearly plenary unless something in the \\n\\n9 Constitution tells states they can\\'t do it. \\n\\n10 And -- and the structure of the Fourteenth \\n\\n11 Amendment certainly was intended to expand federal \\n\\n12 power and certainly to restrict state power in some \\n\\n13 ways, but states are bound to enforce and apply, for \\n\\n14   example, Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  And \\n\\n15 so it -- it\\'s hard to see why states wouldn\\'t be \\n\\n16 similarly bound or at least authorized --\\n\\n17 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  But that\\'s -- that\\'s a \\n\\n18 --\\n\\n19 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, just --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- \"greater includes \\n\\n21 the lesser\" argument.  The -- the states have the \\n\\n22   power, the legislature has the power to choose \\n\\n23   electors.  Granted.  But just because there\\'s one \\n\\n24   authorized means in the Constitution to a particular \\n\\n25 end does not mean that there\\'s any means to that end. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n74 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1            And so I think you\\'re taking that electors \\n\\n2   argument and bringing it into Section 3, where, as \\n\\n3 the Chief Justice says, there\\'s just no -- and \\n\\n4 Justice Thomas, there\\'s no historical evidence to \\n\\n5 support kind of the theory of Section 3, nor the \\n\\n6 overall -- to explain the overall structure of -- of \\n\\n7 the Fourteenth Amendment. \\n\\n8 MR. MURRAY: We certainly have a long \\n\\n9 history in this country of states using their power \\n\\n10 to determine the manner of selecting presidential \\n\\n11 electors to enforce other qualifications in the \\n\\n12   Constitution.  I don\\'t -- I don\\'t take it there\\'s a \\n\\n13 great debate about whether or not states are allowed \\n\\n14 to exclude underaged or foreign-born candidates or, \\n\\n15 if President Bush or Obama wanted to run for a third \\n\\n16 term, that they could be excluded under that broad \\n\\n17 Article II power. \\n\\n18 I don\\'t see why Section 3 should be treated \\n\\n19 any differently.  Section 3 speaks in the same \\n\\n20   mandatory terms. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, when you look at \\n\\n22 -- at Section 3, the term \"insurrection\" jumps out, \\n\\n23 and the question is -- the questions are:  What does \\n\\n24 that mean?  How do you define it?  Who decides?  Who \\n\\n25 decides whether someone engaged in it?

MURRAY: Cert --\\n\\n14 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Your response to that? \\n\\n15 MR. MURRAY: Well, certainly, Justice \\n\\n16   Kavanaugh, there has to be some process for \\n\\n17   determining those questions, and then the question \\n\\n18 becomes, does anything in the Fourteenth Amendment \\n\\n19 say that only Congress can create that process?  And \\n\\n20 -- and Section 5 very clearly is not an exclusive \\n\\n21   provision.  It says Congress shall have power.  And \\n\\n22 --\\n\\n23 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But maybe put most baldly, \\n\\n24 I think that the question that you have to confront \\n\\n25 is why a single state should decide who gets to be \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n76 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   president of the United States. In other words, you \\n\\n2 know, this question of whether a former president is \\n\\n3   disqualified for insurrection to be president again \\n\\n4 is, you know, just say it, it sounds awfully national \\n\\n5 to me. So whatever means there are to enforce it \\n\\n6 would suggest that they have to be federal, national \\n\\n7 means. \\n\\n8 Why does -- you know, if you weren\\'t from \\n\\n9 Colorado and you were from Wisconsin or you were from \\n\\n10   Michigan and it really -- you know, what the Michigan \\n\\n11 secretary of state did is going to make the \\n\\n12   difference between, you know, whether Candidate A is \\n\\n13 elected or Candidate B is elected, I mean, that seems \\n\\n14 quite extraordinary, doesn\\'t it? \\n\\n15 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor, because, \\n\\n16 ultimately, it\\'s this Court that\\'s going to decide \\n\\n17 that question of federal constitutional eligibility \\n\\n18 and settle the issue for the nation.  And -- and, \\n\\n19   certainly, it\\'s not unusual that questions of \\n\\n20   national importance come up through a particular \\n\\n21 state. \\n\\n22 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I suppose --\\n\\n23 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well --\\n\\n24 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- this Court would be \\n\\n25 saying something along the lines of that a state has \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                     \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n77 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 the power to do it. But I guess I was -- I was \\n\\n2 asking you to go a little bit further in saying why \\n\\n3 should that be the right rule.  Why should a single \\n\\n4 state have the ability to make this determination not \\n\\n5 only for their own citizens but for the rest of the \\n\\n6 nation? \\n\\n7 MR. MURRAY: Because Article II gives them \\n\\n8 the power to -- to appoint their own electors as they \\n\\n9 see fit.  But, if they\\'re going to use a federal \\n\\n10   constitutional qualification as a ballot access \\n\\n11   determinant, then it\\'s creating a federal \\n\\n12   constitutional question that then this Court decides \\n\\n13 and other courts, other states -- if -- if this Court \\n\\n14 affirms the decision below, determining that \\n\\n15 President Trump is ineligible to be president, other \\n\\n16   states would still have to determine what effect that \\n\\n17 would have on their own state\\'s law and state \\n\\n18   procedure --\\n\\n19 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Well, I mean, if we --\\n\\n20 MR. MURRAY: -- in terms of ballot access. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE BARRETT:  -- if we affirmed and we \\n\\n22 said he was ineligible to be president, yes, maybe \\n\\n23 some states would say, well, you know, we\\'re going to \\n\\n24 keep him on the ballot anyway, but, I mean, really, \\n\\n25 it\\'s going to have, as Justice Kagan said, the effect \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n78 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 of Colorado deciding.  And it\\'s true, I just want to \\n\\n2 push back a little bit on, well, it\\'s a national \\n\\n3 thing because this Court will decide it. \\n\\n4 You say that we have to review Colorado\\'s \\n\\n5 factual record with clear error as the standard of \\n\\n6 review. So we would be stuck.  The first mover \\n\\n7   state, here, Colorado, we\\'re stuck with that record. \\n\\n8 And, you know, I -- I -- I don\\'t want to get into \\n\\n9 whether the -- the record -- I mean, maybe the record \\n\\n10 is great, but what if the record wasn\\'t? I mean, \\n\\n11 what if it wasn\\'t a fulsome record?  What if, you \\n\\n12 know, the -- the hearsay rules are, you know, \\n\\n13   one-offs? Or what if this is just made by the \\n\\n14 secretary of state without much process at all? \\n\\n15 How do we review those factual findings? \\n\\n16 Why should clear error review apply?  And doesn\\'t \\n\\n17 that just kind of buckle back into this point that \\n\\n18 Justice Kagan was making, you know, that -- that we \\n\\n19 made with Mr. Mitchell too that it just doesn\\'t seem \\n\\n20 like a state call? \\n\\n21 MR. MURRAY: Three points, Your Honor.  The \\n\\n22 first is that ordinarily, of course, this Court \\n\\n23 reviews factual findings for clear error, but \\n\\n24   President Trump made the point in -- in his reply \\n\\n25 brief that sometimes on constitutional questions that \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n79 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 require a uniform resolution, this Court can do more, \\n\\n2 something more like a Bose Corp. style independent \\n\\n3 review of the factual record. \\n\\n4 And we would have no objection to that \\n\\n5 given that the record here -- really -- really, the \\n\\n6 facts that are disputed here are incredibly narrow. \\n\\n7 The essence of our case is President Trump\\'s own \\n\\n8 statements that he made in public view for all to \\n\\n9 see. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE BARRETT:  But then that\\'s saying \\n\\n11 that in this context, which is very high stakes, if \\n\\n12 we review the facts essentially de novo, you want us \\n\\n13 all to just watch the video of the Ellipse and then \\n\\n14 make a decision without any deference to or guidance \\n\\n15 from lower court fact finding?  That\\'s unusual. \\n\\n16 MR. MURRAY: Well, ultimately, President \\n\\n17 Trump himself urges this Court to decide the merits \\n\\n18 of his eligibility on the factual record here at page \\n\\n19 2 of his brief. He\\'s never at any point in this \\n\\n20   proceeding suggested there was something else that \\n\\n21 needed to be in the factual record, any other \\n\\n22   witnesses that he wanted to call to present his case. \\n\\n23 And, again, the essence of our case is his \\n\\n24 own statements and -- and -- and, in particular, his \\n\\n25 own videotaped statements on the Ellipse --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n80 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Murray, just to \\n\\n2 circle back to -- I\\'m sorry to interrupt. But I \\n\\n3 wanted to -- before we left it, I wanted to circle \\n\\n4 back to where Justice Kagan was. \\n\\n5 Do you agree that the state\\'s powers here \\n\\n6 over its ballot for federal officer election have to \\n\\n7 come from some constitutional authority? \\n\\n8 MR. MURRAY: Members of this Court have \\n\\n9   disagreed about that. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I\\'m asking you. \\n\\n11 (Laughter.) \\n\\n12 MR. MURRAY: The -- the majority of this \\n\\n13 Court has said that those powers come from Article \\n\\n14 II. But we think that the result is the same whether \\n\\n15 the Court locates it in Article II or in a reserved \\n\\n16 power under the Tenth Amendment. \\n\\n17 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  But -- but you \\n\\n18 accept that this Court has held, you\\'re not \\n\\n19   contesting this or asking us to revisit that decision \\n\\n20 in Thornton or Term Limits or whatever you want to \\n\\n21 call it that it has to come from some federal \\n\\n22   constitutional authority? \\n\\n23 MR. MURRAY: No, we are not, Your Honor. \\n\\n24 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  And -- and -- and, \\n\\n25 here, we\\'re not talking about the Qualifications \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n81 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Clause, right?  Nobody\\'s talking about whether he\\'s \\n\\n2 35 years old or a natural born, whatever, right, not \\n\\n3 -- not at issue, okay? \\n\\n4 We\\'re talking about something under the \\n\\n5   Fourteenth Amendment and Section 3, so that\\'s where \\n\\n6 you have to find your authority, right? \\n\\n7 MR. MURRAY: We find our authority in \\n\\n8 Article II in states\\' plenary power to run their \\n\\n9   elections. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Federal election -- but \\n\\n11 this is for a federal office.  It has to come from \\n\\n12 the Constitution.  And you\\'re seeking to enforce \\n\\n13 Section 3? \\n\\n14 MR. MURRAY: We\\'re suggesting that in their \\n\\n15 broad power to determine the -- to select \\n\\n16   presidential electors in any manner they see fit, \\n\\n17 they can take account of Section 3 and apply Section \\n\\n18 3 --\\n\\n19 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Could they do it without \\n\\n20 Section 3? Could they disqualify somebody for -- you \\n\\n21 -- you know, on whatever basis they wanted outside of \\n\\n22 the Qualifications Clause? \\n\\n23 MR. MURRAY: That would run into Term \\n\\n24 Limits, I think, Your Honor. \\n\\n25 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Yeah, I would think so, \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n82 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 right? So it has to come back to Section 3.  And if \\n\\n2   that\\'s true, how does that work given that Section 3 \\n\\n3   speaks about holding office, not who may run for \\n\\n4 office. It was a point Mr. Mitchell was making \\n\\n5 earlier and I just wanted to give you a chance to \\n\\n6 respond to it because it seems to me that -- that, \\n\\n7 you know, that -- that you\\'re asking to enforce in an \\n\\n8   election -- context a provision of the Constitution \\n\\n9 that speaks to holding office.  So it\\'s different \\n\\n10 than the Qualifications Clause, which is all about \\n\\n11 who can run and then serve, yeah. \\n\\n12            MR. MURRAY: I -- I don\\'t know that it is \\n\\n13   different. \\n\\n14 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay. \\n\\n15 MR. MURRAY: Other qualifications for \\n\\n16   office similarly talk about eligibility for the \\n\\n17 office. There\\'s nothing unconstitutional about a \\n\\n18   30-year-old trying to get on the ballot. \\n\\n19 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Except for this \\n\\n20   disability can be removed, right, under Section 3. \\n\\n21   That\\'s what\\'s different about it.  So thoughts on \\n\\n22 that? \\n\\n23 MR. MURRAY: Well, the fact that there\\'s an \\n\\n24 extraordinary provision for removing the disability \\n\\n25 does not negate the fact that the disability exists \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n83 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 today and it\\'s existed since January 6th, 2021, when \\n\\n2 President Trump engaged in insurrection against the \\n\\n3   Constitution. \\n\\n4 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So were his actions after \\n\\n5 that date, before he left office, ultra vires?  Is \\n\\n6 that -- is that the -- where your theory leads? \\n\\n7 MR. MURRAY: Well, that would raise the \\n\\n8   separate question of whether one can collaterally \\n\\n9   attack the actions of a de facto officer.  And that \\n\\n10 may be the one place in Griffin\\'s Case at the very \\n\\n11 end where we would agree, which is -- which is when \\n\\n12 Justice Chase said, I\\'ve talked to my Supreme Court \\n\\n13   colleagues and we unanimously agree that you can\\'t \\n\\n14 collaterally attack all official actions of an \\n\\n15 officer who\\'s holding -- who\\'s, in fact, holding the \\n\\n16   position under Section --\\n\\n17 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  All right.  But -- but \\n\\n18 just circle back to where we started, right?  That \\n\\n19 this is Section 3. Your authority has to come from \\n\\n20 there. And it\\'s about holding office and it\\'s a \\n\\n21   particular kind of disability that can be removed by \\n\\n22   Congress and it\\'s the only one like that, right? \\n\\n23 They can\\'t remove age or citizenship. \\n\\n24 How should that inform our thoughts about a \\n\\n25 state\\'s efforts to regulate the ballot for a federal \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                   \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n84 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 office? \\n\\n2 MR. MURRAY: The colloquy that my friend \\n\\n3 had with Justice Alito earlier, I think, is \\n\\n4   illustrative here.  The fact that Congress has an \\n\\n5 extraordinary removal power does not negate that the \\n\\n6   disability exists today and exists indefinitely into \\n\\n7 the future, much like the fact that Congress -- that \\n\\n8 the president can pardon somebody for a criminal \\n\\n9   conviction doesn\\'t make that conviction somehow --\\n\\n10 somehow contingent. \\n\\n11 And -- and I would note that if President \\n\\n12 Trump were appointed to an office today, if he were \\n\\n13   appointed as a state judge, he could not hold that \\n\\n14 office, which shows that the disability exists now. \\n\\n15 And -- and the fact that Congress has a \\n\\n16 power to remove the disability doesn\\'t negate the \\n\\n17 present qualification, nor does it implicitly bestow \\n\\n18 on President Trump a constitutional right to run for \\n\\n19 offices that he cannot hold in violation of state law \\n\\n20 and state procedure under Article II. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In fact, there was a --\\n\\n22 a congressional action to permit Confederate officers \\n\\n23 or people who supported the Confederacy to hold \\n\\n24   office before the Fourteenth Amendment, correct?

If -- if \\n\\n12 Colorado\\'s position is upheld, surely, there will be \\n\\n13   disqualification proceedings on the other side, and \\n\\n14 some of those will succeed. \\n\\n15 Some of them will have different standards \\n\\n16 of proof.  Some of them will have different rules \\n\\n17 about evidence.  Maybe the Senate report won\\'t be \\n\\n18   accepted in others because it\\'s hearsay.  Maybe it\\'s \\n\\n19 beyond a reasonable doubt, whatever. \\n\\n20 In very quick order, I would expect, \\n\\n21   although my predictions have never been correct --\\n\\n22 (Laughter.) \\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I would expect \\n\\n24 that, you know, a goodly number of states will say, \\n\\n25 whoever the Democratic candidate is, you\\'re off the \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n86 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 ballot, and others for the Republican candidate, \\n\\n2   you\\'re off the ballot.

Insurrection is a broad, broad term, and \\n\\n14 if there\\'s some debate about it, I suppose that will \\n\\n15 go into the decision and then, eventually, what, we \\n\\n16 would be deciding whether it was an insurrection when \\n\\n17 one president did something as opposed to when \\n\\n18 somebody else did something else? And what do we do? \\n\\n19 Do we wait until near the time of counting the \\n\\n20 ballots and sort of go through which states are valid \\n\\n21 and which states aren\\'t? \\n\\n22 MR.

And --\\n\\n3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me \\n\\n4 you\\'re avoiding the question, which is other states \\n\\n5 may have different views about what constitutes \\n\\n6   insurrection. \\n\\n7 And now you\\'re saying, well, it\\'s all right \\n\\n8 because somebody, presumably us, are going to decide, \\n\\n9 well, they said they thought that was an \\n\\n10   insurrection, but they were wrong.  And maybe they \\n\\n11 thought it was right. And we\\'d have to develop rules \\n\\n12 for what constitutes an insurrection. \\n\\n13 MR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor.  Just like \\n\\n14 this Court interprets other constitutional \\n\\n15   provisions, this Court can make clear that an \\n\\n16   insurrection against the Constitution is something \\n\\n17   extraordinary. \\n\\n18 And, in particular, it really requires a \\n\\n19 concerted group effort to resist through violence not \\n\\n20 some ordinary application of state or federal law but \\n\\n21 the functions mandated by the Constitution itself. \\n\\n22 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  On -- on your point \\n\\n23 that it\\'s been dormant for 155 years, I think the \\n\\n24 other side would say the reason for that is Chief \\n\\n25 Justice Chase\\'s opinion in 1869 in Griffin\\'s Case to \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n88 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   start, which says that Congress has the authority \\n\\n2 here, not the states.  That\\'s followed up by the \\n\\n3 Enforcement Act of 1870, in which Congress acts upon \\n\\n4 that understanding, which is followed -- and there\\'s \\n\\n5 no history contrary in that period, as Justice Thomas \\n\\n6 pointed out, there\\'s no history contrary in all the \\n\\n7 years leading up to this of states exercising such \\n\\n8   authority. \\n\\n9 I think the reason it\\'s been dormant is \\n\\n10 because there\\'s been a settled understanding that \\n\\n11 Chief Justice Chase, even if not right in every \\n\\n12 detail, was essentially right, and the branches of \\n\\n13 the government have acted under that settled \\n\\n14   understanding for 155 years. \\n\\n15 And Congress can change that. And Congress \\n\\n16 does have Section 2383, of course, the Insurrection \\n\\n17 Act, a criminal statute.  But Congress could change \\n\\n18 it, but they have not in the 155 years in relevant \\n\\n19   respects for what you want here today at least. \\n\\n20 MR. MURRAY: No, Justice Kavanaugh.  The \\n\\n21 reason why it\\'s been dormant is because, by 1876, \\n\\n22 essentially, all former Confederates had received \\n\\n23   amnesty.  And we haven\\'t seen anything like an \\n\\n24   insurrection since then. \\n\\n25 I\\'d like to address your point --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n89 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you know, we didn\\'t \\n\\n2 --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I go to that \\n\\n4 point -- can --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- after the --\\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sorry. \\n\\n7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito? \\n\\n8 JUSTICE ALITO:  I don\\'t know how much we \\n\\n9 can infer from the fact that we haven\\'t seen anything \\n\\n10 like this before and therefore conclude that we\\'re \\n\\n11 never -- we\\'re not going to see something in the \\n\\n12 future. \\n\\n13 From the time of the impeachment of \\n\\n14 President Johnson until the impeachment of President \\n\\n15 Clinton more than a hundred years later, there were \\n\\n16 no impeachments of presidents, and in fairly short \\n\\n17 order, over the last couple of decades, we\\'ve had \\n\\n18 three.

And suppose that Candidate A gets a \\n\\n12 majority of the votes in that state, but the \\n\\n13   legislature really doesn\\'t like Candidate A, thinks \\n\\n14   Candidate A is an insurrectionist, so the legislature \\n\\n15 then passes a law ordering its electors to vote for \\n\\n16 the other candidate. \\n\\n17 Do you think the state has that power? \\n\\n18 MR.

But, of \\n\\n8 course, that would be much more extraordinary than \\n\\n9 what we have here, which is simple application of \\n\\n10   normal state ballot access principles to say that \\n\\n11 we\\'re only going to put on the ballot an individual \\n\\n12 who is qualified to assume the office. \\n\\n13 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you again the \\n\\n14 question that Justice Gorsuch asked, and you -- to \\n\\n15 which you responded by citing the de facto officer \\n\\n16   doctrine.  But suppose we look at that going forward \\n\\n17 rather than judging the validity of an act committed \\n\\n18 between the time when a president allegedly engages \\n\\n19 in an insurrection and the time when the president \\n\\n20   leaves office. \\n\\n21 During that interim period, would it be \\n\\n22   lawful for military commanders and other officers to \\n\\n23 disobey orders of the -- of the -- the president in \\n\\n24   question? \\n\\n25 MR.

You say he\\'s disqualified from the \\n\\n6 moment it happens.  Now I understand the de facto \\n\\n7 officer doctrine might be used to prohibit people \\n\\n8 from seeking judicial remedies for decisions that \\n\\n9 take place after the date he was disqualified. \\n\\n10 But, if he is, in fact, disqualified, from \\n\\n11 that moment, why would anybody have to obey a \\n\\n12   direction from him? \\n\\n13 MR. MURRAY: Well, ultimately, there still \\n\\n14 has to be some kind of procedure in place to \\n\\n15   adjudicate the disqualification.  Certainly, Congress \\n\\n16 could impeach a sitting president, but that\\'s the \\n\\n17 only remedy I\\'m aware of that exists for -- for \\n\\n18 removal or otherwise negating the authority of a \\n\\n19 sitting president. \\n\\n20 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why? \\n\\n21 MR.

What would compel a lower official to obey an \\n\\n14 order from that individual? \\n\\n15 MR.

The person is in the office, and even if \\n\\n18 they don\\'t have the authority to hold the office, the \\n\\n19 only way to get someone out of the office of the \\n\\n20   presidency is impeachment, and so I think, if you \\n\\n21 interpreted Section 3 in light of other provisions in \\n\\n22 the Constitution like impeachment, while they hold \\n\\n23 office, impeachment\\'s the only way to validate that \\n\\n24 they don\\'t have the ability to hold that office and \\n\\n25 should be removed. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                         \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n96 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Mr. Murray, can I -- oh. \\n\\n2 Can I just ask you about something -- Justice Kagan \\n\\n3 brought up earlier, which is the concern about \\n\\n4   uniformity and the lack thereof if states are \\n\\n5   permitted to enforce Section 3 in presidential \\n\\n6   elections, and I -- I guess I didn\\'t really \\n\\n7   understand your argument or your response to her \\n\\n8 about that. \\n\\n9 MR.

These \\n\\n18   questions come up to this Court in the same way that \\n\\n19 other federal questions come up to this Court, which \\n\\n20 is that a state adjudicates them.

And so, once one \\n\\n13   understands the sort of imperative that they had to \\n\\n14 ensure that oath-breakers wouldn\\'t take office, it \\n\\n15 would be a little bit odd to say that states can\\'t \\n\\n16 enforce it, that only the federal government can \\n\\n17 enforce it, and that Congress can essentially rip the \\n\\n18 heart out of Section 3 by a simple majority just by \\n\\n19 failing to pass enforcement legislation. \\n\\n20 Federalism creates redundancy.  And, here, \\n\\n21 the fact that states have the ability to enforce it \\n\\n22 as well, absent federal preemption, provides an \\n\\n23   additional layer of safeguards around what really \\n\\n24 Section 3 --\\n\\n25 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah, and I\\'ll --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n98 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR.

This Court \\n\\n19 has never interpreted the aid and comfort language, \\n\\n20 which also is present in the Treason Clause, but \\n\\n21   commentators have suggested -- it\\'s been rarely \\n\\n22 applied because treason prosecutions are so rare, but \\n\\n23 commentators have suggested that, first of all, that \\n\\n24 aid and comfort really only applies in the context of \\n\\n25 a declared war or at least an adversarial \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n99 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   relationship where there is, in fact, a war between \\n\\n2 two countries. \\n\\n3 And -- and, second, the intent standard \\n\\n4 would do a lot of work there because, under Section \\n\\n5 3, whatever the underlying conduct is, engaging in \\n\\n6 insurrection or aid and comfort, has to be done with \\n\\n7 the intent to further the unlawful purpose of the \\n\\n8   insurrection or -- or to aid the enemies in their \\n\\n9 pursuit of war against the United States. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, let me come back to \\n\\n11 the question of what we would do if we were -- if \\n\\n12   different states had adjudicated the question of \\n\\n13 whether former President Trump is an insurrectionist \\n\\n14 using a different record, different rulings on the \\n\\n15   admissibility of evidence, perhaps different \\n\\n16   standards of proof.

Would we \\n\\n25 have to decide what is the appropriate standard of \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                   \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n100 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 proof? Would we give any deference to these findings \\n\\n2 by state court judges, some of whom may be elected? \\n\\n3 Would we have to have our own trial? \\n\\n4 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor.  This Court \\n\\n5   takes the evidentiary record as it -- as it\\'s given. \\n\\n6 And, here, we have an evidentiary record that all the \\n\\n7 parties agree is sufficient for a decision in -- in \\n\\n8 this case. \\n\\n9 And then, as -- as I discussed earlier, \\n\\n10 there\\'s a possibility of a Bose Corp. independent \\n\\n11 review of the facts, but, ultimately, what we have \\n\\n12 here is an insurrection that was incited in plain \\n\\n13 sight for all to see. \\n\\n14 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, but that -- you\\'re \\n\\n15   really not answering my question.  It\\'s not helpful \\n\\n16 if you don\\'t do that. \\n\\n17 We have -- suppose we have two different \\n\\n18 records, two different bodies of evidence, two \\n\\n19   different rulings on questions of admissibility, two \\n\\n20   different standards of proof, two different sets of \\n\\n21 fact findings by two different judges or maybe \\n\\n22   multiple judges in multiple states. \\n\\n23 Then what do we do? \\n\\n24 MR.

MURRAY:  If this Court --\\n\\n6 JUSTICE ALITO:  Of which record? \\n\\n7 MR. MURRAY: If this Court had two cases \\n\\n8 before it and both of the records were sufficient \\n\\n9 insofar as both sides had the opportunity to present \\n\\n10 their case and -- and the essential facts in the \\n\\n11 record that everyone agreed was sufficient for a \\n\\n12   decision, then this Court would have to look at \\n\\n13 the -- the evidence -- the evidence presented and \\n\\n14   decide which -- which holding was correct and then \\n\\n15 decide that issue for the country. \\n\\n16 And, certainly, here, when -- when there is \\n\\n17 a complete record, lower courts then will be applying \\n\\n18 that decision, and I think it\\'s unlikely that any \\n\\n19 court would say we\\'re going to reach a different \\n\\n20 decision than the U.S. Supreme Court did, \\n\\n21 particularly if the Court relies on the facts, the \\n\\n22   indisputable facts, of what President Trump said on \\n\\n23 video and in his Twitter feed, which is really the \\n\\n24 essence of our case here. \\n\\n25 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you had an expert --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n102 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 just take -- let\\'s just take that example -- had an \\n\\n2   expert testify about the meaning of what President \\n\\n3 Trump said.  But do you -- do you think it\\'s possible \\n\\n4 that a different state court would apply Daubert \\n\\n5 differently and say that this person should not be \\n\\n6 allowed to express an expert opinion on that \\n\\n7   question?  Do you think that\\'s beyond the realm of \\n\\n8   imagination? \\n\\n9 MR. MURRAY: Not -- not at all, Your Honor. \\n\\n10 Two points on that.  Number one, President Trump \\n\\n11 didn\\'t appeal the admission of that evidence in this \\n\\n12 case, but -- but, number two, you know, the second \\n\\n13 point is that Professor Simi really -- he didn\\'t \\n\\n14 opine on the meaning of President Trump\\'s words. \\n\\n15 He opined on the effect that those words \\n\\n16 had on violent extremists, and the essence of his \\n\\n17   testimony was built around videotaped statements of \\n\\n18 President Trump himself encouraging, inciting, and \\n\\n19   praising political violence when --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I\\'m not taking a \\n\\n21 position one way or the other about whether the \\n\\n22 expert\\'s testimony should have been admitted or \\n\\n23 anything like that or the meaning of President \\n\\n24 Trump\\'s words. \\n\\n25 I\\'m just trying to get you to grapple with \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n103 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 what some people have seen as the consequences of the \\n\\n2   argument that you\\'re advancing, which is that there \\n\\n3 will be conflicts in decisions among the states, that \\n\\n4   different states will disqualify different \\n\\n5   candidates, but I -- I\\'m not getting a whole lot of \\n\\n6 help from you about how this would not be an \\n\\n7   unmanageable situation. \\n\\n8 MR. MURRAY: If this Court writes an \\n\\n9 opinion affirming on the basis of the indisputable \\n\\n10 facts of what President Trump said on January 6th and \\n\\n11 in the weeks leading up to it and his virtual \\n\\n12   confession on Twitter after the fact, then it would \\n\\n13 be reversible error for any other state to conclude \\n\\n14 otherwise on that question of federal law, or -- or, \\n\\n15 at the very least, this Court could address that when \\n\\n16 those issues come up, but it seems unlikely. \\n\\n17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor? \\n\\n18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There\\'s two sides to --\\n\\n19 to the other side\\'s position.  The first is that it\\'s \\n\\n20 not self-executing. I want to put that aside. \\n\\n21 Deal with if we were to hold that states \\n\\n22 don\\'t have the right to enforce or create a cause of \\n\\n23 action in this situation.

MURRAY: That -- that --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because assume we rule \\n\\n4 that states don\\'t have it. What would you have us \\n\\n5 say for the other side of the argument? One of my \\n\\n6   colleagues says you need or what -- what not -- not \\n\\n7 then Chief Justice but Circuit Court Justice Chase \\n\\n8 said, which is that somehow you need implementing \\n\\n9   legislation, like the 1870 Act. \\n\\n10 You seem to say that\\'s not true because \\n\\n11 they could decide not to seat the -- seat a \\n\\n12   candidate, et cetera.  So I don\\'t know that \\n\\n13   legislation\\'s necessary. \\n\\n14 MR. MURRAY: And, certainly, there are \\n\\n15 historical examples of member -- members of Congress \\n\\n16 under their Article -- under Congress\\'s Article I \\n\\n17 power to judge the qualifications of its members, of \\n\\n18 members of Congress refusing to seat ineligible \\n\\n19   candidates under Section 3 who have won election. \\n\\n20 In the context of the presidency, I think \\n\\n21 it would create a number of really difficult issues \\n\\n22 if the Court says there\\'s no procedure for \\n\\n23   determining President Trump\\'s eligibility until after \\n\\n24 the election. \\n\\n25 And then what happens when members of \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                \\n  \\n\\n105 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Congress on January 6th, when they count the \\n\\n2 electoral votes, say we\\'re not going to count \\n\\n3   electoral votes cast for President Trump because he\\'s \\n\\n4   disqualified under Section 3 under the Electoral \\n\\n5 Count Reform Act. \\n\\n6 A number of the amicus briefs, such as \\n\\n7 those of Professor Ginsberg, Hasen, and Foley, have \\n\\n8 made the point that that is kind of a \\n\\n9   disenfranchisement and constitutional crisis in the \\n\\n10 making and is all the more reason to address those \\n\\n11 issues now in a judicial process on a full \\n\\n12 evidentiary record so that everybody can have \\n\\n13 certainty on those issues before they go to the \\n\\n14 polls. \\n\\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan? \\n\\n16 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Murray, you talked --\\n\\n17 you relied on the states\\' extensive powers under the \\n\\n18   Electors Clause.  You talked about the states having \\n\\n19 a role in enacting, you know, typical ballot access \\n\\n20   provisions. \\n\\n21 I -- I guess -- I guess, you know, it \\n\\n22 strikes me that we\\'ve put some limits on that, and \\n\\n23 I\\'ll just give you Anderson versus Celebrezze as an \\n\\n24 example of that, where we said, in fact, states are \\n\\n25 limited in who they can take off a ballot, and that \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                        \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n106 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 was a case about minor party candidates, but the \\n\\n2 reason was that one state\\'s decision to take a \\n\\n3   candidate off the ballot affects everybody else\\'s \\n\\n4 rights. \\n\\n5 And we talked about the pervasive national \\n\\n6 interest in the selection of candidates for national \\n\\n7 office. We talked about how an individual state\\'s \\n\\n8 decision would have an impact beyond its own borders. \\n\\n9 So, if that goes for minor political party \\n\\n10 candidates, why doesn\\'t it go a fortiori for the \\n\\n11   situation in this case? \\n\\n12 MR. MURRAY: Well, certainly, \\n\\n13   constitutional principles like Section 3 apply to \\n\\n14   everybody, but in -- in Celebrezze, the issue there \\n\\n15 was a First Amendment question, and, certainly, \\n\\n16 there\\'s no doubt that states\\' exercise of their power \\n\\n17 under Article II is constrained by First Amendment \\n\\n18   principles. \\n\\n19 And -- and in -- in that case, the -- the \\n\\n20 state law deadlines for when a minor party candidate \\n\\n21 got on the ballot just came too soon to be reactive \\n\\n22 to what major parties had done and, therefore, risked \\n\\n23 disenfranchising people who were disillusioned with \\n\\n24 who the major parties had picked, and it raised First \\n\\n25   Amendment problems.  Here, there\\'s no real First \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n107 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   Amendment problem and -- and a state is just trying \\n\\n2 to enforce an existing qualification that\\'s baked \\n\\n3 into our constitutional fabric. \\n\\n4 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, I -- I -- I guess, \\n\\n5 you know, it -- it did come up in the First \\n\\n6   Amendment, but there\\'s a broader principle there and \\n\\n7 it\\'s a broader principle about who has power over \\n\\n8 certain things in our federal system, and, you know, \\n\\n9   within our federal system, states have great power \\n\\n10 over many different areas.  But that there\\'s some \\n\\n11 broader principle about that there are certain \\n\\n12 national questions that -- that -- that -- that, you \\n\\n13 -- you know, state -- where states are not the \\n\\n14   repository of authority.  And I took a lot -- First \\n\\n15   Amendment, not First Amendment -- a lot of Anderson\\'s \\n\\n16   reasoning is really about that.  Like, what\\'s a state \\n\\n17 doing deciding who gets to -- who other citizens get \\n\\n18 to vote for for president? \\n\\n19 MR. MURRAY: Colorado is not deciding who \\n\\n20 other states get to vote for for president.  It\\'s \\n\\n21 deciding how to assign its own electors under its \\n\\n22 Article II power. And the Constitution grants them \\n\\n23 that broad power as --\\n\\n24 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but the effect of \\n\\n25 that is obvious, yes? \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n108 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR. MURRAY: No, Your Honor, because \\n\\n2   different states can have different procedures.  Some \\n\\n3   states may allow insurrectionists to be on the \\n\\n4 ballot. They may say we\\'re not looking past the \\n\\n5 papers; we\\'re not going to look into federal \\n\\n6   constitutional questions.  It\\'s the sort of -- I --\\n\\n7 even in this election cycle, there are -- there are \\n\\n8 candidates who are on the ballot in some states even \\n\\n9   though they\\'re not natural-born citizens and off the \\n\\n10 ballot in other states.  And that\\'s just a function \\n\\n11 of states\\' power to enforce -- to preserve their own \\n\\n12   electors and avoid disenfranchisement of their own \\n\\n13   citizens. \\n\\n14 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Thank you. \\n\\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Gorsuch? \\n\\n16 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You haven\\'t had a chance \\n\\n17 to talk about the officer point, and I just want to \\n\\n18 give you an opportunity to do that.  Mr. Mitchell \\n\\n19 makes the argument that particularly in the \\n\\n20 Commissions Clause, for example, all officers are to \\n\\n21 be commissioned by the president, seems to be \\n\\n22   all-encompassing, that language. And I\\'m curious, \\n\\n23 your response to that. \\n\\n24 And along the way, if you would, I -- I --\\n\\n25 I -- I poked a little bit at the difference between \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                       \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n109 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 \"office\" and \"officer\" in the earlier discussion, you \\n\\n2 may recall, but I -- I think one point your -- your \\n\\n3 friends on the other side would make is, well, that\\'s \\n\\n4 just how the Constitution uses those terms.  So, for \\n\\n5 example, we know that the President Pro Tem of the \\n\\n6   Senate and the Speaker of the House are officers of \\n\\n7 the United States because the Constitution says they \\n\\n8 are, but we also know that they don\\'t hold an office \\n\\n9 under the United States because of the \\n\\n10 Incompatibility Clause that says they can\\'t. \\n\\n11 So maybe the Constitution to us today, to a \\n\\n12 -- a lay reader, might look a little odd in \\n\\n13   distinguishing between \"office\" and \"officer,\" not \\n\\n14   prepositions, nouns, a distinction, but maybe that\\'s \\n\\n15 exactly how it works. Thoughts? \\n\\n16 MR. MURRAY: Well, I\\'d start with the idea \\n\\n17 that the -- the meaning of \"officer\" in the 1780s was \\n\\n18 the same meaning that it has today, which is a person \\n\\n19 who holds an office.  And -- and, certainly, in \\n\\n20   particular contexts like the Commissions Clause, it \\n\\n21 -- it appears that that\\'s referring -- you know, that \\n\\n22 that is referring to a narrower class of officers \\n\\n23 because we know that there are --\\n\\n24 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Except it says \"all.\" \\n\\n25 MR. MURRAY: Well, we know that there are \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                         \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n110 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 classes of officers, like the President Pro Tem, who \\n\\n2 -- who don\\'t get their commissions from the \\n\\n3   president. \\n\\n4 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that\\'s because the \\n\\n5   Constitution elsewhere says that. \\n\\n6 MR. MURRAY: We know that the Appointments \\n\\n7 Clause refers to a class of officers who get their \\n\\n8   appointment from the Constitution itself --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mm-hmm. \\n\\n10 MR. MURRAY: -- rather than from \\n\\n11   presidential appointment.  People who get their \\n\\n12   commissions from the president himself are not \\n\\n13   commissioned by the president.  And so, if you read \\n\\n14 the Appointments Clause in line with the Commissions \\n\\n15 Clause, then the Commissions Clause is really talking \\n\\n16 about the president\\'s power.  If one needs a \\n\\n17   commission, it\\'s the president who grants it. \\n\\n18 But I think it\\'s important to bring us back \\n\\n19 to Section 3 in particular because that was 80 years \\n\\n20 --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, before -- before we \\n\\n22 get to that, though, just the distinction between \\n\\n23   \"office\" and \"officer,\" do you -- do you agree that \\n\\n24 the Constitution does make that distinction, \\n\\n25   particularly with respect to the Speaker and \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n111 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   President Pro Tem? \\n\\n2 MR. MURRAY: The Constitution makes that \\n\\n3   distinction, but the -- at least in Section 3, an \\n\\n4 officer of the United States is a person who swears \\n\\n5 an oath and holds an office.  Now the President Pro \\n\\n6 Tem and the Speaker of the House, they don\\'t swear a \\n\\n7   constitutional oath in that capacity.  They swear a \\n\\n8   constitutional oath if they are a senator or \\n\\n9   representative in Congress in that separate \\n\\n10   non-official capacity. But I think that narrow --\\n\\n11 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You agree they are \\n\\n12 officers who don\\'t hold an office? \\n\\n13 MR. MURRAY: They\\'re officers who -- who \\n\\n14 may hold an office but don\\'t swear an oath under \\n\\n15 Article VI in that official capacity. \\n\\n16 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, how can they hold \\n\\n17 an office?  Under the Incompatibility Clause, it says \\n\\n18 they can\\'t. \\n\\n19 MR. MURRAY: Well, I -- I think that\\'s a \\n\\n20 fair point, and I think that that may be an exception \\n\\n21 to the general rule, and one might consider them \\n\\n22 perhaps officers of the House and Senate because they \\n\\n23 are appointed by those bodies and preside over those \\n\\n24 bodies. \\n\\n25 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, no, the \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n112 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   Constitution says they\\'re officers of the United \\n\\n2 States -- so -- so there are some instances when you \\n\\n3 have an officer but not an office? \\n\\n4 MR. MURRAY: Those may be an exceptional \\n\\n5   circumstance. \\n\\n6 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Okay. \\n\\n7 MR. MURRAY: But I would --\\n\\n8 JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you. \\n\\n9 MR. MURRAY: You\\'re welcome. \\n\\n10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kavanaugh? \\n\\n11 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  The concerns of some \\n\\n12   questions have been the states having such power over \\n\\n13 a national office, other questions about the \\n\\n14 different states having different standards of proof, \\n\\n15 and they seem underscored by this case, at least the \\n\\n16   dissenting opinion below.  Justice Samour said, \\n\\n17 \"[I\\'ve] been involved\" -- \"[I\\'ve] been involved in \\n\\n18 the justice system for 33 years now, and what took \\n\\n19 place here doesn\\'t resemble anything I\\'ve seen in a \\n\\n20   courtroom\" and then added, \"What transpired in this \\n\\n21   litigation fell woefully short of what due process \\n\\n22   demands.\" \\n\\n23 Now I don\\'t know whether I agree or not. \\n\\n24 I\\'m not going to take a position on that. But the --\\n\\n25 the fact that someone\\'s complaining not about the \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                   \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                       \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n113 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   bottom-line conclusion but about the very processes \\n\\n2 that were used in the state would seem to -- and that \\n\\n3 that would be permitted seems to underscore the \\n\\n4 concerns that have been raised about state power. \\n\\n5 Just wanted to give you a chance to address that \\n\\n6 because that was powerful language.  Again, not \\n\\n7 disagreeing about the conclusion but about the very \\n\\n8   fairness of the process. \\n\\n9 MR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor, but that \\n\\n10   language was, with respect to Justice Samour, just \\n\\n11 not correct.  President Trump had a five-day trial in \\n\\n12 this case.  He had the opportunity to call any \\n\\n13   witnesses that he wanted.  He had the opportunity to \\n\\n14   cross-examine our witnesses. He had the opportunity \\n\\n15 to testify if he wanted to testify.  And, of course, \\n\\n16 the process was expedited because ballot access \\n\\n17   decisions are always on a fast schedule. \\n\\n18 But, in this whole case, from the trial \\n\\n19 court all the way up to this Court, President Trump \\n\\n20 has never identified a single process, other than \\n\\n21   expert depositions, that he wanted to have that he \\n\\n22 didn\\'t get. He had the opportunity for fact witness \\n\\n23   depositions.  He had the opportunity to call \\n\\n24   witnesses remotely.  He didn\\'t use all of his time at \\n\\n25 trial. There was ample process here, and this is how \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n114 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   ballot access determinations in election cases are \\n\\n2 decided all the time. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Okay.  Second question, \\n\\n4 some of the rhetoric of your position -- I don\\'t \\n\\n5 think it is your position, but some of the rhetoric \\n\\n6 of your position seems to suggest, unless the states \\n\\n7 can do this, no one can prevent insurrectionists from \\n\\n8 holding federal office.  But, obviously, Congress has \\n\\n9 enacted statutes, including one still in effect. \\n\\n10 Section 2383 of Title 18 prohibits insurrection. \\n\\n11 It\\'s a federal criminal statute.  And if you\\'re \\n\\n12   convicted of that, you are -- it says, \"shall be \\n\\n13 disqualified\" from holding any office. \\n\\n14 And so there is a federal statute on the \\n\\n15   books, but President Trump has not been charged with \\n\\n16 that. So what -- what are we to make of that? \\n\\n17 MR. MURRAY: Two things, Your Honor. \\n\\n18 Section 2383 was initially enacted about six years \\n\\n19   before Section 3.  It wasn\\'t meant as implementing \\n\\n20   legislation related to Section 3.  And I would \\n\\n21   emphasize that by the time that Section 3 was \\n\\n22   ratified, most Confederates had already received \\n\\n23   criminal pardons. \\n\\n24 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  I guess the question is \\n\\n25 --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n115 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MR. MURRAY: So --\\n\\n2            JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  -- a little bit \\n\\n3   different, which is, if the concern you have, which I \\n\\n4   understand, is that insurrectionists should not be \\n\\n5 able to hold federal office, there is a tool to \\n\\n6 ensure that that does not happen, namely, federal \\n\\n7   prosecution of insurrectionists.  And I -- and if \\n\\n8   convicted, Congress made clear you are automatically \\n\\n9 barred from holding a federal office.  That tool \\n\\n10 exists, you agree, and could be used but has not --\\n\\n11 could be used against someone who committed \\n\\n12   insurrection.  You agree with that? \\n\\n13 MR. MURRAY: That\\'s absolutely right, Your \\n\\n14 Honor. But I would just make the point that the \\n\\n15 Framers of Section 3 clearly understood that criminal \\n\\n16   prosecutions weren\\'t sufficient because oftentimes \\n\\n17 insurrectionists go unpunished, as was the case in \\n\\n18 the Civil War, and that the least we can do is impose \\n\\n19 a civil disqualification penalty so that even if we \\n\\n20 don\\'t have the stomach to throw someone in jail --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Well, they had the quo \\n\\n22 warranto provision that was in effect then from 18 --\\n\\n23 1870 until 1948, but then, obviously, that dropped \\n\\n24 out and hasn\\'t been seen as necessary since then. \\n\\n25 Last question.

Because \\n\\n6 your position has the effect of disenfranchising \\n\\n7 voters to a significant degree. \\n\\n8 And should that be something -- does that \\n\\n9 come in when we think about should we read Section 3 \\n\\n10 this way or read it that way?  What about the \\n\\n11   background principle, if you agree, of democracy? \\n\\n12 MR. MURRAY: I\\'d like to make three points \\n\\n13 on that, Justice Kavanaugh.  The first is that \\n\\n14   constitutional safeguards are for the purpose of \\n\\n15   safeguarding our democracy not just for the next \\n\\n16   election cycle but for generations to come. \\n\\n17 And -- and, second, Section 3 is designed \\n\\n18 to protect our democracy in that very way. The \\n\\n19 Framers of Section 3 knew from painful experience \\n\\n20 that those who had violently broken their oaths to \\n\\n21 the Constitution couldn\\'t be trusted to hold power \\n\\n22 again because they could dismantle our constitutional \\n\\n23 democracy from within, and so they created a \\n\\n24   democratic safety valve.  President Trump can go ask \\n\\n25   Congress to give him amnesty by a two-thirds vote. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                        \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                   \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n117 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 But, unless he does that, our Constitution protects \\n\\n2 us from insurrectionists. \\n\\n3 And, third, this case illustrates the \\n\\n4 danger of refusing to apply Section 3 as written \\n\\n5 because the reason we\\'re here is that President Trump \\n\\n6 tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who \\n\\n7 voted against him, and the Constitution doesn\\'t \\n\\n8 require that he be given another chance. \\n\\n9 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:  Thank you. \\n\\n10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Barrett? \\n\\n11 JUSTICE BARRETT:  So the general rule is \\n\\n12 that, absent rare circumstances, state courts and \\n\\n13 federal courts share authority.  State courts have \\n\\n14   authority to enforce the Constitution, but there are \\n\\n15 certain limits to that, certain situations in which \\n\\n16 the Constitution itself preempts the states\\' ability \\n\\n17 to resolve constitutional questions. \\n\\n18 And, you know, Tarble\\'s Case is one. And \\n\\n19 you said earlier that once a president is elected, \\n\\n20 you accepted that a state couldn\\'t do anything about \\n\\n21 that, like you couldn\\'t -- Colorado couldn\\'t enact \\n\\n22 its own say quo warranto provision and then use it to \\n\\n23 get the secretary of state or the president or anyone \\n\\n24 else out of office, and I -- I assume that\\'s because \\n\\n25 of this principle of structural preemption. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                            \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n118 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Am I right? \\n\\n2 MR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Okay.  So I just want to \\n\\n4 clarify what that means for your argument.  That \\n\\n5 means that your eggs are really in the basket of the \\n\\n6 Electors Clause, really in the Article I basket, \\n\\n7 because you\\'re saying that even though all of the \\n\\n8   questions that people have been asking have suggested \\n\\n9 that there\\'s a problem with giving a single state the \\n\\n10 authority to render a decision that would have an \\n\\n11 effect on a national election, but you\\'re saying that \\n\\n12 those structural concerns, which might otherwise lead \\n\\n13 to the kind of result that you would accept after \\n\\n14 someone is in office, are overcome by the Electors \\n\\n15 Clause? \\n\\n16 MR. MURRAY: Absolutely.  States run \\n\\n17   presidential elections.  That\\'s very clear from \\n\\n18 Article II. Once states have selected the electors \\n\\n19 and the electors have voted, states have no more \\n\\n20 power over the -- the candidate who has been then \\n\\n21   nominated for president. But, until then, the states \\n\\n22 do have the power to adjudicate those issues. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Thank you. \\n\\n24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Jackson? \\n\\n25 JUSTICE JACKSON:  So, when I asked you \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n119 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 earlier about the uniformity concern and the \\n\\n2   troubling potential disuniformity of having different \\n\\n3   states enforce Section 3 with respect to presidential \\n\\n4   elections, you seemed to point to history in a \\n\\n5 certain way.  You said, I think, that the Framers \\n\\n6 actually envisioned states enforcing Section 3 at \\n\\n7 least in some circumstances where there were \\n\\n8   insurgents and Confederates. \\n\\n9 And I guess, in my view of the history, I\\'m \\n\\n10 wondering really whether presidential elections were \\n\\n11 such a circumstance, that the Framers actually \\n\\n12   envisioned states enforcing Section 3 with respect to \\n\\n13 presidential elections as opposed to senatorial \\n\\n14   elections, representatives, the sort of more local \\n\\n15   concerns. \\n\\n16 So can you speak to the argument that \\n\\n17   really Section 3 was about preventing the South from \\n\\n18 rising again in the context of these sort of local \\n\\n19 elections as opposed to focusing on the presidency? \\n\\n20 MR. MURRAY: Well, two points on that, \\n\\n21 Justice Jackson.  First is that, as I discussed \\n\\n22   earlier, there isn\\'t the same history of states \\n\\n23   regulating ballot access at this time, so ballot \\n\\n24   access rules to restrict presidential candidates \\n\\n25   wouldn\\'t have -- wouldn\\'t have existed.  They \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                         \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                        \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n120 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 wouldn\\'t have been raised one way or another. \\n\\n2 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Right, but --\\n\\n3 MR. MURRAY: So --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- I\\'m not making a --\\n\\n5 MR. MURRAY: But --\\n\\n6 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- distinction between \\n\\n7   ballot access and --\\n\\n8 MR. MURRAY: No.  My --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE JACKSON:  -- anything else.  Yeah. \\n\\n10 MR. MURRAY: Understood.  But the more --\\n\\n11 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yeah. \\n\\n12 MR. MURRAY: -- the more broad point I want \\n\\n13 to make is that what is very clear from the history \\n\\n14 is -- is that the Framers were concerned about \\n\\n15   charismatic rebels who might rise through the ranks \\n\\n16 up to and including the presidency of the United \\n\\n17 States. \\n\\n18 JUSTICE JACKSON: But then why didn\\'t they \\n\\n19 put the word \"president\" in the very enumerated list \\n\\n20 in Section 3?  The thing that really is troubling to \\n\\n21 me is I totally understand your argument, but they \\n\\n22 were listing people that were barred and president is \\n\\n23 not there. \\n\\n24 And so I guess that just makes me worry \\n\\n25 that maybe they weren\\'t focusing on the president, \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n121 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 and, for example, the fact that electors of vice \\n\\n2 president and president are there suggests that \\n\\n3 really what they thought was, if we\\'re worried about \\n\\n4 the charismatic person, we\\'re going to bar \\n\\n5   insurrectionist electors and, therefore, that person \\n\\n6 is never going to rise. \\n\\n7 MR. MURRAY: This came up in the debates in \\n\\n8   Congress over Section 3 where Reverdy Johnson said, \\n\\n9 why haven\\'t you included president and vice president \\n\\n10 in the language?  And Senator Moore responds, we \\n\\n11 have. Look at the language, \"any office under the \\n\\n12   United States.\" \\n\\n13 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. But doesn\\'t that at \\n\\n14 least suggest ambiguity? And this sort of ties into \\n\\n15 Justice Kavanaugh\\'s point. \\n\\n16 In other words, we had a -- a person right \\n\\n17 there at the time saying what I\\'m saying, the -- the \\n\\n18   language here doesn\\'t seem to include president, why \\n\\n19 is that? \\n\\n20 And so, if there\\'s an ambiguity, why would \\n\\n21 we construe it to -- as Justice Kavanaugh pointed \\n\\n22 out -- against democracy? \\n\\n23 MR. MURRAY: Well, Reverdy Johnson came \\n\\n24 back and agreed with that reading.  \"Any office\" is \\n\\n25   clear, the Constitution says about 20 times that the \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n  \\n\\n122 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   presidency is an office and --\\n\\n2 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I don\\'t -- I\\'m not \\n\\n3 going to that. So let me -- let me -- let me just \\n\\n4 say you -- so your point is that it -- that there\\'s \\n\\n5 no ambiguity with -- with -- with -- with having a \\n\\n6 list and not having \"president\" in it, with having a \\n\\n7 history that suggests that they were really focused \\n\\n8 on local concerns in the South, with this \\n\\n9 conversation where the legislators actually discussed \\n\\n10 what looked like an ambiguity, you\\'re saying there is \\n\\n11 no -- ambiguity in Section 3? \\n\\n12 MR. MURRAY: Let me take the point \\n\\n13   specifically about electors and senators if I might \\n\\n14 because I think that\\'s --\\n\\n15 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Yes. \\n\\n16 MR. MURRAY: -- important.  Presidential \\n\\n17 electors were not covered because they don\\'t hold an \\n\\n18 office. They vote.  And -- and this Court\\'s decision \\n\\n19 --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE JACKSON:  No, I\\'m talking about the \\n\\n21   barred office part of this, right? \\n\\n22 MR. MURRAY: Exactly.  So the barred office \\n\\n23 is, if you want to include everybody, first, you have \\n\\n24 to specify presidential electors because they\\'re not \\n\\n25 offices, so they wouldn\\'t fall under any office. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n  \\n\\n123 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Second of all, senators and representatives \\n\\n2 don\\'t hold office either.  The Constitution tells us \\n\\n3 that under the Incompatibility Clause and refers to \\n\\n4 them as holding seats, not offices.  And so you want \\n\\n5 to make sure that there is no doubt that senators and \\n\\n6   representatives are covered. Given that the \\n\\n7   Constitution suggests otherwise, you have to include \\n\\n8 them. \\n\\n9 The Constitution says the presidency holds \\n\\n10 an office, as do members of this Court.  And so other \\n\\n11 high offices, the president, vice president, members \\n\\n12 of this Court --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE JACKSON:  All right.  Let me -- let \\n\\n14 me ask you -- I -- I -- I appreciate that argument. \\n\\n15 If we think that the states can\\'t enforce \\n\\n16 this provision for whatever reason in this context, \\n\\n17 in the presidential context, what happens next in \\n\\n18 this case?  I mean, are -- is it done? \\n\\n19 MR. MURRAY: If this Court concludes that \\n\\n20 Colorado did not have the authority to exclude \\n\\n21   President Trump from the presidential ballot on \\n\\n22   procedural grounds, I think -- I think this case \\n\\n23 would be done, but I think it could come back with a \\n\\n24   vengeance because, ultimately, members of Congress --\\n\\n25 may have to make the -- the determination after a \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                       \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n124 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1   presidential election if President Trump wins about \\n\\n2 whether or not he is disqualified from office and \\n\\n3 whether to count votes cast for him under the \\n\\n4   Electoral Count Reform Act. \\n\\n5 So President Trump himself urges this Court \\n\\n6 in the first few pages of his brief to resolve the \\n\\n7 issues on the merits, and we think that the Court \\n\\n8 should do so as well. \\n\\n9 JUSTICE JACKSON:  And there is no federal \\n\\n10   litigation you would say? \\n\\n11 MR. MURRAY: Well, that\\'s correct, because \\n\\n12 there is no federal procedure for deciding these \\n\\n13 issues, short of a criminal prosecution. \\n\\n14 JUSTICE JACKSON:  Thank you. \\n\\n15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. \\n\\n16 Ms. Stevenson. \\n\\n17 MS. STEVENSON:  Mr. Chief Justice. \\n\\n18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Anderson -- no, \\n\\n19   Stevenson.  That\\'s right.  I\\'m sorry. \\n\\n20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON W. STEVENSON \\n\\n21 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT GRISWOLD \\n\\n22 MS. STEVENSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may \\n\\n23 it please the Court: \\n\\n24 Exercising its far-reaching powers under \\n\\n25 the Electors Clause, Colorado\\'s legislature \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n125 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 specifically directed Colorado\\'s courts to resolve \\n\\n2 any challenges to the listing of any candidate on the \\n\\n3   presidential primary ballot before Coloradans cast \\n\\n4 their votes. \\n\\n5 Despite this law, Petitioner contends that \\n\\n6 Colorado must put him on the ballot because of the \\n\\n7 possibility there would be a super majority act of \\n\\n8   Congress to remove his legal disability. \\n\\n9 Under this theory, Colorado and every other \\n\\n10 state would have to indulge this possibility not just \\n\\n11 for the primary but through the general election and \\n\\n12 up to the moment that an ineligible candidate was \\n\\n13 sworn into office. \\n\\n14 Nothing in the Constitution strips the \\n\\n15 states of their power to direct presidential \\n\\n16   elections in this way.  This case was handled capably \\n\\n17 and efficiently by the Colorado courts under a \\n\\n18 process that we\\'ve used to decide ballot challenges \\n\\n19 for more than a century.  And as everyone agrees, the \\n\\n20 Court now has the record that it needs to resolve \\n\\n21 these important issues. \\n\\n22 I welcome your questions. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Is there an express \\n\\n24   provision with respect to -- that defines what a \\n\\n25   qualified candidate is? \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n126 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 MS. STEVENSON:  No, Your Honor, there\\'s not \\n\\n2 an express provision.  When the Colorado Supreme \\n\\n3 Court looked at this, they looked at the need to be \\n\\n4   qualified, plus the fact that the -- this part was --\\n\\n5 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So what does it say then \\n\\n6 if -- if it\\'s not express?  How do we get to this \\n\\n7 issue of qualified candidate? \\n\\n8 MS. STEVENSON:  What the court -- the \\n\\n9   Colorado Supreme Court did -- and I -- let me, if I \\n\\n10 could have a standing objection, I do want to make \\n\\n11 the argument that you shouldn\\'t review the Court\\'s \\n\\n12   statutory interpretation. \\n\\n13 JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, I\\'m just looking at \\n\\n14 the statute. \\n\\n15 MS. STEVENSON:  Sure.  Right. What the \\n\\n16 Court did was to say that we have three important \\n\\n17   provisions in this section that show that candidates \\n\\n18 have to be qualified.  First, it requires that under \\n\\n19 12032(a) that a political party that wants to \\n\\n20 participate has to have a qualified candidate. \\n\\n21 It also looked at the fact that the \\n\\n22   comparable write-in candidates also had to be \\n\\n23   qualified, and --\\n\\n24 JUSTICE THOMAS:  I know, but this isn\\'t a \\n\\n25   write-in candidate. So we\\'re actually talking about \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n                   \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n127 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 the participation of a political party, right?  We\\'re \\n\\n2 not talking about the participation of a -- of a \\n\\n3   candidate? \\n\\n4 MS. STEVENSON:  Sure.  I think the -- that \\n\\n5 the fact that the write-in candidate also had to be \\n\\n6 qualified was confirmatory of the fact that the \\n\\n7 political party candidate also had to be qualified, \\n\\n8 and it would be otherwise incongruous to read those \\n\\n9   things differently. \\n\\n10 JUSTICE THOMAS:  So how is Section 3 a \\n\\n11   qualification? \\n\\n12 MS. STEVENSON: Under the reasoning of the \\n\\n13   Colorado Supreme Court, a candidate --\\n\\n14 JUSTICE THOMAS:  No, just on the -- on its \\n\\n15 face. \\n\\n16 MS. STEVENSON:  A -- a candidate must have \\n\\n17 -- meet all the criteria for eligibility.  And I \\n\\n18 don\\'t perceive any distinction between being --\\n\\n19 meeting the --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay. \\n\\n21 MS. STEVENSON:  -- eligibility criteria and \\n\\n22 not being disqualified.  There -- I just don\\'t see \\n\\n23 any meaningful difference between those two things. \\n\\n24 JUSTICE THOMAS:  Thank you. \\n\\n25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n                           \\n  \\n\\n128 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 represent the secretary of state, right? \\n\\n2 MS.

STEVENSON:  Administratively and what \\n\\n8 the deputy elections director testified to at the \\n\\n9 hearing is that if they obtain objective --\\n\\n10   objective, knowable information, the secretary can \\n\\n11 act on that and inform the candidate --\\n\\n12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the secretary at \\n\\n13 first decides whether that\\'s objective, knowable \\n\\n14   information? \\n\\n15 MS. STEVENSON:  In some instances.  In this \\n\\n16 case, the challenge was actually brought before the \\n\\n17 candidate\\'s paperwork had even been submitted, and \\n\\n18 because there had already been a challenge asserted \\n\\n19 and -- and put into the proper court procedure, the \\n\\n20   secretary didn\\'t even make that determination because \\n\\n21 she didn\\'t have the paperwork. \\n\\n22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- in \\n\\n23 another case where that wasn\\'t the procedure that was \\n\\n24   filed, somebody comes in --\\n\\n25 MS.

STEVENSON:  I think anything that even \\n\\n9   presented that level of controversy about one person \\n\\n10 having a set of facts that they said proved this \\n\\n11 would send this case to the 113 procedure that we use \\n\\n12 to resolve ballot challenge issues like that, and if \\n\\n13 -- if another elector or the individual who brought \\n\\n14 the information didn\\'t want to bring it, the \\n\\n15 secretary herself could bring that action. \\n\\n16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a \\n\\n17   provision for judicial review of the secretary of \\n\\n18 state\\'s action both in Colorado and perhaps what you \\n\\n19 know about other states? \\n\\n20 MS. STEVENSON:  Well, certainly, in \\n\\n21   Colorado, if -- any action that the secretary takes \\n\\n22 that anyone wants to challenge, they can use the 113 \\n\\n23 process to do so.  I think states have varying \\n\\n24 degrees of that.  There are certainly other states \\n\\n25 that allow versions of that, and then I don\\'t know \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n               \\n  \\n\\n130 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 whether there are others that don\\'t.  I certainly \\n\\n2 know that there are some that do. \\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO:  I think we\\'re told that \\n\\n4 there are states that do not provide for any judicial \\n\\n5 review of a secretary of state\\'s determination.  Is \\n\\n6 that incorrect? \\n\\n7 MS. STEVENSON:  No, no.  I think that\\'s \\n\\n8 right, and I think there are some states that \\n\\n9 actually have no mechanism, to come to, I think, \\n\\n10 Justice Kagan\\'s point, or there are some states that \\n\\n11 don\\'t have any mechanism to exclude a disqualified \\n\\n12   candidate from the ballot at all.  And I do want to \\n\\n13 speak to that for just a minute about the -- the \\n\\n14   actual impact of --\\n\\n15 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would that be \\n\\n16   constitutional, if the -- the secretary of state\\'s \\n\\n17   determination was final? \\n\\n18 MS. STEVENSON:  I think so, under Article \\n\\n19 II, the Electors Clause, Your Honor, that that be \\n\\n20 would be constitutional.  States get very broad \\n\\n21 authority to determine how to run their presidential \\n\\n22   elections. \\n\\n23 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could a state enact a \\n\\n24 statute that provides different rules of evidence and \\n\\n25   different rules of procedure and different standards \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                   \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n                    \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n131 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 of proof for this type of proceeding than for other \\n\\n2 civil proceedings? \\n\\n3 MS. STEVENSON:  Yes, Your Honor, I believe \\n\\n4 it could under the same Electors Clause power. \\n\\n5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That issue would be \\n\\n6   determined under perhaps a different constitutional \\n\\n7   provision, like the Due Process Clause, correct? \\n\\n8 MS. STEVENSON:  Correct.  The bounds of the \\n\\n9 Electors Clause are other constitutional constraints, \\n\\n10 which would include due process, equal protection, \\n\\n11 First Amendment. \\n\\n12 JUSTICE BARRETT:  What\\'s the due process \\n\\n13 right? Does the candidate have a due process right? \\n\\n14   What\\'s the liberty interest? \\n\\n15 MS. STEVENSON:  I think it -- it\\'s not very \\n\\n16 precisely defined in the case law, but I think there \\n\\n17 is a recognition that there is a -- a liberty \\n\\n18   interest of a candidate and -- and there is some due \\n\\n19 process interest in -- in being able to access the \\n\\n20 ballot. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE BARRETT:  I thought that was -- I \\n\\n22 thought that was for voters.  You -- you think for \\n\\n23 the candidate too, that there\\'s -- that it would be \\n\\n24   taking something away from the candidate? \\n\\n25 MS. STEVENSON:  Certainly, yes.  And I \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n132 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 think a lot of times you see that in the First \\n\\n2   Amendment context, where candidates can have an issue \\n\\n3 about being on the ballot, but it\\'s sort of a hybrid \\n\\n4 or oftentimes First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, \\n\\n5   Qualifications Clause, all discussed together. \\n\\n6 JUSTICE BARRETT:  Let me ask you a question \\n\\n7 about -- just follow-up to Justice Alito. You know, \\n\\n8 these decisions might be made different ways in \\n\\n9   different states.  Maybe a secretary of state makes \\n\\n10 it in one state with very little process, or a \\n\\n11 process more like Colorado\\'s could be followed by \\n\\n12 others. \\n\\n13 Would our standard of review of the record \\n\\n14 vary depending on the procedure employed by the \\n\\n15 state? \\n\\n16 MS. STEVENSON:  I think this Court has \\n\\n17   tremendous discretion to decide its standard of \\n\\n18   review, and it might be based on the process that was \\n\\n19   employed by an individual state.  I think you could \\n\\n20   exercise the independent review of Bose Corp. that \\n\\n21 Mr. Murray talked about, or you could give deference \\n\\n22 where you have a full-blown proceeding like the one \\n\\n23 here that had all the protections of Rules of \\n\\n24   Evidence and cross-examination and things like that. \\n\\n25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- I\\'m sorry. \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n                \\n \\n                \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n133 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 You think we should give deference in reviewing the \\n\\n2 factual record, the legal conclusions?  What -- in \\n\\n3 other words, we shouldn\\'t undertake a de novo review? \\n\\n4 MS. STEVENSON:  I don\\'t think the review \\n\\n5 should be de novo.  However, I\\'m -- I am amenable to \\n\\n6 the suggestion that the Court would do the Bose Corp. \\n\\n7 type independent review that might provide greater \\n\\n8 certainty to states around the country as to what the \\n\\n9 Court\\'s position is on the factual record in this \\n\\n10 case. \\n\\n11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, if it \\n\\n12 were not de novo review, we could reach disparate \\n\\n13 results even on the same record, right? \\n\\n14 MS. STEVENSON:  I -- I think that\\'s \\n\\n15   possible. \\n\\n16 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I take it your \\n\\n17   position is that this disqualification is really the \\n\\n18   same as any other disqualification, age or residence \\n\\n19 or what have you. \\n\\n20 MS. STEVENSON:  That\\'s correct. \\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and -- and what if I \\n\\n22 were to push back on that and say, well, this \\n\\n23   disqualification, number one, it\\'s in the Fourteenth \\n\\n24   Amendment, and the point of the Fourteenth Amendment \\n\\n25 was to take away certain powers from the states? \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n134 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 Number two, Section 3 itself gives Congress a very \\n\\n2   definite role, which Mr. Mitchell says is interfered \\n\\n3 with by the ability of states to take somebody off \\n\\n4 the ballot?  And maybe, number three, it\\'s just more \\n\\n5   complicated and more contested and, if you want, more \\n\\n6   political?  And why don\\'t all of those things make a \\n\\n7   difference in our thinking about this qualification \\n\\n8 as opposed to any other? \\n\\n9 MS. STEVENSON:  And so, Your Honor, I think \\n\\n10 the trouble with the -- categorizing the insurrection \\n\\n11 issue as -- as necessarily more difficult is it\\'s \\n\\n12 just an assumption that\\'s coming up, I think, because \\n\\n13 of this case. \\n\\n14 And, again, back to the Chief Justice\\'s \\n\\n15 point, we could have a very easy case under the \\n\\n16   Fourteenth Amendment with an avowed insurrectionist \\n\\n17 who, you know, came in and wrote on his paperwork, I \\n\\n18 engaged in an insurrection in violation of the \\n\\n19   Fourteenth Amendment, and it would be a -- a \\n\\n20   open-and-shut case as to whether or not that person \\n\\n21 would meet the qualifications to be on the Colorado \\n\\n22   ballot. \\n\\n23 With respect to your other questions about \\n\\n24 the Fourteenth Amendment, my positions are based on \\n\\n25 the assumption that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                  \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n  \\n\\n135 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 the states have the power to enforce Section 3, just \\n\\n2 like they do other presidential qualifications, and I \\n\\n3 would defer to the electors arguments on those \\n\\n4 points. \\n\\n5 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose a state that does \\n\\n6   recognize non-mutual collateral estoppel makes a \\n\\n7   determination using whatever procedures it decides to \\n\\n8 adopt that a particular candidate is an \\n\\n9   insurrectionist. \\n\\n10 Could that have a cascading effect, and so \\n\\n11 the decision by a court in one state -- the decision \\n\\n12 by a single judge whose factual findings are given \\n\\n13 deference, maybe an elected trial judge, would have \\n\\n14   potentially an enormous effect on the candidates who \\n\\n15 run for president across the country?  Is that \\n\\n16 something we should be concerned about? \\n\\n17 MS. STEVENSON:  I think you should be \\n\\n18   concerned about it, Your Honor, but I think the \\n\\n19 concern is not as high as maybe it\\'s made out to be \\n\\n20 in -- in particularly some of the amicus briefs. \\n\\n21 And, again, under Article II, there is a huge amount \\n\\n22 of disparity in the candidates that end up on the \\n\\n23 ballot on -- in different states in every election. \\n\\n24 Just this election, there\\'s a candidate who \\n\\n25   Colorado excluded from the primary ballot who is on \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n136 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 the ballot in other states even though he is not a \\n\\n2   natural-born citizen. And that\\'s just a -- that\\'s a \\n\\n3 feature of our process.  It\\'s not a bug. \\n\\n4 And then I think, with respect to the \\n\\n5   decision-making and -- and -- you know, we\\'re here so \\n\\n6 that this Court can give us nationwide guidance on \\n\\n7 some of the legal principles that are involved.  I \\n\\n8 think that reduces the potential amount of disparity \\n\\n9 that would arise between the states. \\n\\n10 And then, with respect to the factual \\n\\n11 record and how that gets issued and implemented, the \\n\\n12 states have processes for this, and I think we need \\n\\n13 to let that play out and accept that there may be \\n\\n14 some messiness of federalism here because that\\'s what \\n\\n15 the Electors Clause assumes will happen.  And if \\n\\n16   different states apply their principles of -- of \\n\\n17   collateral estoppel and come to different results, \\n\\n18   that\\'s okay.  And -- and Congress is -- can -- can \\n\\n19 act at any time if -- if it thinks that it\\'s truly \\n\\n20   federalism run amok. \\n\\n21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Thomas, \\n\\n22   anything further? \\n\\n23 Justice Alito? \\n\\n24 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just one further \\n\\n25   question, and it\\'s along the same lines of a lot of \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                   \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n             \\n \\n               \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n137 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 other questions.

What \\n\\n5 about that situation? \\n\\n6 MS. STEVENSON:  Your Honor, I -- I think we \\n\\n7 have to have faith in our system that people will \\n\\n8   follow their election process -- processes \\n\\n9   appropriately, that they will take realistic views of \\n\\n10 what insurrection is under the Fourteenth Amendment. \\n\\n11 Courts will review those decisions.  This Court may \\n\\n12 review some of them. \\n\\n13 But I don\\'t think that this Court should --\\n\\n14 should take those threats too seriously in its \\n\\n15   resolution of this case. \\n\\n16 JUSTICE ALITO:  You don\\'t think that\\'s a \\n\\n17 serious threat? \\n\\n18 MS. STEVENSON:  I -- I -- I think we have \\n\\n19   processes --\\n\\n20 JUSTICE ALITO:  We should proceed on the \\n\\n21   assumption that it\\'s not a serious threat? \\n\\n22 MS.

But nor \\n\\n8 can it exercise its power in a manner that would \\n\\n9 violate the constitutional holding of U.S. Term \\n\\n10   Limits against Thornton and they cannot use the \\n\\n11   Electors Clause as an excuse to impose additional \\n\\n12   qualifications for the presidency that go beyond what \\n\\n13 the Constitution enumerates in Article II. \\n\\n14 And the problem with what the Colorado \\n\\n15 Supreme Court has done is they have in a way changed \\n\\n16 the criteria in Section 3 by making it a requirement \\n\\n17 that must be met before the candidate who is seeking \\n\\n18   office actually holds the office, effectively moving \\n\\n19 forward in time the deadline that the candidate has \\n\\n20 for obtaining a congressional waiver. \\n\\n21 There has still been no answer from the \\n\\n22   Anderson litigants on how to distinguish the \\n\\n23 congressional residency cases, where the courts of \\n\\n24 appeals, not decisions from this Court, but the \\n\\n25 courts of appeals in applying this Court \\'s holding \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n              \\n \\n                  \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n                \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n             \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n  \\n\\n140 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 in U.S. Term Limits have unanimously disapproved \\n\\n2 state laws requiring congressional candidates to show \\n\\n3 that they inhabit the state from which they seek \\n\\n4   election prior to Election Day. \\n\\n5 And there still in our view is no possible \\n\\n6 way to distinguish those from the situation below in \\n\\n7 the Colorado Supreme Court. \\n\\n8 Mr. Murray also invoked the de facto \\n\\n9 officer doctrine as a possible way to mitigate the \\n\\n10 dramatic consequences that would follow from the \\n\\n11 decision of this Court that rejects the rationale of \\n\\n12   Griffin\\'s Case and that also agrees with Mr. Murray\\'s \\n\\n13   contentions that President Trump is disqualified from \\n\\n14 holding office on account of the events of January \\n\\n15 6th and that he\\'s covered by Section 3 as an officer \\n\\n16 of the United States. \\n\\n17 This Court\\'s recent decisions in Lucia and \\n\\n18 Arthrex held that officers who are unconstitutionally \\n\\n19 appointed under Article II and that made decisions \\n\\n20 under the APA that were attacked as invalid, those \\n\\n21   decisions were still vacated and this Court did not \\n\\n22 use any variant of the de facto officer doctrine to \\n\\n23 salvage the decisions that were made by these \\n\\n24   unconstitutionally appointed officers. \\n\\n25 There is no way to escape the conclusion \\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n             \\n \\n                  \\n \\n               \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n              \\n \\n               \\n \\n            \\n \\n             \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n                       \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n \\n            \\n\\n141 \\n\\nOfficial \\n\\n1 that if this Court rejects Griffin\\'s Case and also \\n\\n2   agrees with Mr. Murray\\'s construction of Section 3 \\n\\n3 that every executive action taken by the Trump \\n\\n4 Administration during its last two weeks in office is \\n\\n5   vulnerable to attack under the APA and, further, that \\n\\n6 if President Trump is reelected and sworn in as the \\n\\n7 next president, that any executive action that he \\n\\n8 takes could be attacked in federal court by anyone \\n\\n9 who continues to believe that President Trump is \\n\\n10 barred from office under Section 3. \\n\\n11 I\\'m happy to answer any other questions \\n\\n12 that the Court may have. \\n\\n13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. \\n\\n14 MR.

       "  'words': '  Mr. Chief Justice, and may \\n it please the Court: \\n The Colorado Supreme Court held that \\n   President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally \\n   disqualified from serving as president under \\n Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Colorado \\n Supreme Court\\'s decision is wrong and should be \\n   reversed for numerous independent reasons. \\n The first reason is that President Trump is \\n not covered by Section 3 because the president is not \\n \"an officer of the United States\" as that term is \\n used throughout the Constitution.  \"Officer of the \\n   United States\" refers only to appointed officials, \\n and it does not encompass elected individuals, such \\n as the President or members of Congress.  This is \\n clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment \\n Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which \\n uses \"officers of the United States\" to refer only to \\n\\n \\n   appointed and not elected officials. \\n The second reason is that Section 3 cannot \\n be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the \\n ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from \\n serving as president under Section 3 because Congress \\n can lift that disability after the candidate is \\n elected but before he takes office.  A state cannot \\n exclude any candidate for federal office from the \\n ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that \\n does so is violating the holding of Term Limits by \\n   altering the Constitution\\'s qualifications for \\n federal office. \\n The Colorado Supreme Court\\'s decision is no \\n   different from a state residency law that requires \\n members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to \\n Election Day, when the Constitution requires only \\n that members of Congress inhabit the state that they \\n   represent when elected. \\n In both situations, a state is accelerating \\n the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed \\n   qualification and is thereby violating the holding of \\n Term Limits.  And in this situation, a ruling from \\n this Court that affirms the decision below would not \\n only violate Term Limits but take away the votes of \\n   potentially tens of millions of Americans. \\n\\n \\n I welcome the Court\\'s questions.

So, \\n under Griffin's Case, which we believe is correctly \\n decided -- the Anderson litigants disagree with us on \\n\\n \\n that point -- but, if this Court were to adhere to \\n the holding of Griffin's Case, there would not be any \\n role for the states in enforcing Section 3 unless \\n   Congress were to enact a statute that gives them that \\n   authority. \"},\n",

For the first time in \\n history, the attack was incited by a sitting \\n president of the United States to disrupt the \\n   peaceful transfer of presidential power. \\n By engaging in insurrection against the \\n   Constitution, President Trump disqualified himself \\n from public office.  As we heard earlier, President \\n Trump\\'s main argument is that this Court should \\n create a special exemption to Section 3 that would \\n apply to him and to him alone. He says Section 3 \\n   disqualifies all oath-breaking insurrectionists, \\n   except a former president who never before held other \\n state or federal office. \\n There is no possible rationale for such an \\n\\n \\n   exemption, and the Court should reject the -- the --\\n the claim that the Framers made an extraordinary \\n   mistake.  Section 3 uses deliberately broad language \\n to cover all positions of federal power requiring an \\n oath to the Constitution. \\n My friend relies on a claimed difference \\n between \"an office under\" and \"an officer of the \\n   United States,\" but this case does not come down to \\n mere prepositions.  The two phrases are two sides of \\n the same coin, referring to any federal office or to \\n   anyone who holds one. \\n President Trump\\'s other arguments for \\n reversal ignore the constitutional role of the states \\n in running presidential elections.  Under Article II \\n and the Tenth Amendment, states have the power to \\n ensure that their citizens\\' electoral votes are not \\n wasted on a candidate who is constitutionally barred \\n from holding office. \\n States are allowed to safeguard their \\n ballots by excluding those who are under age, \\n   foreign-born, running for a third presidential term, \\n or, as here, those who have engaged in insurrection \\n against the Constitution, in violation of their oath. \\n I welcome the Court\\'s questions.

But nor \\n can it exercise its power in a manner that would \\n violate the constitutional holding of U.S. Term \\n   Limits against Thornton and they cannot use the \\n   Electors Clause as an excuse to impose additional \\n   qualifications for the presidency that go beyond what \\n the Constitution enumerates in Article II. \\n And the problem with what the Colorado \\n Supreme Court has done is they have in a way changed \\n the criteria in Section 3 by making it a requirement \\n that must be met before the candidate who is seeking \\n   office actually holds the office, effectively moving \\n forward in time the deadline that the candidate has \\n for obtaining a congressional waiver. \\n There has still been no answer from the \\n   Anderson litigants on how to distinguish the \\n congressional residency cases, where the courts of \\n appeals, not decisions from this Court, but the \\n courts of appeals in applying this Court 's holding \\n\\n \\n in U.S. Term Limits have unanimously disapproved \\n state laws requiring congressional candidates to show \\n that they inhabit the state from which they seek \\n   election prior to Election Day. \\n And there still in our view is no possible \\n way to distinguish those from the situation below in \\n the Colorado Supreme Court. \\n Mr. Murray also invoked the de facto \\n officer doctrine as a possible way to mitigate the \\n dramatic consequences that would follow from the \\n decision of this Court that rejects the rationale of \\n   Griffin's Case and that also agrees with Mr. Murray's \\n   contentions that President Trump is disqualified from \\n holding office on account of the events of January \\n 6th and that he's covered by Section 3 as an officer \\n of the United States. \\n This Court's recent decisions in Lucia and \\n Arthrex held that officers who are unconstitutionally \\n appointed under Article II and that made decisions \\n under the APA that were attacked as invalid, those \\n   decisions were still vacated and this Court did not \\n use any variant of the de facto officer doctrine to \\n salvage the decisions that were made by these \\n   unconstitutionally appointed officers. \\n There is no way to escape the conclusion \\n\\n \\n that if this Court rejects Griffin's Case and also \\n   agrees with Mr. Murray's construction of Section 3 \\n that every executive action taken by the Trump \\n Administration during its last two weeks in office is \\n   vulnerable to attack under the APA and, further, that \\n if President Trump is reelected and sworn in as the \\n next president, that any executive action that he \\n takes could be attacked in federal court by anyone \\n who continues to believe that President Trump is \\n barred from office under Section 3. \\n I'm happy to answer any other questions \\n that the Court may have. \"},\n",

       "  'words': ' Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Colorado Supreme Court held that President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Colorado Supreme Court\\'s decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons. The first reason is that President Trump is not covered by Section 3 because the president is not \"an officer of the United States\" as that term is used throughout the Constitution. \"Officer of the United States\" refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals, such as the President or members of Congress. This is clear from the Commissions Clause, the Impeachment Clause, and the Appointments Clause, each of which uses \"officers of the United States\" to refer only to appointed and not elected officials. The second reason is that Section 3 cannot be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 because Congress can lift that disability after the candidate is elected but before he takes office. A state cannot exclude any candidate for federal office from the ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that does so is violating the holding of Term Limits by altering the Constitution\\'s qualifications for federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court\\'s decision is no different from a state residency law that requires members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to Election Day, when the Constitution requires only that members of Congress inhabit the state that they represent when elected. In both situations, a state is accelerating the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed qualification and is thereby violating the holding of Term Limits. And in this situation, a ruling from this Court that affirms the decision below would not only violate Term Limits but take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans.

We need to say something more than that because a non-self-executing treaty or a non-self-executing constitutional provision normally can still be enforced by a state if it chooses to enact legislation. The holding of Griffin's Case goes beyond even that by saying that a state is not allowed to implement or enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment unless and until Congress enacts implementing legislation allowing it to do so. So, under Griffin's Case, which we believe is correctly decided -- the Anderson litigants disagree with us on that point -- but, if this Court were to adhere to the holding of Griffin's Case, there would not be any role for the states in enforcing Section 3 unless Congress were to enact a statute that gives them that authority. \"},\n",

This happened frequently in the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, where Confederate insurrectionists were elected to Congress, and sometimes they obtained a waiver; sometimes they did not. And each House would determine for itself whether to seat that elected insurrectionist because each House is the sole judge of the qualifications of its members. So, if a state banned even an admitted insurrectionist from the ballot, it would be adding to and altering the Constitution's qualifications for office because, under Section 3, the candidate need only qualify during the time the candidate holds the office to which he's been elected.

       "  'words': ' There are three textual inferences that could be drawn from each of those provisions Your Honor just mentioned, but the Commissions Clause, I think, is the strongest because it says the president shall, you know, \"commission all the Officers of the United States.\" \"Shall\" is mandatory. \"All\" is all-encompassing. And the president doesn\\'t commission himself, and he can\\'t commission himself. So that\\'s one of the first problems. I think the Anderson litigants are trying to say, you know, there\\'s somehow an implied exception there because the president obviously can\\'t commission himself, so we should construe that to mean all officers of the United States besides the president. But you also have members of Congress who are not commissioned by the president, and that\\'s because they\\'re not officers of the United States. So the only sensible distinction that we can see, given the language of the Commissions Clause, is that officers of -- of the United States are appointed officials, and elected officials, such as members of Congress and the president and the vice president, are not. And the Impeachment Clause reinforces that. \"The President, [the] Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office [upon] Impeachment for, and Conviction of ... [all] high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" The president and the vice president are listed separately from officers of the United States.

For the first time in history, the attack was incited by a sitting president of the United States to disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power. By engaging in insurrection against the Constitution, President Trump disqualified himself from public office. As we heard earlier, President Trump\\'s main argument is that this Court should create a special exemption to Section 3 that would apply to him and to him alone. He says Section 3 disqualifies all oath-breaking insurrectionists, except a former president who never before held other state or federal office. There is no possible rationale for such an exemption, and the Court should reject the -- the -- the claim that the Framers made an extraordinary mistake. Section 3 uses deliberately broad language to cover all positions of federal power requiring an oath to the Constitution. My friend relies on a claimed difference between \"an office under\" and \"an officer of the United States,\" but this case does not come down to mere prepositions. The two phrases are two sides of the same coin, referring to any federal office or to anyone who holds one. President Trump\\'s other arguments for reversal ignore the constitutional role of the states in running presidential elections. Under Article II and the Tenth Amendment, states have the power to ensure that their citizens\\' electoral votes are not wasted on a candidate who is constitutionally barred from holding office. States are allowed to safeguard their ballots by excluding those who are under age, foreign-born, running for a third presidential term, or, as here, those who have engaged in insurrection against the Constitution, in violation of their oath.

But that prerogative under Article II must be exercised in a manner consistent with other constitutional provisions and restrictions. And Justice Kagan alluded to one of those restrictions that might be imposed by the First Amendment, but there are others. A state cannot use its power under Article II's Electors Clause to instruct its presidential electors only to vote for white candidates. That would violate the Equal Protection Clause. But nor can it exercise its power in a manner that would violate the constitutional holding of U.S. Term Limits against Thornton and they cannot use the Electors Clause as an excuse to impose additional qualifications for the presidency that go beyond what the Constitution enumerates in Article II. And the problem with what the Colorado Supreme Court has done is they have in a way changed the criteria in Section 3 by making it a requirement that must be met before the candidate who is seeking office actually holds the office, effectively moving forward in time the deadline that the candidate has for obtaining a congressional waiver. There has still been no answer from the Anderson litigants on how to distinguish the congressional residency cases, where the courts of appeals, not decisions from this Court, but the courts of appeals in applying this Court 's holding in U.S. Term Limits have unanimously disapproved state laws requiring congressional candidates to show that they inhabit the state from which they seek election prior to Election Day. And there still in our view is no possible way to distinguish those from the situation below in the Colorado Supreme Court. Mr. Murray also invoked the de facto officer doctrine as a possible way to mitigate the dramatic consequences that would follow from the decision of this Court that rejects the rationale of Griffin's Case and that also agrees with Mr. Murray's contentions that President Trump is disqualified from holding office on account of the events of January 6th and that he's covered by Section 3 as an officer of the United States. This Court's recent decisions in Lucia and Arthrex held that officers who are unconstitutionally appointed under Article II and that made decisions under the APA that were attacked as invalid, those decisions were still vacated and this Court did not use any variant of the de facto officer doctrine to salvage the decisions that were made by these unconstitutionally appointed officers. There is no way to escape the conclusion that if this Court rejects Griffin's Case and also agrees with Mr. Murray's construction of Section 3 that every executive action taken by the Trump Administration during its last two weeks in office is vulnerable to attack under the APA and, further, that if President Trump is reelected and sworn in as the next president, that any executive action that he takes could be attacked in federal court by anyone who continues to believe that President Trump is barred from office under Section 3.

So I was thinking what is the next big piece of legislation on the horizon and who knows, don't have a crystal ball, but I'm going to say -- I'm going to guess that it's artificial intelligence. So let's imagine Congress enacts an artificial intelligence bill and it has all kinds of delegations, maybe it creates an agency for the purpose or maybe it uses existing agencies and it has all kinds of delegations to that agency or agencies about how to regulate artificial intelligence so that this nation can capture the -- the -- the opportunities but also meet the challenges of that. And then, just by the nature of things and especially the nature of the subject, there are going to be all kinds of places where, although there's not an explicit delegation, Congress has, in effect, left a gap.

And what Congress wants, we presume, is for people who actually know about AI to decide those questions. And also, those same people who know about AI are people who, to some degree in some way, are accountable to the political process. They have constituencies. They have fact-finding abilities. They are obligated to go consult with people. They report to a president, who needs to be elected. In all kinds of ways, both with -- with respect to expertise and with respect to their connections to the public and to other policymaking entities, those are the people Congress wants to decide questions about AI.

So I was thinking what is the next big piece of legislation on the horizon and who knows, don't have a crystal ball, but I'm going to say -- I'm going to guess that it's artificial intelligence. So let's imagine Congress enacts an artificial intelligence bill and it has all kinds of delegations, maybe it creates an agency for the purpose or maybe it uses existing agencies and it has all kinds of delegations to that agency or agencies about how to regulate artificial intelligence so that this nation can capture the -- the -- the opportunities but also meet the challenges of that. And then, just by the nature of things and especially the nature of the subject, there are going to be all kinds of places where, although there's not an explicit delegation, Congress has, in effect, left a gap. It has created an ambiguity. And what Congress is thinking is, do we want courts to fill that gap, or do we want an agency to fill that gap? When the normal techniques of legal interpretation have run out, on the matter of artificial intelligence, what does Congress want, Mr. Martinez?   \n",

The congressional intent, it -- you know, the -- the delegation is not explicit on the face of this statute, but what we're thinking is Congress knows things about different institutions, about what they know, about what they're competent with respect to, and Congress knows that this Court and lower courts are not competent with respect to deciding all the questions about AI that are going to come up in the future. And what Congress wants, we presume, is for people who actually know about AI to decide those questions. And also, those same people who know about AI are people who, to some degree in some way, are accountable to the political process. They have constituencies. They have fact-finding abilities. They are obligated to go consult with people. They report to a president, who needs to be elected. In all kinds of ways, both with -- with respect to expertise and with respect to their connections to the public and to other policymaking entities, those are the people Congress wants to decide questions about AI. We don't even know what the questions are about AI, let alone the answers to them, \"we\" being the Court.   \n",

    "There's certainly more investigations you can do into the words here. There are fancier ways of analyzing natural language, but, for the purposes of the next week I don't think that is necessary unless it's something that you understand and are interested in doing. I believe that you doing your own analyses through word searches can be just as powerful if not more powerful than engaging ML/AI (though there are certainly useful approaches via those tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number one priority is to merge this with another data set. We have some that we have scraped already, and I highly recommend using those.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could get information from the opinions (but I don't recommend engaging with the opinion docs):\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/23\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the individual docket information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The docket information does include the lower court were the case originated,. So if you did want to map you could go in that direction. But the main challenge is to think about what the map with then show either by case, or by lower court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I believe that the potentially strongest approach would be to come up with categories for all of these cases. That would entail doing your own research. As I mentioned, do not find a source for what are the standard categories. Actually look at the cases and come up with your own categories, and add them to your main data frame, so you attach them to the dockets. I would say somewhere between six and 10 categories is a fine guideline. The point here would be to group/aggregate these transcripts based on the categories you choose. And then do analyses in pandas/plots (or map by lower courts).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, of course, there are many other interpretive approaches, and you might want to just come up with your own. That is the main goal of these projects, is to create your own point of view/interpretive lens by building a data set. "
